the bhagavadgt is the best known and the most frequently translated of vedic religious texts why it should be so appealing to the western mind is an interesting question it has drama for its setting is a scene of two great armies banners flying drawn up opposite one another on the field poised for battle it has ambiguity and the fact that arjuna and his charioteer ka are carrying on their dialogue between the two armies suggests the indecision of arjuna about the basic question should he enter battle against and kill those who are friends and kinsmen it has mystery as ka demonstrates to arjuna his cosmic form it has a properly complicated view of the ways of the religious life and treats of the paths of knowledge works discipline and faith and their interrelationships problems that have bothered adherents of other religions in other times and places the devotion spoken of is a deliberate means of religious satisfaction not a mere outpouring of poetic emotion next to the bhgavatapura a long work from south india the gt is the text most frequently quoted in the philosophical writings of the gauya vaiava school the school represented by swami bhaktivedanta as the latest in a long succession of teachers it can be said that this school of vaiavism was founded or revived by r kacaitanya mahprabhu 14861533 in bengal and that it is currently the strongest single religious force in the eastern part of the indian subcontinent the gauiya vaiava school for whom ka is himself the supreme god and not merely an incarnation of another deity sees bhakti as an immediate and powerful religious force consisting of love between man and god its discipline consists of devoting all ones actions to the deity and one listens to the stories of ka from the sacred texts one chants kas name washes bathes and dresses the mrti of ka feeds him and takes the remains of the food offered to him thus absorbing his grace one does these things and many more until one has been changed the devotee has become transformed into one close to ka and sees the lord face to face swami bhaktivedanta comments upon the gt from this point of view and that is legitimate more than that in this translation the western reader has the unique opportunity of seeing how a krsna devotee interprets his own texts it is the vedic exegetical tradition justly famous in action this book is then a welcome addition from many points of view it can serve as a valuable textbook for the college student it allows us to listen to a skilled interpreter explicating a text which has profound religious meaning it gives us insights into the original and highly convincing ideas of the gauiya vaiava school in providing the sanskrit in both devanagari and transliteration it offers the sanskrit specialist the opportunity to reinterpret or debate particular sanskrit meaningsalthough i think there will be little disagreement about the quality of the swamis sanskrit scholarship and finally for the nonspecialist there is readable english and a devotional attitude which cannot help but move the sensitive reader and there are the paintings which incredibly as it may seem to those familiar with contemporary indian religious art were done by american devotees the scholar the student of gauiya vaiavism and the increasing number of western readers interested in classical vedic thought have been done a service by swami bhaktivedanta by bringing us a new and living interpretation of a text already known to many he has increased our understanding manyfold and arguments for understanding in these days of estrangement need not be made professor edward c dimock jr department of south asian languages and civilization university of chicago preface originally i wrote bhagavadgt as it is in the form in which it is presented now when this book was first published the original manuscript was unfortunately cut short to less than 400 pages without illustrations and without explanations for most of the original verses of the rmad bhagavadgt in all of my other booksrmad bhgavatam r opaniad etcthe system is that i give the original verse its english transliteration wordforword sanskritenglish equivalents translations and purports this makes the book very authentic and scholarly and makes the meaning selfevident i was not very happy therefore when i had to minimize my original manuscript but later on when the demand for bhagavadgt as it is considerably increased i was requested by many scholars and devotees to present the book in its original form and messrs macmillan and co agreed to publish the complete edition thus the present attempt is to offer the original manuscript of this great book of knowledge with full parampar explanation in order to establish the ka consciousness movement more soundly and progressively our ka consciousness movement is genuine historically authorized natural and transcendental due to its being based on bhagavadgt as it is it is gradually becoming the most popular movement in the entire world especially amongst the younger generation it is becoming more and more interesting to the older generation also older gentlemen are becoming interested so much so that the fathers and grandfathers of my disciples are encouraging us by becoming life members of our great society the international society for krishna consciousness in los angeles many fathers and mothers used to come to see me to express their feelings of gratitude for my leading the ka consciousness movement throughout the entire world some of them said that it is greatly fortunate for the americans that i have started the ka consciousness movement in america but actually the original father of this movement is lord ka himself since it was started a very long time ago but is coming down to human society by disciplic succession if i have any credit in this connection it does not belong to me personally but it is due to my eternal spiritual master his divine grace om viupda paramahasa parivrjakcrya 108 r rmad bhaktisiddhnta sarasvat gosvm mahrja prabhupda if personally i have any credit in this matter it is only that i have tried to present bhagavadgt as it is without adulteration before my presentation of bhagavadgt as it is almost all the english editions of bhagavad gt were introduced to fulfill someones personal ambition but our attempt in presenting bhagavadgt as it is is to present the mission of the supreme personality of godhead ka our business is to present the will of ka not that of any mundane speculator like the politician philosopher or scientist for they have very little knowledge of ka despite all their other knowledge when ka says manman bhava madbhakto madyj m namaskuru etc we unlike the socalled scholars do not say that ka and his inner spirit are different ka is absolute and there is no difference between kas name kas form kas quality kas pastimes etc this absolute position of ka is difflcult to understand for any person who is not a devotee of ka in the parampar disciplic succession system generally the socalled scholars politicians philosophers and svms without perfect knowledge of ka try to banish or kill ka when writing commentary on bhagavadgt such unauthorized commentary upon bhagavadgt is known as myvdbhya and lord caitanya has warned us about these unauthorized men lord caitanya clearly says that anyone who tries to understand bhagavadgt from the myvd point of view will commit a great blunder the result of such a blunder will be that the misguided student of bhagavadgt will certainly be bewildered on the path of spiritual guidance and will not be able to go back home back to godhead our only purpose is to present this bhagavadgt as it is in order to guide the conditioned student to the same purpose for which ka descends to this planet once in a day of brahm or every 8600000000 years this purpose is stated in bhagavadgt and we have to accept it as it is otherwise there is no point in trying to understand the bhagavadgt and its speaker lord ka lord ka first spoke bhagavadgt to the sungod some hundreds of millions of years ago we have to accept this fact and thus understand the historical significance of bhagavadgt without misinterpretation on the authority of ka to interpret bhagavadgt without any reference to the will of ka is the greatest offense in order to save oneself from this offense one has to understand the lord as the supreme personality of godhead as he was directly understood by arjuna lord kas first disciple such understanding of bhagavadgt is really profitable and authorized for the welfare of human society in fulfilling the mission of life the ka consciousness movement is essential in human society for it offers the highest perfection of life how this is so is explained fully in the bhagavadgt unfortunately mundane wranglers have taken advantage of bhagavadgt to push forward their demonic propensities and mislead people regarding right understanding of the simple principles of life everyone should know how god or ka is great and everyone should know the factual position of the living entities everyone should know that a living entity is eternally a servant and that unless one serves ka one has to serve illusion in different varieties of the three modes of material nature and thus perpetually one has to wander within the cycle of birth and death even the socalled liberated myvd speculator has to undergo this process this knowledge constitutes a great science and each and every living being has to hear it for his own interest people in general especially in this age of kali are enamored by the external energy of ka and they wrongly think that by advancement of material comforts every man will be happy they have no knowledge that the material or external nature is very strong for everyone is strongly bound by the stringent laws of material nature a living entity is happily the part and parcel of the lord and thus his natural function is to render immediate service to the lord by the spell of illusion one tries to be happy by serving his personal sense gratification in different forms which will never make him happy instead of satisfying his own personal material senses he has to satisfy the senses of the lord that is the highest perfection of life the lord wants this and he demands it one has to understand this central point of bhagavadgt our ka consciousness movement is teaching the whole world this central point and because we are not polluting the theme of bhagavadgt as it is anyone seriously interested in deriving benefit by studying the bhagavadgt must take help from the ka consciousness movement for practical understanding of bhagavadgt under the direct guidance of the lord we hope therefore that people will derive the greatest benefit by studying bhagavadgt as it is as we have presented it here and if even one man becomes a pure devotee of the lord we shall consider our attempt a success 12 may 1971 sydney australia bhagavadgt as it is introduction om ajnatimirndhasya jnjanaalkay cakur unmlita yena tasmai rgurave nama

vedic knowledge and one of the most important upaniads in vedic literature of course there are many commentaries in english on the bhagavadgt and one may question the necessity for another one this present edition can be explained in the following way recently an american lady asked me to recommend an english translation of bhagavadgt of course in america there are so many editions of bhagavadgt available in english but as far as i have seen not only in america but also in india none of them can be strictly said to be authoritative because in almost every one of them the commentator has expressed his own opinions without touching the spirit of bhagavadgt as it is the spirit of bhagavadgt is mentioned in bhagavadgt itself it is just like this if we want to take a particular medicine then we have to follow the directions written on the label we cannot take the medicine according to our own whim or the direction of a friend it must be taken according to the directions on the label or the directions given by a physician similarly bhagavadgt should be taken or accepted as it is directed by the speaker himself the speaker of bhagavadgt is lord r ka he is mentioned on every page of bhagavadgt as the supreme personality of godhead bhagavn of course the word bhagavnsometimes refers to any powerful person or any powerful demigod and certainly here bhagavn designates lord r ka as a great personality but at the same time we should know that lord r ka is the supreme personality of godhead as is confirmed by all great cryas spiritual masters like akarcrya rmnujcrya madhvcrya nimbrka svm r caitanya mahprabhu and many other authorities of vedic knowledge in india the lord himself also establishes himself as the supreme personality of godhead in the bhagavadgt and he is accepted as such in the brahma sahit and all the puras especially the rmadbhgavatam known as the bhgavata pura kas tu bhagavn svayam therefore we should take bhagavadgt as it is directed by the personality of godhead himself in the fourth chapter of the gt the lord says 1 ima vivasvate yoga proktavn aham avyayam vivasvn manave prha manur ikvkave bravt 2 eva paramparprptam ima rjarayo vidu sa kleneha mahat yogo naa parantapa 3 sa evya may te dya yoga prokta purtana bhakto si me sakh ceti rahasya hy etad uttamam here the lord informs arjuna that this system of yoga the bhagavadgt was first spoken to the sungod and the sungod explained it to manu and manu explained it to ikvku and in that way by disciplic succession one speaker after another this yoga system has been coming down but in the course of time it has become lost consequently the lord has to speak it again this time to arjuna on the battlefield of kuruketra he tells arjuna that he is relating this supreme secret to him because he is his devotee and his friend the purport of this is that bhagavadgt is a treatise which is especially meant for the devotee of the lord there are three classes of transcendentalists namely the jn the yog and the bhakta or the impersonalist the meditator and the devotee here the lord clearly tells arjuna that he is making him the first receiver of a new parampar disciplic succession because the old succession was broken it was the lords wish therefore to establish another parampar in the same line of thought that was coming down from the sungod to others and it was his wish that his teaching be distributed anew by arjuna he wanted arjuna to become the authority in understanding the bhagavad gt so we see that bhagavadgt is instructed to arjuna especially because arjuna was a devotee of the lord a direct student of ka and his intimate friend therefore bhagavadgt is best understood by a person who has qualities similar to arjunas that is to say he must be a devotee in a direct relationship with the lord as soon as one becomes a devotee of the lord he also has a direct relationship with the lord that is a very elaborate subject matter but briefly it can be stated that a devotee is in a relationship with the supreme personality of godhead in one of five different ways 1 one may be a devotee in a passive state 2 one may be a devotee in an active state 3 one may be a devotee as a friend 4 one may be a devotee as a parent 5 one may be a devotee as a conjugal lover arjuna was in a relationship with the lord as friend of course there is a gulf of difference between this friendship and the friendship found in the material world this is transcendental friendship which cannot be had by everyone of course everyone has a particular relationship with the lord and that relationship is evoked by the perfection of devotional service but in the present status of our life we have not only forgotten the supreme lord but we have forgotten our eternal relationship with the lord every living being out of many many billions and trillions of living beings has a particular relationship with the lord eternally that is called svarpaby the process of devotional service one can revive that svarpaand that stage is called svarpasi ddhiperfection of ones constitutional position so arjuna was a devotee and he was in touch with the supreme lord in friendship how arjuna accepted this bhagavadgt should be noted his manner of acceptance is given in the tenth chapter 12 arjuna uvca para brahma para dhma pavitra parama bhavn purua vata divyam didevam aja vibhum 13 hus tvm aya sarve devarir nradas tath asito devalo vysa svaya caiva bravi me 14 sarvam etad ta manye yan m vadasi keava na hi te bhagavan vyakti vidur dev na dnav arjuna said you are the supreme brahman the ultimate the supreme abode and purifier the absolute truth and the eternal divine person you are the primal god transcendental and original and you are the unborn and allpervading beauty all the great sages like nrada asita devala and vysa proclaim this of you and now you yourself are declaring it to me o ka i totally accept as truth all that you have told me neither the gods nor demons o lord know thy personality bg 10 1214 after hearing bhagavadgt from the supreme personality of godhead arjuna accepted ka as para brahma the supreme brahman every living being is brahman but the supreme living being or the supreme personality of godhead is the supreme brahman para dhma means that he is the supreme rest or abode of everything pavitram means that he is pure untainted by material contamination puruam means that he is the supreme enjoyer divyam transcendental didevam the supreme personality of godhead ajam the unborn and vibhum the greatest the allpervading now one may think that because ka was the friend of arjuna arjuna was telling him all this by way of flattery but arjuna just to drive out this kind of doubt from the minds of the readers of bhagavad gt substantiates these praises in the next verse when he says that ka is accepted as the supreme personality of godhead not only by himself but by authorities like the sage nrada asita devala vysadeva and so on these are great personalities who distribute the vedic knowledge as it is accepted by all cryas therefore arjuna tells ka that he accepts whatever he says to be completely perfect sarvam etad ta manye i accept everything you say to be true arjuna also says that the personality of the lord is very difficult to understand and that he cannot be known even by the great demigods this means that the lord cannot even be known by personalities greater than human beings so how can a human being understand r ka without becoming his devotee therefore bhagavadgt should be taken up in a spirit of devotion one should not think that he is equal to ka nor should he think that ka is an ordinary personality or even a very great personality lord r ka is the supreme personality of godhead at least theoretically according to the statements of bhagavadgt or the statements of arjuna the person who is trying to understand the bhagavadgt we should therefore at least theoretically accept r ka as the supreme personality of godhead and with that submissive spirit we can understand the bhagavadgt unless one reads the bhagavadgt in a submissive spirit it is very difficult to understand bhagavadgt because it is a great mystery just what is the bhagavadgt the purpose of bhagavad gt is to deliver mankind from the nescience of material existence every man is in difficulty in so many ways as arjuna also was in difficulty in having to fight the battle of kuruketra arjuna surrendered unto r ka and consequently this bhagavadgt was spoken not only arjuna but every one of us is full of anxieties because of this material existence our very existence is in the atmosphere of nonexistence actually we are not meant to be threatened by nonexistence our existence is eternal but somehow or other we are put into asat asat refers to that which does not exist out of so many human beings who are suffering there are a few who are actually inquiring about their position as to what they are why they are put into this awkward position and so on unless one is awakened to this position of questioning his suffering unless he realizes that he doesnt want suffering but rather wants to make a solution to all sufferings then one is not to be considered a perfect human being humanity begins when this sort of inquiry is awakened in ones mind in the brahmastra this inquiry is called brahmajijs every activity of the human being is to be considered a failure unless he inquires about the nature of the absolute therefore those who begin to question why they are suffering or where they came from and where they shall go after death are proper students for understanding bhagavadgt the sincere student should also have a firm respect for the supreme personality of godhead such a student was arjuna lord ka descends specifically to reestablish the real purpose of life when man forgets that purpose even then out of many many human beings who awaken there may be one who actually enters the spirit of understanding his position and for him this bhagavad gt is spoken actually we are all followed by the tiger of nescience but the lord is very merciful upon living entities especially human beings to this end he spoke the bhagavadgt making his friend arjuna his student being an associate of lord ka arjuna was above all ignorance but arjuna was put into ignorance on the battlefield of kuruketra just to question lord ka about the problems of life so that the lord could explain them for the benefit of future generations of human beings and chalk out the plan of life then man could act accordingly and perfect the mission of human life the subject of the bhagavadgt entails the comprehension of five basic truths first of all the science of god is explained and then the constitutional position of the living entities jvas there is vara which means controller and there are jvas the living entities which are controlled if a living entity says that he is not controlled but that he is free then he is insane the living being is controlled in every respect at least in his conditioned life so in the bhagavadgt the subject matter deals with the vara the supreme controller and the jvas the controlled living entities prakti material nature and time the duration of existence of the whole universe or the manifestation of material nature and karma activity are also discussed the cosmic manifestation is full of different activities all living entities are engaged in different activities from bhagavadgt we must learn what god is what the living entities are what prakti is what the cosmic manifestation is and how it is controlled by time and what the activities of the living entities are out of these five basic subject matters in bhagavadgt it is established that the supreme godhead or ka or brahman or supreme controller or paramtmyou may use whatever name you likeis the greatest of all the living beings are in quality like the supreme controller for instance the lord has control over the universal affairs over material nature etc as will be explained in the later chapters of bhagavadgt material nature is not independant she is acting under the directions of the supreme lord as lord ka says prakti is working under my direction when we see wonderful things happening in the cosmic nature we should know that behind this cosmic manifestation there is a controller nothing could be manifested without being controlled it is childish not to consider the controller for instance a child may think that an automobile is quite wonderful to be able to run without a horse or other animal pulling it but a sane man knows the nature of the automobiles engineering arrangement he always knows that behind the machinery there is a man a driver similarly the supreme lord is a driver under whose direction everything is working now the jvas or the living entities have been accepted by the lord as we will note in the later chapters as his parts and parcels a particle of gold is also gold a drop of water from the ocean is also salty and similarly we the living entities being part and parcel of the supreme controller svara or bhagavn lord r ka have all the qualities of the supreme lord in minute quantity because we are minute varas subordinate varas we are trying to control nature as presently we are trying to control space or planets and this tendency to control is there because it is in ka but although we have a tendency to lord it over material nature we should know that we are not the supreme controller this is explained in bhagavadgt what is material nature this is also explained in gt as inferior prakti inferior nature the living entity is explained as the superior prakti prakti is always under control whether inferior or superior prakti is female and she is controlled by the lord just as the activities of a wife are controlled by the husband prakti is always subordinate predominated by the lord who is the predominator the living entities and material nature are both predominated controlled by the supreme lord according to the gt the living entities although parts and parcels of the supreme lord are to be considered prakti this is clearly mentioned in the seventh chapter fifth verse of bhagavadgt apareyam itas tv anym this prakti is my lower nature prakti viddhi me parm jvabht mahbho yayeda dhryate jagat and beyond this there is another prakti jvabhtm the living entity prakti itself is constituted by three qualities the mode of goodness the mode of passion and the mode of ignorance above these modes there is eternal time and by a combination of these modes of nature and under the control and purview of eternal time there are activities which are called karma these activities are being carried out from time immemorial and we are suffering or enjoying the fruits of our activities for instance suppose i am a businessman and have worked very hard with intelligence and have amassed a great bank balance then i am an enjoyer but then say i have lost all my money in business then i am a sufferer similarly in every field of life we enjoy the results of our work or we suffer the results this is called karma vara the supreme lord jva the living entity prakti nature eternal time and karma activity are all explained in the bhagavad gt out of these five the lord the living entities material nature and time are eternal the manifestation of prakti may be temporary but it is not false some philosophers say that the manifestation of material nature is false but according to the philosophy of bhagavadgt or according to the philosophy of the vaiavas this is not so the manifestation of the world is not accepted as false it is accepted as real but temporary it is likened unto a cloud which moves across the sky or the coming of the rainy season which nourishes grains as soon as the rainy season is over and as soon as the cloud goes away all the crops which were nourished by the rain dry up similarly this material manifestation takes place at a certain interval stays for a while and then disappears such are the workings of prakti but this cycle is working eternally therefore prakrti is eternal it is not false the lord refers to this as my prakti this material nature is the separated energy of the supreme lord and similarly the living entities are also the energy of the supreme lord but they are not separated they are eternally related so the lord the living entity material nature and time are all interrelated and are all eternal however the other item karma is not eternal the effects of karma may be very old indeed we are suffering or enjoying the results of our activities from time immemorial but we can change the results of our karma or our activity and this change depends on the perfection of our knowledge we are engaged in various activities undoubtedly we do not know what sort of activities we should adopt to gain relief from the actions and reactions of all these activities but this is also explained in the bhagavadgt the position of svara is that of supreme consciousness the jvas or the living entities being parts and parcels of the supreme lord are also conscious both the living entity and material nature are explained as prakti the energy of the supreme lord but one of the two the jva is conscious the other prakti is not conscious that is the difference therefore the jvaprakti is called superior because the jva has consciousness which is similar to the lords the lords is supreme consciousness however and one should not claim that the jva the living entity is also supremely conscious the living being cannot be supremely conscious at any stage of his perfection and the theory that he can be so is a misleading theory conscious he may be but he is not perfectly or supremely conscious the distinction between the jva and the vara will be explained in the thirteenth chapter of bhagavadgt the lord is ketraja conscious as is the living being but the living being is conscious of his particular body whereas the lord is conscious of all bodies because he lives in the heart of every living being he is conscious of the psychic movements of the particular jvas we should not forget this it is also explained that the paramtm the supreme personality of godhead is living in everyones heart as vara as the controller and that he is giving directions for the living entity to act as he desires the living entity forgets what to do first of all he makes a determination to act in a certain way and then he is entangled in the acts and reactions of his own karma after giving up one type of body he enters another type of body as we put on and take off old clothes as the soul thus migrates he suffers the actions and reactions of his past activities these activities can be changed when the living being is in the mode of goodness in sanity and understands what sort of activities he should adopt if he does so then all the actions and reactions of his past activities can be changed consequently karma is not eternal therefore we stated that of the five items vara jva prakti time and karma four are eternal whereas karma is not eternal the supreme conscious vara is similar to the living entity in this way both the consciousness of the lord and that of the living entity are transcendental it is not that consciousness is generated by the association of matter that is a mistaken idea the theory that consciousness develops under certain circumstances of material combination is not accepted in the bhagavadgt consciousness may be pervertedly reflected by the covering of material circumstances just as light reflected through colored glass may appear to be a certain color but the consciousness of the lord is not materially affected lord ka says maydhyakea prakti when he descends into the material universe his consciousness is not materially affected if he were so affected he would be unfit to speak on transcendental matters as he does in the bhagavadgt one cannot say anything about the transcendental world without being free from materially contaminated consciousness so the lord is not materially contaminated our consciousness at the present moment however is materially contaminated the bhagavadgt teaches that we have to purify this materially contaminated consciousness in pure consciousness our actions will be dovetailed to the will of vara and that will make us happy it is not that we have to cease all activities rather our activities are to be purified and purified activities are called bhakti activities in bhakti appear to be like ordinary activities but they are not contaminated an ignorant person may see that a devotee is acting or working like an ordinary man but such a person with a poor fund of knowledge does not know that the activities of the devotee or of the lord are not contaminated by impure consciousness or matter they are transcendental to the three modes of nature we should know however that at this point our consciousness is contaminated when we are materially contaminated we are called conditioned false consciousness is exhibited under the impression that i am a product of material nature this is called false ego one who is absorbed in the thought of bodily conceptions cannot understand his situation bhagavad gt was spoken to liberate one from the bodily conception of life and arjuna put himself in this position in order to receive this information from the lord one must become free from the bodily conception of life that is the preliminary activity for the transcendentalist one who wants to become free who wants to become liberated must first of all learn that he is not this material body mukti or liberation means freedom from material consciousness in the rmadbhgavatam also the definition of liberation is given mukti means liberation from the contaminated consciousness of this material world and situation in pure consciousness all the instructions of bhagavadgt are intended to awaken this pure consciousness and therefore we find at the last stage of the gts instructions that ka is asking arjuna whether he is now in purified consciousness purified consciousness means acting in accordance with the instructions of the lord this is the whole sum and substance of purified consciousness consciousness is already there because we are part and parcel of the lord but for us there is the affinity of being affected by the inferior modes but the lord being the supreme is never affected that is the difference between the supreme lord and the conditioned souls what is this consciousness this consciousness is i am then what am i in contaminated consciousness i am means i am the lord of all i survey i am the enjoyer the world revolves because every living being thinks that he is the lord and creator of the material world material consciousness has two psychic divisions one is that i am the creator and the other is that i am the enjoyer but actually the supreme lord is both the creator and the enjoyer and the living entity being part and parcel of the supreme lord is neither the creator nor the enjoyer but a cooperator he is the created and the enjoyed for instance a part of a machine cooperates with the whole machine a part of the body cooperates with the whole body the hands feet eyes legs and so on are all parts of the body but they are not actually the enjoyers the stomach is the enjoyer the legs move the hands supply food the teeth chew and all parts of the body are engaged in satisfying the stomach because the stomach is the principal factor that nourishes the bodys organization therefore everything is given to the stomach one nourishes the tree by watering its root and one nourishes the body by feeding the stomach for if the body is to be kept in a healthy state then the parts of the body must cooperate to feed the stomach similarly the supreme lord is the enjoyer and the creator and we as subordinate living beings are meant to cooperate to satisfy him this cooperation will actually help us just as food taken by the stomach will help all other parts of the body if the fingers of the hand think that they should take the food themselves instead of giving it to the stomach then they will be frustrated the central figure of creation and of enjoyment is the supreme lord and the living entities are cooperators by cooperation they enjoy the relation is also like that of the master and the servant if the master is fully satisfied then the servant is satisfied similarly the supreme lord should be satisfied although the tendency to become the creator and the tendency to enjoy the material world are there also in the living entities because these tendencies are there in the supreme lord who has created the manifested cosmic world we shall find therefore in this bhagavadgt that the complete whole is comprised of the supreme controller the controlled living entities the cosmic manifestation eternal time and karma or activities and all of these are explained in this text all of these taken completely form the complete whole and the complete whole is called the supreme absolute truth the complete whole and the complete absolute truth are the supreme personality of godhead r ka all manifestations are due to his different energies he is the complete whole it is also explained in the gt that impersonal brahman is also subordinate to the complete brahman is more explicitly explained in the brahmastra to be like the rays of the sunshine the impersonal brahman is the shining rays of the supreme personality of godhead impersonal brahman is incomplete realization of the absolute whole and so also is the conception of paramtm in the twelfth chapter there it shall be seen that the supreme personality of godhead puruottama is above both impersonal brahman and the partial realization of paramtm the supreme personality of godhead is called saccidnandavigraha the brahmasahit begins in this way vara parama ka saccidnandavigraha andir dir govinda sarvakraakraam ka is the cause of all causes he is the primal cause and he is the very form of eternal being knowledge and bliss impersonal brahman realization is the realization of his sat being feature paramtm realization is the realization of the cit eternal knowledge feature but realization of the personality of godhead ka is realization of all the transcendental features sat cit and nanda being knowledge bliss in complete vigraha form people with less intelligence consider the supreme truth to be impersonal but he is a transcendental person and this is confirmed in all vedic literatures nityo nitynm cetana cetannm as we are all individual living beings and have our individuality the supreme absolute truth is also in the ultimate issue a person and realization of the personality of godhead is realization of all of the transcendental features the complete whole is not formless if he is formless or if he is less than any other thing then he cannot be the complete whole the complete whole must have everything within our experience and beyond our experience otherwise it cannot be complete the complete whole personality of godhead has immense potencies how ka is acting in different potencies is also explained in bhagavad gt this phenomenal world or material world in which we are placed is also complete in itself because the twentyfour elements of which this material universe is a temporary manifestation according to skhya philosophy are completely adjusted to produce complete resources which are necessary for the maintenance and subsistence of this universe there is nothing extraneous nor is there anything needed this manifestation has its own time fixed by the energy of the supreme whole and when its time is complete these temporary manifestations will be annihilated by the complete arrangement of the complete there is complete facility for the small complete units namely the living entities to realize the complete and all sorts of incompleteness are experienced due to incomplete knowledge of the complete so bhagavadgt contains the complete knowledge of vedic wisdom all vedic knowledge is infallible and hindus accept vedic knowledge to be complete and infallible for example cow dung is the stool of an animal and according to smti or vedic injunction if one touches the stool of an animal he has to take a bath to purify himself but in the vedic scriptures cow dung is considered to be a purifying agent one might consider this to be contradictory but it is accepted because it is vedic injunction and indeed by accepting this one will not commit a mistake subsequently it has been proved by modern science that cow dung contains all antiseptic properties so vedic knowledge is complete because it is above all doubts and mistakes and bhagavadgt is the essence of all vedic knowledge vedic knowledge is not a question of research our research work is imperfect because we are researching things with imperfect senses we have to accept perfect knowledge which comes down as is stated in bhagavadgt by the parampar disciplic succession we have to receive knowledge from the proper source in disciplic succession beginning with the supreme spiritual master the lord himself and handed down to a succession of spiritual masters arjuna the student who took lessons from lord r ka accepts everything that he says without contradicting him one is not allowed to accept one portion of bhagavadgt and not another no we must accept bhagavadgt without interpretation without deletion and without our own whimsical participation in the matter the gt should be taken as the most perfect presentation of vedic knowledge vedic knowledge is received from transcendental sources and the first words were spoken by the lord himself the words spoken by the lord are different from words spoken by a person of the mundane world who is infected with four defects a mundaner 1 is sure to commit mistakes 2 is invariably illusioned 3 has the tendency to cheat others and 4 is limited by imperfect senses with these four imperfections one cannot deliver perfect information of allpervading knowledge vedic knowledge is not imparted by such defective living entities it was imparted unto the heart of brahm the first created living being and brahm in his turn disseminated this knowledge to his sons and disciples as he originally received it from the lord the lord is pram allperfect and there is no possibility of his becoming subjected to the laws of material nature one should therefore be intelligent enough to know that the lord is the only proprietor of everything in the universe and that he is the original creator the creator of brahm in the eleventh chapter the lord is addressed as prapitmaha because brahm is addressed as pitmaha the grandfather and he is the creator of the grandfather so no one should claim to be the proprietor of anything one should accept only things which are set aside for him by the lord as his quota for his maintenance there are many examples given of how we are to utilize those things which are set aside for us by the lord this is also explained in bhagavadgt in the beginning arjuna decided that he should not fight in the battle of kuruketra this was his own decision arjuna told the lord that it was not possible for him to enjoy the kingdom after killing his own kinsmen this decision was based on the body because he was thinking that the body was himself and that his bodily relations or expansions were his brothers nephews brothersinlaw grandfathers and so on he was thinking in this way to satisfy his bodily demands bhagavadgt was spoken by the lord just to change this view and at the end arjuna decides to fight under the directions of the lord when he says kariye vacana tava i shall act according to thy word in this world man is not meant to toil like hogs he must be intelligent to realize the importance of human life and refuse to act like an ordinary animal a human being should realize the aim of his life and this direction is given in all vedic literatures and the essence is given in bhagavadgt vedic literature is meant for human beings not for animals animals can kill other living animals and there is no question of sin on their part but if a man kills an animal for the satisfaction of his uncontrolled taste he must be responsible for breaking the laws of nature in the bhagavadgt it is clearly explained that there are three kinds of activities according to the different modes of nature the activities of goodness of passion and of ignorance similarly there are three kinds of eatables also eatables in goodness passion and ignorance all of this is clearly described and if we properly utilize the instructions of bhagavadgt then our whole life will become purified and ultimately we will be able to reach the destination which is beyond this material sky that destination is called the santana sky the eternal spiritual sky in this material world we find that everything is temporary it comes into being stays for some time produces some byproducts dwindles and then vanishes that is the law of the material world whether we use as an example this body or a piece of fruit or anything but beyond this temporary world there is another world of which we have information this world consists of another nature which is santana eternal jva is also described as santana eternal and the lord is also described as santana in the eleventh chapter we have an intimate relationship with the lord and because we are all qualitatively onethe santanadhma or sky the santana supreme personality and the santana living entitiesthe whole purpose of bhagavadgt is to revive our santana occupation or santana dharma which is the eternal occupation of the living entity we are temporarily engaged in different activities but all of these activities can be purified when we give up all these temporary activities and take up the activities which are prescribed by the supreme lord that is called our pure life the supreme lord and his transcendental abode are both santana as are the living entities and the combined association of the supreme lord and the living entities in the santana abode is the perfection of human life the lord is very kind to the living entities because they are his sons lord ka declares in bhagavadgt sarvayoniuaha bjaprada pit i am the father of all of course there are all types of living entities according to their various karmas but here the lord claims that he is the father of all of them therefore the lord descends to reclaim all of these fallen conditioned souls to call them back to the santana eternal sky so that the santana living entities may regain their eternal santana positions in eternal association with the lord the lord comes himself in different incarnations or he sends his confidential servants as sons or his associates or cryas to reclaim the conditioned souls therefore santanadharma does not refer to any sectarian process of religion it is the eternal function of the eternal living entities in relationship with the eternal supreme lord santanadharma refers as stated previously to the eternal occupation of the living entity rmnujcrya has explained the word santana as that which has neither beginning nor end so when we speak of santanadharma we must take it for granted on the authority of r rmnujcrya that it has neither beginning nor end the english word religion is a little different from santana dharma religion conveys the idea of faith and faith may change one may have faith in a particular process and he may change this faith and adopt another but santanadharma refers to that activity which cannot be changed for instance liquidity cannot be taken from water nor can heat be taken from fire similarly the eternal function of the eternal living entity cannot be taken from the living entity santanadharma is eternally integral with the living entity when we speak of santanadharma therefore we must take it for granted on the authority of r rmnujcrya that it has neither beginning nor end that which has neither end nor beginning must not be sectarian for it cannot be limited by any boundaries yet those belonging to some sectarian faith will wrongly consider that santanadharma is also sectarian but if we go deeply into the matter and consider it in the light of modern science it is possible for us to see that santanadharma is the business of all the people of the worldnay of all the living entities of the universe nonsantana religious faith may have some beginning in the annals of human history but there is no beginning to the history of santanadharma because it remains eternally with the living entities insofar as the living entities are concerned the authoritative stras state that the living entity has neither birth nor death in the gt it is stated that the living entity is never born and he never dies he is eternal and indestructible and he continues to live after the destruction of his temporary material body in reference to the concept of santanadharma we must try to understand the concept of religion from the sanskrit root meaning of the word dharma refers to that which is constantly existing with the particular object we conclude that there is heat and light along with the fire without heat and light there is no meaning to the word fire similarly we must discover the essential part of the living being that part which is his constant companion that constant companion is his eternal quality and that eternal quality is his eternal religion when santana gosvm asked r caitanya mahprabhu about the svarpa of every living being the lord replied that the svarpa or constitutional position of the living being is the rendering of service to the supreme personality of godhead if we analyze this statement of lord caitanya we can easily see that every living being is constantly engaged in rendering service to another living being a living being serves other living beings in two capacities by doing so the living entity enjoys life the lower animals serve human beings as servants serve their master a serves b master b serves c master and c serves d master and so on under these circumstances we can see that one friend serves another friend the mother serves the son the wife serves the husband the husband serves the wife and so on if we go on searching in this spirit it will be seen that there is no exception in the society of living beings to the activity of service the politician presents his manifesto for the public to convince them of his capacity for service the voters therefore give the politician their valuable votes thinking that he will render valuable service to society the shopkeeper serves the customer and the artisan serves the capitalist the capitalist serves the family and the family serves the state in the terms of the eternal capacity of the eternal living being in this way we can see that no living being is exempt from rendering service to other living beings and therefore we can safely conclude that service is the constant companion of the living being and that the rendering of service is the eternal religion of the living being yet man professes to belong to a particular type of faith with reference to particular time and circumstance and thus claims to be a hindu muslim christian buddhist or any other sect such designations are non santanadharma a hindu may change his faith to become a muslim or a muslim may change his faith to become a hindu or a christian may change his faith and so on but in all circumstances the change of religious faith does not effect the eternal occupation of rendering service to others the hindu muslim or christian in all circumstances is servant of someone thus to profess a particular type of sect is not to profess ones santana dharma the rendering of service is santanadharma factually we are related to the supreme lord in service the supreme lord is the supreme enjoyer and we living entities are his servitors we are created for his enjoyment and if we participate in that eternal enjoyment with the supreme personality of godhead we become happy we cannot become happy otherwise it is not possible to be happy independantly just as no one part of the body can be happy without cooperating with the stomach it is not possible for the living entity to be happy without rendering transcendental loving service unto the supreme lord in the bhagavadgt worship of different demigods or rendering service to them is not approved it is stated in the seventh chapter twentieth verse kmais tais tair htajn prapadyante nyadevat ta ta niyamam sthya prakty niyat svay those whose minds are distorted by material desires surrender unto demigods and follow the particular rules and regulations of worship according to their own natures bg 720 here it is plainly said that those who are directed by lust worship the demigods and not the supreme lord ka when we mention the name ka we do not refer to any sectarian name ka means the highest pleasure and it is confirmed that the supreme lord is the reservoir or storehouse of all pleasure we are all hankering after pleasure nandamayo bhyst vs 1112 the living entities like the lord are full of consciousness and they are after happiness the lord is perpetually happy and if the living entities associate with the lord cooperate with him and take part in his association then they also become happy the lord descends to this mortal world to show his pastimes in vndvana which are full of happiness when lord r ka was in vndvana his activities with his cowherd boy friends with his damsel friends with the inhabitants of vndvana and with the cows were all full of happiness the total population of vndvana knew nothing but ka but lord ka even discouraged his father nanda mahrja from worshiping the demigod indra because he wanted to establish the fact that people need not worship any demigod they need only worship the supreme lord because their ultimate goal is to return to his abode the abode of lord r ka is described in the bhagavadgt fifteenth chapter sixth verse na tad bhsayate sryo na ako na pvaka yad gatv na nivartante tad dhma parama mama that abode of mine is not illumined by the sun or moon nor by electricity and anyone who reaches it never comes back to this material world bg 156 this verse gives a description of that eternal sky of course we have a material conception of the sky and we think of it in relationship to the sun moon stars and so on but in this verse the lord states that in the eternal sky there is no need for the sun nor for the moon nor fire of any kind because the spiritual sky is already illuminated by the brahmajyoti the rays emanating from the supreme lord we are trying with difficulty to reach other planets but it is not difficult to understand the abode of the supreme lord this abode is referred to as goloka in the brahmasahit it is beautifully described goloka eva nivasaty akhiltmabhta the lord resides eternally in his abode goloka yet he can be approached from this world and to this end the lord comes to manifest his real form saccidnandavigraha when he manifests this form there is no need for our imagining what he looks like to discourage such imaginative speculation he descends and exhibits himself as he is as ymasundara unfortunately the less intelligent deride him because he comes as one of us and plays with us as a human being but because of this we should not consider that the lord is one of us it is by his potency that he presents himself in his real form before us and displays his pastimes which are prototypes of those pastimes found in his abode in the effulgent rays of the spiritual sky there are innumerable planets floating the brahmajyoti emanates from the supreme abode kaloka and the nandamayacinmaya planets which are not material float in those rays the lord says na tad bhsayate sryo na ako na pvaka yad gatv na nivartante tad dhma parama mama one who can approach that spiritual sky is not required to descend again to the material sky in the material sky even if we approach the highest planet brahmaloka what to speak of the moon we will find the same conditions of life namely birth death disease and old age no planet in the material universe is free from these four principles of material existence therefore the lord says in bhagavadgt brahmabhuvanl lok punar vartino rjuna the living entities are traveling from one planet to another not by mechanical arrangement but by a spiritual process this is also mentioned ynti devavrat devn pitn ynti pitvrat no mechanical arrangement is necessary if we want interplanetary travel the gt instructs ynti devavrat devn the moon the sun and higher planets are called svargaloka there are three different statuses of planets higher middle and lower planetary systems the earth belongs to the middle planetary system bhagavadgt informs us how to travel to the higher planetary systems devaloka with a very simple formula ynti devavrat devn one need only worship the particular demigod of that particular planet and in that way go to the moon the sun or any of the higher planetary systems yet bhagavadgt does not advise us to go to any of the planets in this material world because even if we go to brahmaloka the highest planet through some sort of mechanical contrivance by maybe traveling for forty thousand years and who would live that long we will still find the material inconveniences of birth death disease and old age but one who wants to approach the supreme planet kaloka or any of the other planets within the spiritual sky will not meet with these material inconveniences amongst all of the planets in the spiritual sky there is one supreme planet called goloka vndvana which is the original planet in the abode of the original personality of godhead r ka all of this information is given in bhagavadgt and we are given through its instruction information how to leave the material world and begin a truly blissful life in the spiritual sky in the fifteenth chapter of the bhagavadgt the real picture of the material world is given it is said there rdhvamlam adhakham avattha prhur avyayam chandsi yasya parni yas ta veda sa vedavit the supreme lord said there is a banyan tree which has its roots upward and its branches down and the vedic hymns are its leaves one who knows this tree is the knower of the vedas bg 151 here the material world is described as a tree whose roots are upwards and branches are below we have experience of a tree whose roots are upward if one stands on the bank of a river or any reservoir of water he can see that the trees reflected in the water are upside down the branches go downward and the roots upward similarly this material world is a reflection of the spiritual world the material world is but a shadow of reality in the shadow there is no reality or substantiality but from the shadow we can understand that there is substance and reality in the desert there is no water but the mirage suggests that there is such a thing as water in the material world there is no water there is no happiness but the real water of actual happiness is there in the spiritual world the lord suggests that we attain the spiritual world in the following manner nirmnamoh jitasagado adhytmanity vinivttakm dvandvair vimukt sukhadukhasajair gacchanty amh padam avyaya tat that padam avyayam or eternal kingdom can be reached by one who is nirmnamoha what does this mean we are after designations someone wants to become a son someone wants to become lord someone wants to become the president or a rich man or a king or something else as long as we are attached to these designations we are attached to the body because designations belong to the body but we are not these bodies and realizing this is the first stage in spiritual realization we are associated with the three modes of material nature but we must become detached through devotional service to the lord if we are not attached to devotional service to the lord then we cannot become detached from the modes of material nature designations and attachments are due to our lust and desire our wanting to lord it over the material nature as long as we do not give up this propensity of lording it over material nature there is no possibility of returning to the kingdom of the supreme the santanadhma that eternal kingdom which is never destroyed can be approached by one who is not bewildered by the attractions of false material enjoyments who is situated in the service of the supreme lord one so situated can easily approach that supreme abode elsewhere in the gt it is stated avyakto kara ity uktas tam hu param gatim ya prpya na nivartante tad dhma parama mama avyakta means unmanifested not even all of the material world is manifested before us our senses are so imperfect that we cannot even see all of the stars within this material universe in vedic literature we can receive much information about all the planets and we can believe it or not believe it all of the important planets are described in vedic literatures especially rmadbhgavatam and the spiritual world which is beyond this material sky is described as avyakta unmanifested one should desire and hanker after that supreme kingdom for when one attains that kingdom he does not have to return to this material world next one may raise the question of how one goes about approaching that abode of the supreme lord information of this is given in the eighth chapter it is said there antakle ca mm eva smaran muktv kalevaram ya prayti sa madbhvam yti nsty atra saaya anyone who quits his body at the end of life remembering me attains immediately to my nature and there is no doubt of this bg 85 one who thinks of ka at the time of his death goes to ka one must remember the form of ka if he quits his body thinking of this form he approaches the spiritual kingdom madbhva refers to the supreme nature of the supreme being the supreme being is saccidnanda vigrahaeternal full of knowledge and bliss our present body is not saccidnanda it is asat not sat it is not eternal it is perishable it is not cit full of knowledge but it is full of ignorance we have no knowledge of the spiritual kingdom nor do we even have perfect knowledge of this material world where there are so many things unknown to us the body is also nirnanda instead of being full of bliss it is full of misery all of the miseries we experience in the material world arise from the body but one who leaves this body thinking of the supreme personality of godhead at once attains a saccidnanda body as is promised in this fifth verse of the eighth chapter where lord ka says he attains my nature the process of quitting this body and getting another body in the material world is also organized a man dies after it has been decided what form of body he will have in the next life higher authorities not the living entity himself make this decision according to our activities in this life we either rise or sink this life is a preparation for the next life if we can prepare therefore in this life to get promotion to the kingdom of god then surely after quitting this material body we will attain a spiritual body just like the lord as explained before there are different kinds of transcendentalists the brahmavdi paramtmvdi and the devotee and as mentioned in the brahmajyoti spiritual sky there are innumerable spiritual planets the number of these planets is far far greater than all of the planets of this material world this material world has been approximated as only one quarter of the creation in this material segment there are millions and billions of universes with trillions of planets and suns stars and moons but this whole material creation is only a fragment of the total creation most of the creation is in the spiritual sky one who desires to merge into the existence of the supreme brahman is at once transferred to the brahmajyoti of the supreme lord and thus attains the spiritual sky the devotee who wants to enjoy the association of the lord enters into the vaikuha planets which are innumerable and the supreme lord by his plenary expansions as nryaa with four hands and with different names like pradyumna aniruddha govinda etc associates with him there therefore at the end of life the transcendentalists either think of the brahmajyoti the paramtm or the supreme personality of godhead r ka in all cases they enter into the spiritual sky but only the devotee or he who is in personal touch with the supreme lord enters into the vaikuha planets the lord further adds that of this there is no doubt this must be believed firmly we should not reject that which does not tally with our imagination our attitude should be that of arjuna i believe everything that you have said therefore when the lord says that at the time of death whoever thinks of him as brahman or paramtm or as the personality of godhead certainly enters into the spiritual sky there is no doubt about it there is no question of disbelieving it the information on how to think of the supreme being at the time of death is also given in the gt ya ya vpi smaran bhva tyajaty ante kalevaram ta tam evaiti kaunteya sad tadbhvabhvita in whatever condition one quits his present body in his next life he will attain to that state of being without fail bg 86 material nature is a display of one of the energies of the supreme lord in the viu pura the total energies of the supreme lord as viuakti par prokt etc are delineated the supreme lord has diverse and innumerable energies which are beyond our conception however great learned sages or liberated souls have studied these energies and have analyzed them into three parts all of the energies are of viuakti that is to say they are different potencies of lord viu that energy is par transcendental living entities also belong to the superior energy as has already been explained the other energies or material energies are in the mode of ignorance at the time of death we can either remain in the inferior energy of this material world or we can transfer to the energy of the spiritual world in life we are accustomed to thinking either of the material or the spiritual energy there are so many literatures which fill our thoughts with the material energynewspapers novels etc our thinking which is now absorbed in these literatures must be transferred to the vedic literatures the great sages therefore have written so many vedic literatures such as the puras etc the puras are not imaginative they are historical records in the caitanyacaritmita there is the following verse my mugdha jiver nhi svata kajn jivera kpya kail ka vedapura cc madhya 20122 the forgetful living entities or conditioned souls have forgotten their relationship with the supreme lord and they are engrossed in thinking of material activities just to transfer their thinking power to the spiritual sky ka has given a great number of vedic literatures first he divided the vedas into four then he explained them in the puras and for less capable people he wrote the mahbhrata in the mahbhrata there is given the bhagavadgt then all vedic literature is summarized in the vedntastra and for future guidance he gave a natural commentation on the vedntasutra called rmadbhgavatam we must always engage our minds in reading these vedic literatures just as materialists engage their minds in reading newspapers magazines and so many materialistic literatures we must transfer our reading to these literatures which are given to us by vysadeva in that way it will be possible for us to remember the supreme lord at the time of death that is the only way suggested by the lord and he guarantees the result there is no doubt bg 87 tasmt sarveu kleu mm anusmara yudhya ca mayy arpitamanobuddhir mm evaiyasy asaaya therefore arjuna you should always think of me and at the same time you should continue your prescribed duty and fight with your mind and activities always fixed on me and everything engaged in me you will attain to me without any doubt he does not advise arjuna to simply remember him and give up his occupation no the lord never suggests anything impractical in this material world in order to maintain the body one has to work human society is divided according to work into four divisions of social order brhmaa katriya vaiya dra the brhmaa class or intelligent class is working in one way the katriya or administrative class is working in another way and the mercantile class and the laborers are all tending to their specific duties in the human society whether one is a laborer merchant warrior administrator or farmer or even if one belongs to the highest class and is a literary man a scientist or a theologian he has to work in order to maintain his existence the lord therefore tells arjuna that he need not give up his occupation but while he is engaged in his occupation he should remember ka if he doesnt practice remembering ka while he is struggling for existence then it will not be possible for him to remember ka at the time of death lord caitanya also advises this he says that one should practice remembering the lord by chanting the names of the lord always the names of the lord and the lord are nondifferent so lord kas instruction to arjuna to remember me and lord caitanyas injunction to always chant the names of lord ka are the same instruction there is no difference because ka and kas name are nondifferent in the absolute status there is no difference between reference and referent therefore we have to practice remembering the lord always twentyfour hours a day by chanting his names and molding our lifes activities in such a way that we can remember him always how is this possible the cryas give the following example if a married woman is attached to another man or if a man has an attachment for a woman other than his wife then the attachment is to be considered very strong one with such an attachment is always thinking of the loved one the wife who is thinking of her lover is always thinking of meeting him even while she is carrying out her household chores in fact she carries out her household work even more carefully so her husband will not suspect her attachment similarly we should always remember the supreme lover r ka and at the same time perform our material duties very nicely a strong sense of love is required here if we have a strong sense of love for the supreme lord then we can discharge our duty and at the same time remember him but we have to develop that sense of love arjuna for instance was always thinking of ka he was the constant companion of ka and at the same time he was a warrior ka did not advise him to give up fighting and go to the forest to meditate when lord ka delineates the yoga system to arjuna arjuna says that the practice of this system is not possible for him arjuna uvca yo ya yogas tvay prokta smyena madhusdana etasyha na paymi cacalatvt sthiti sthirm arjuna said o madhusdana the system of yoga which you have summarized appears impractical and unendurable to me for the mind is restless and unsteady bg 633 but the lord says yoginm api sarve madgatenntartman raddhvn bhajate yo m sa me yuktatamo mata of all yogs he who always abides in me with great faith worshiping me in transcendental loving service is most intimately united with me in yoga and is the highest of all bg 647 so one who thinks of the supreme lord always is the greatest yog the supermost jn and the greatest devotee at the same time the lord further tells arjuna that as a katriya he cannot give up his fighting but if arjuna fights remembering ka then he will be able to remember him at the time of death but one must be completely surrendered in the transcendental loving service of the lord we work not with our body actually but with our mind and intelligence so if the intelligence and the mind are always engaged in the thought of the supreme lord then naturally the senses are also engaged in his service superficially at least the activities of the senses remain the same but the consciousness is changed the bhagavadgt teaches one how to absorb the mind and intelligence in the thought of the lord such absorption will enable one to transfer himself to the kingdom of the lord if the mind is engaged in kas service then the senses are automatically engaged in his service this is the art and this is also the secret of bhagavadgt total absorption in the thought of r ka modern man has struggled very hard to reach the moon but he has not tried very hard to elevate himself spiritually if one has fifty years of life ahead of him he should engage that brief time in cultivating this practice of remembering the supreme personality of godhead this practice is the devotional process of ravaa krtana vio smaraa pdasevanam arcana vandana dsya sakhyam tmanivedanam these nine processes of which the easiest is ravaa hearing bhagavadgt from the realized person will turn one to the thought of the supreme being this will lead to nicala remembering the supreme lord and will enable one upon leaving the body to attain a spiritual body which is just fit for association with the supreme lord the lord further says abhysayogayuktena cetas nnyagmin parama purua divya yti prthnucintayan by practicing this remembering without being deviated thinking ever of the supreme godhead one is sure to achieve the planet of the divine the supreme personality o son of kunt bg 88 this is not a very difficult process however one must learn it from an experienced person from one who is already in the practice the mind is always flying to this and that but one must always practice concentrating the mind on the form of the supreme lord r ka or on the sound of his name the mind is naturally restless going hither and thither but it can rest in the sound vibration of ka one must thus meditate on parama purua the supreme person and thus attain him the ways and the means for ultimate realization ultimate attainment are stated in the bhagavadgt and the doors of this knowledge are open for everyone no one is barred out all classes of men can approach the lord by thinking of him for hearing and thinking of him is possible for everyone the lord further says m hi prtha vyapritya ye pi syu ppayonaya striyo vaiys tath drs te pi ynti par gatim ki punar brhma puy bhakt rjarayas tath anityam asukha lokam ima prpya bhajasva mm o son of pth anyone who will take shelter in me whether a woman or a merchant or one born in a low family can yet approach the supreme destination how much greater then are the brhmaas the righteous the devotees and saintly kings in this miserable world these are fixed in devotional service to the lord bg 93233 human beings even in the lower statuses of life a merchant a woman or a laborer can attain the supreme one does not need highly developed intelligence the point is that anyone who accepts the principle of bhaktiyoga and accepts the supreme lord as the summum bonum of life as the highest target the ultimate goal can approach the lord in the spiritual sky if one adopts the principles enunciated in bhagavadgt he can make his life perfect and make a perfect solution to all the problems of life which arise out of the transient nature of material existence this is the sum and substance of the entire bhagavadgt in conclusion bhagavadgta is a transcendental literature which one should read very carefully it is capable of saving one from all fear nehbhikramano sti pratyavyo na vidyate svalpam apy asya dharmasya tryate mahato bhayt in this endeavor there is no loss or diminution and a little advancement on this path can protect one from the most dangerous type of fear bg 240 if one reads bhagavadgt sincerely and seriously then all of the reactions of his past misdeeds will not react upon him in the last portion of bhagavadgt lord r ka proclaims sarvadharmn parityajya mm eka araa vraja aha tv sarvappebhyo mokayiymi m uca give up all varieties of religiousness and just surrender unto me and in return i shall protect you from all sinful reactions therefore you have nothing to fear bg 1866 thus the lord takes all responsibility for one who surrenders unto him and he indemnifies all the reactions of sin one cleanses himself daily by taking a bath in water but one who takes his bath only once in the sacred ganges water of the bhagavadgt cleanses away all the dirt of material life because bhagavadgt is spoken by the supreme personality of godhead one need not read any other vedic literature one need only attentively and regularly hear and read bhagavadgt in the present age mankind is so absorbed with mundane activities that it is not possible to read all of the vedic literatures but this is not necessary this one book bhagavadgt will suffice because it is the essence of all vedic literatures and because it is spoken by the supreme personality of godhead it is said that one who drinks the water of the ganges certainly gets salvation but what to speak of one who drinks the waters of bhagavadgt gt is the very nectar of the mahbhrata spoken by viu himself for lord ka is the original viu it is nectar emanating from the mouth of the supreme personality of godhead and the ganges is said to be emanating from the lotus feet of the lord of course there is no difference between the mouth and the feet of the supreme lord but in our position we can appreciate that the bhagavadgt is even more important than the ganges the bhagavadgt is just like a cow and lord ka who is a cowherd boy is milking this cow the milk is the essence of the vedas and arjuna is just like a calf the wise men the great sages and pure devotees are to drink the nectarean milk of bhagavadgt in this present day man is very eager to have one scripture one god one religion and one occupation so let there be one common scripture for the whole worldbhagavadgt and let there be one god only for the whole worldr ka and one mantra onlyhare ka hare ka ka ka hare hare hare rma hare rma

pilgrimage at kuruketra what did my sons and the sons of pu do being desirous to fight purport bhagavadgt is the widely read theistic science summarized in the gtmhtmya glorification of the gt there it says that one should read bhagavadgt very scrutinizingly with the help of a person who is a devotee of r ka and try to understand it without personally motivated interpretations the example of clear understanding is there in the bhagavadgt itself in the way the teaching is understood by arjuna who heard the gt directly from the lord if someone is fortunate enough to understand bhagavadgt in that line of disciplic succession without motivated interpretation then he surpasses all studies of vedic wisdom and all scriptures of the world one will find in the bhagavadgt all that is contained in other scriptures but the reader will also find things which are not to be found elsewhere that is the specific standard of the gt it is the perfect theistic science because it is directly spoken by the supreme personality of godhead lord r ka the topics discussed by dhtarra and sajaya as described in the mahbhrata form the basic principle for this great philosophy it is understood that this philosophy evolved on the battlefield of kuruketra which is a sacred place of pilgrimage from the immemorial time of the vedic age it was spoken by the lord when he was present personally on this planet for the guidance of mankind the word dharmaketra a place where religious rituals are performed is significant because on the battlefield of kuruketra the supreme personality of godhead was present on the side of arjuna dhtarra the father of the kurus was highly doubtful about the possibility of his sons ultimate victory in his doubt he inquired from his secretary sajaya what did my sons and the sons of pu do he was confident that both his sons and the sons of his younger brother pu were assembled in that field of kuruketra for a determined engagement of the war still his inquiry is significant he did not want a compromise between the cousins and brothers and he wanted to be sure of the fate of his sons on the battlefield because the battle was arranged to be fought at kuruketra which is mentioned elsewhere in the vedas as a place of worshipeven for the denizens of heavendhtarra became very fearful about the influence of the holy place on the outcome of the battle he knew very well that this would influence arjuna and the sons of pu favorably because by nature they were all virtuous sajaya was a student of vysa and therefore by the mercy of vysa sajaya was able to envision the battlefield of kuruketra even while he was in the room of dhtarra and so dhtarra asked him about the situation on the battlefield both the pavas and the sons of dhtarra belong to the same family but dhtarras mind is disclosed herein he deliberately claimed only his sons as kurus and he separated the sons of pu from the family heritage one can thus understand the specific position of dhtarra in his relationship with his nephews the sons of pu as in the paddy field the unnecessary plants are taken out so it is expected from the very beginning of these topics that in the religious field of kuruketra where the father of religion r ka was present the unwanted plants like dhtarras son duryodhana and others would be wiped out and the thoroughly religious persons headed by yudhihira would be established by the lord this is the significance of the words dharmaketre and kuru ketre apart from their historical and vedic importance text 2 sajaya uvca dv tu pavnka vyha duryodhanas tad

began to speak the following words purport dhtarra was blind from birth unfortunately he was also bereft of spiritual vision he knew very well that his sons were equally blind in the matter of religion and he was sure that they could never reach an understanding with the pavas who were all pious since birth still he was doubtful about the influence of the place of pilgrimage and sajaya could understand his motive in asking about the situation on the battlefield he wanted therefore to encourage the despondent king and thus he warned him that his sons were not going to make any sort of compromise under the influence of the holy place sajaya therefore informed the king that his son duryodhana after seeing the military force of the pavas at once went to the commanderinchief drocrya to inform him of the real position although duryodhana is mentioned as the king he still had to go to the commander on account of the seriousness of the situation he was therefore quite fit to be a politician but duryodhanas diplomatic veneer could not disguise the fear he felt when he saw the military arrangement of the pavas text 3 payait puputrm crya mahat camm vyh drupadaputrea tava iyea

o my teacher behold the great army of the sons of pu so expertly arranged by your intelligent disciple the son of drupada purport duryodhana a great diplomat wanted to point out the defects of drocrya the great brhmaa commanderinchief drocrya had some political quarrel with king drupada the father of draupad who was arjunas wife as a result of this quarrel drupada performed a great sacrifice by which he received the benediction of having a son who would be able to kill drocrya drocrya knew this perfectly well and yet as a liberal brhmaa he did not hesitate to impart all his military secrets when the son of drupada dhadyumna was entrusted to him for military education now on the battlefield of kuruketra dhadyumna took the side of the pavas and it was he who arranged for their military phalanx after having learned the art from drocrya duryodhana pointed out this mistake of drocryas so that he might be alert and uncompromising in the fighting by this he wanted to point out also that he should not be similarly lenient in battle against the pavas who were also drocryas affectionate students arjuna especially was his most affectionate and brilliant student duryodhana also warned that such leniency in the fight would lead to defeat text 4 atra r mahevs bhmrjunasam yudhi yuyudhno vira ca drupada ca mahratha atrahere rheroes mahevsmighty bowmen bhmaarjuna bhma and arjuna

there are also great fighters like yuyudhna vira and drupada purport even though dhadyumna was not a very important obstacle in the face of drocryas very great power in the military art there were many others who were the cause of fear they are mentioned by duryodhana as great stumbling blocks on the path of victory because each and every one of them was as formidable as bhma and arjuna he knew

in other words it is already concluded that all of them would die in the battle of kuruketra for joining the party of the sinful duryodhana duryodhana was of course confident of his victory on account of the abovementioned combined strength of his friends text 10 aparypta tad asmka bala bhmbhirakitam parypta tv idam ete bala bhmbhirakitam aparyptamimmeasurable tatthat asmkamof ours balam strength

immeasurable and we are perfectly protected by grandfather bhma whereas the strength of the pavas carefully protected by bhma is limited purport herein an estimation of comparative strength is made by duryodhana he thinks that the strength of his armed forces is immeasurable being specifically protected by the most experienced general grandfather bhma on the other hand the forces of the pavas are limited being protected by a less experienced general bhma who is like a fig in the presence of bhma duryodhana was always envious of bhma because he knew perfectly well that if he should die at all he would only be killed by bhma but at the same time he was confident of his victory on account of the presence of bhma who was a far superior general his conclusion that he would come out of the battle victorious was well ascertained text 11 ayaneu ca sarveu yathbhgam avasthit bhmam evbhirakantu bhavanta sarva eva hi ayaneuin the strategic points caalso sarveueverywhere yathbhgamas they are

you must give full support to grandfather bhma standing at your respective strategic points in the phalanx of the army purport duryodhana after praising the prowess of bhma further considered that others might think that they had been considered less important so in his usual diplomatic way he tried to adjust the situation in the above words he emphasized that bhmadeva was undoubtedly the greatest hero but he was an old man so everyone must especially think of his protection from all sides he might become engaged in the fight and the enemy might take advantage of his full engagement on one side therefore it was important that other heroes would not leave their strategic positions and allow the enemy to break the phalanx duryodhana clearly felt that the victory of the kurus depended on the presence of bhmadeva he was confident of the full support of bhmadeva and drocrya in the battle because he well knew that they did not even speak a word when arjunas wife draupad in her helpless condition had appealed to them for justice while she was being forced to strip naked in the presence of all the great generals in the assembly although he knew that the two generals had some sort of affection for the pavas he hoped that all such affection would now be completely given up by them as was customary during the gambling performances text 12 tasya sajanayan hara kuruvddha

his natural compassion for him he tried to cheer him by blowing his conchshell very loudly befitting his position as a lion indirectly by the symbolism of the conchshell he informed his depressed grandson duryodhana that he had no chance of victory in the battle because the supreme lord ka was on the other side but still it was his duty to conduct the fight and no pains would be spared in that connection text 13 tata akh ca bherya ca paavnakagomukh sahasaivbhyahanyanta sa abdas tumulo bhavat tatathereafter akhconchshells caalso bheryabugles ca and paavanakatrumpets and drums gomukhhorns

transcendental akhauconchshells pradadhmatusounded translation on the other side both lord ka and arjuna stationed on a great chariot drawn by white horses sounded their transcendental conchshells purport in contrast with the conchshell blown by bhmadeva the conchshells in the hands of ka and arjuna are described as transcendental the sounding of the transcendental conchshells indicated that there was no hope of victory for the other side because ka was on the side of the pavas jayas tu puputr ye pake janrdana victory is always with persons like the sons of pu because lord ka is associated with them and whenever and wherever the lord is present the goddess of fortune is also there because the goddess of fortune never lives alone without her husband therefore victory and fortune were awaiting arjuna as indicated by the transcendental sound produced by the conchshell of viu or lord ka besides that the chariot on which both the friends were seated was donated by agni the firegod to arjuna and this indicated that this chariot was capable of conquering all sides wherever it was drawn over the three worlds text 15 pcajanya hkeo devadatta dhanajaya paura dadhmau

winner of wealth pauramthe conch named pauram dadhmau blew mahakhamthe terrific conchshell bhmakarmone who performs herculean tasks vkodarathe voracious eater bhma translation then lord ka blew his conchshell called pcajanya arjuna blew his the devadatta and bhma the voracious eater and performer of herculean tasks blew his terrific conchshell called pauram purport lord ka is referred to as hkea in this verse because he is the owner of all senses the living entities are part and parcel of him and therefore the senses of the living entities are also part and parcel of his senses the impersonalists cannot account for the senses of the living entities and therefore they are always anxious to describe all living entities as senseless or impersonal the lord situated in the hearts of all living entities directs their senses but he directs in terms of the surrender of the living entity and in the case of a pure devotee he directly controls the senses here on the battlefield of kuruketra the lord directly controls the transcendental senses of arjuna and thus his particular name of hkea the lord has different names according to his different activities for example his name is madhusdana because he killed the demon of the name madhu his name is govinda because he gives pleasure to the cows and to the senses his name is vsudeva because he appeared as the son of vasudeva his name is devaknandana because he accepted devak as his mother his name is yaodnandana because he awarded his childhood pastimes to yaod at vndvana his name is prthasrathi because he worked as charioteer of his friend arjuna similarly his name is hkea because he gave direction to arjuna on the battlefield of kuruketra arjuna is referred to as dhanajaya in this verse because he helped his elder brother in fetching wealth when it was required by the king to make expenditures for different sacrifices similarly bhma is known as vkodara because he could eat as voraciously as he could perform herculean tasks such as killing the demon hiimba so the particular types of conchshell blown by the different personalities on the side of the pavas beginning with the lords were all very encouraging to the fighting soldiers on the other side there were no such credits nor the presence of lord ka the supreme director nor that of the goddess of fortune so they were predestined to lose the battleand that was the message announced by the sounds of the conchshells texts 1618 anantavijaya rj kuntputro yudhihira nakula sahadeva ca sughoamaipupakau kya ca paramevsa ikha ca mahratha

subhadr greatly armed all blew their respective conchshells purport sajaya informed king dhtarra very tactfully that his unwise policy of deceiving the sons of pu and endeavoring to enthrone his own sons on the seat of the kingdom was not very laudable the signs already clearly indicated that the whole kuru dynasty would be killed in that great battle beginning with the grandsire bhma down to the grandsons like abhimanyu and othersincluding kings from many states of the world all were present there and all were doomed the whole catastrophe was due to king dhtarra because he encouraged the policy followed by his sons text 19 sa ghoo dhrtarr hdayni vyadrayat nabha ca pthiv caiva tumulo bhyanundayan sathat ghoavibration dhrtarrmof the sons of dhtarra hdaynihearts vyadrayatshattered

vibrating both in the sky and on the earth it shattered the hearts of the sons of dhtarra purport when bhma and the others on the side of duryodhana blew their respective conchshells there was no heartbreaking on the part of the pavas such occurrences are not mentioned but in this particular verse it is mentioned that the hearts of the sons of dhtarra were shattered by the sounds vibrated by the pavas party this is due to the pavas and their confidence in lord ka one who takes shelter of the supreme lord has nothing to fear even in the midst of the greatest calamity text 20 atha

at the sons of dhtarra o king arjuna then spoke to hkea ka these words purport the battle was just about to begin it is understood from the above statement that the sons of dhtarra were more or less disheartened by the unexpected arrangement of military force by the pavas who were guided by the direct instructions of lord ka on the battlefield the emblem of hanumn on the flag of arjuna is another sign of victory because hanumn cooperated with lord rma in the battle between rma and rvaa and lord rma emerged victorious now both rma and hanumn were present on the chariot of arjuna to help him lord ka is rma himself and wherever lord rma is his eternal servitor hanumn and his eternal consort st the goddess of fortune are present therefore arjuna had no cause to fear any enemies whatsoever and above all the lord of the senses lord ka was personally present to give him direction thus all good counsel was available to arjuna in the matter of executing the battle in such auspicious conditions arranged by the lord for his eternal devotee lay the signs of assured victory texts 2122 arjuna uvca senayor ubhayor madhye ratha sthpaya me cyuta yvad etn nirke ha yoddhukmn avasthitn kair

contend in this great battle attempt purport although lord ka is the supreme personality of godhead out of his causeless mercy he was engaged in the service of his friend he never fails in his affection for his devotees and thus he is addressed herein as infallible as charioteer he had to carry out the orders of arjuna and since he did not hesitate to do so he is addressed as infallible although he had accepted the position of a charioteer for his devotee his supreme position was not challenged in all circumstances he is the supreme personality of godhead hkea the lord of the total senses the relationship between the lord and his servitor is very sweet and transcendental the servitor is always ready to render a service to the lord and similarly the lord is always seeking an opportunity to render some service to the devotee he takes greater pleasure in his pure devotees assuming the advantageous postion of ordering him than he does in being the giver of orders as master everyone is under his orders and no one is above him to order him but when he finds that a pure devotee is ordering him he obtains transcendental pleasure although he is the infallible master of all circumstances as a pure devotee of the lord arjuna had no desire to fight with his cousins and brothers but he was forced to come onto the battlefield by the obstinacy of duryodhana who was never agreeable to any peaceful negotiation therefore he was very anxious to see who the leading persons present on the battlefield were although there was no question of a peacemaking endeavor on the battlefield he wanted to see them again and to see how much they were bent upon demanding an unwanted war text 23 yotsyamnn aveke ha ya ete tra samgat dhrtarrasya durbuddher yuddhe priyacikrava

translation let me see those who have come here to fight wishing to please the evilminded son of dhtarra purport it was an open secret that duryodhana wanted to usurp the kingdom of the pavas by evil plans in collaboration with his father dhtarra therefore all persons who had joined the side of duryodhana must have been birds of the same feather arjuna wanted to see them in the battlefield before the fight was begun just to learn who they were but he had no intention of proposing peace negotiations with them it was also a fact that he wanted to see them to make an estimate of the strength which he had to face although he was quite confident of victory because ka was sitting by his side text 24 sajaya uvca evam ukto hkeo gukeena bhrata senayor ubhayor madhye sthpayitv rathottamam

referred to as gukea guka means sleep and one who conquers sleep is called gukea sleep also means ignorance so arjuna conquered both sleep and ignorance because of his friendship with ka as a great devotee of ka he could not forget ka even for a moment because that is the nature of a devotee either in waking or in sleep a devotee of the lord can never be free from thinking of kas name form quality and pastimes thus a devotee of ka can conquer both sleep and ignorance simply by thinking of ka constantly this is called ka consciousness or samdhi as hkea or the director of the senses and mind of every living entity ka could understand arjunas purpose in placing the chariot in the midst of the armies thus he did so and spoke as follows text 25 bhmadroapramukhata sarve ca mahkitm uvca

kurus who are assembled here purport as the supersoul of all living entities lord ka could understand what was going on in the mind of arjuna the use of the word hkea in this connection indicates that he knew everything and the word prtha or the son of kunt or pth is also similarly significant in reference to arjuna as a friend he wanted to inform arjuna that because arjuna was the son of pth the sister of his own father vasudeva he had agreed to be the charioteer of arjuna now what did ka mean when he told arjuna to behold the kurus did arjuna want to stop there and not fight ka never expected such things from the son of his aunt pth the mind of arjuna was thus predicated by the lord in friendly joking text 26 tatrpayat sthitn prtha pitn atha pitmahn cryn mtuln bhrtn putrn pautrn

seeing my friends and relatives present before me in such a fighting spirit i feel the limbs of my body quivering and my mouth drying up purport any man who has genuine devotion to the lord has all the good qualities which are found in godly persons or in the demigods whereas the nondevotee however advanced he may be in material qualifications by education and culture lacks in godly qualities as such arjuna just after seeing his kinsmen friends and relatives on the battlefield was at once overwhelmed by compassion for them who had so decided to fight amongst themselves as far as his soldiers were concerned he was sympathetic from the beginning but he felt compassion even for the soldiers of the opposite party foreseeing their imminent death and so thinking the limbs of his body began to quiver and his mouth became dry he was more or less astonished to see their fighting spirit practically the whole community all blood relatives of arjuna had come to fight with him this overwhelmed a kind devotee like arjuna although it is not mentioned here still one can easily imagine that not only were arjunas bodily limbs quivering and his mouth drying up but that he was also crying out of compassion such symptoms in arjuna were not due to weakness but to his softheartedness a characteristic of a pure devotee of the lord it is said therefore yasysti bhaktir bhagavaty akican sarvair guais tatra samsate sur harv abhaktasya kuto mahadgu manorathensati dhvato bahi one who has unflinching devotion for the personality of godhead has all the good qualities of the demigods but one who is not a devotee of the lord has only material qualifications that are of little value this is because he is hovering on the mental plane and is certain to be attracted by the glaring material energy

gva is slipping from my hand and my skin is burning purport there are two kinds of trembling of the body and two kinds of standings of the hair on end such phenomena occur either in great spiritual ecstasy or out of great fear under material conditions there is no fear in transcendental realization arjunas symptoms in this situation are out of material fearnamely loss of life this is evident from other symptoms also he became so impatient that his famous bow gva was slipping from his hands and because his heart was burning within him he was feeling a burning sensation of the skin all these are due to a material conception of life text 30 na ca aknomy avasthtu bhramatva ca me mana nimittni ca paymi vipartni keava nanor caalso aknomiam i able avasthtumto stay bhramati forgetting

and my mind is reeling i foresee only evil o killer of the ke demon purport due to his impatience arjuna was unable to stay on the battlefield and he was forgetting himself on account of the weakness of his mind excessive attachment for material things puts a man in a bewildering condition of existence bhaya dvitybhiniveata such fearfulness and loss of mental equilibrium take place in persons who are too affected by material conditions arjuna envisioned only unhappiness in the battlefield he would not be happy even by gaining victory over the foe the word nimitta is significant when a man sees only frustration in his expectations he thinks why am i here everyone is interested in himself and his own welfare no one is interested in the supreme self arjuna is supposed to show disregard for selfinterest by submission to the will of ka who is everyones real selfinterest the conditioned soul forgets this and therefore suffers material pains arjuna thought that his victory in the battle would only be a cause of lamentation for him text 31 na ca reyo nupaymi hatv svajanam have na kke vijaya ka na ca rjya sukhni ca nanor caalso reyagood anupaymido i foresee hatvby killing svajanamown

in this battle nor can i my dear ka desire any subsequent victory kingdom or happiness purport without knowing that ones selfinterest is in viu or ka conditioned souls are attracted by bodily relationships hoping to be happy in such situations under delusion they forget that ka is also the cause of material happiness arjuna appears to have even forgotten the moral codes for a katriya it is said that two kinds of men namely the katriya who dies directly in front of the battlefield under kas personal orders and the person in the renounced order of life who is absolutely devoted to spiritual culture are eligible to enter into the sunglobe which is so powerful and dazzling arjuna is reluctant even to kill his enemies let alone his relatives he thought that by killing his kinsmen there would be no happiness in his life and therefore he was not willing to fight just as a person who does not feel hunger is not inclined to cook he has now decided to go into the forest and live a secluded life in frustration but as a katriya he requires a kingdom for his subsistence because the katriyas cannot engage themselves in any other occupation but arjuna has had no kingdom arjunas sole opportunity for gaining a kingdom lay in fighting with his cousins and brothers and reclaiming the kingdom inherited from his father which he does not like to do therefore he considers himself fit to go to the forest to live a secluded life of frustration texts 3235 ki no rjyena govinda ki bhogair jvitena v yem arthe kkita no rjya bhog sukhni ca ta ime vasthit yuddhe prs tyaktv dhanni ca cry

all relatives are ready to give up their lives and properties and are standing before me then why should i wish to kill them though i may survive o maintainer of all creatures i am not prepared to fight with them even in exchange for the three worlds let alone this earth purport arjuna has addressed lord ka as govinda because ka is the object of all pleasures for cows and the senses by using this significant word arjuna indicates what will satisfy his senses although govinda is not meant for satisfying our senses if we try to satisfy the senses of govinda then automatically our own senses are satisfied materially everyone wants to satisfy his senses and he wants god to be the order supplier for such satisfaction the lord will satisfy the senses of the living entities as much as they deserve but not to the extent that they may covet but when one takes the opposite waynamely when one tries to satisfy the senses of govinda without desiring to satisfy ones own sensesthen by the grace of govinda all desires of the living entity are satisfied arjunas deep affection for community and family members is exhibited here partly due to his natural compassion for them he is therefore not prepared to fight everyone wants to show his opulence to friends and relatives but arjuna fears that all his relatives and friends will be killed in the battlefield and he will be unable to share his opulence after victory this is a typical calculation of material life the transcendental life is however different since a devotee wants to satisfy the desires of the lord he can lord willing accept all kinds of opulence for the service of the lord and if the lord is not willing he should not accept a farthing arjuna did not want to kill his relatives and if there were any need to kill them he desired that ka kill them personally at this point he did not know that ka had already killed them before their coming into the battlefield and that he was only to become an instrument for ka this fact is disclosed in following chapters as a natural devotee of the lord arjuna did not like to retaliate against his miscreant cousins and brothers but it was the lords plan that they should all be killed the devotee of the lord does not retaliate against the wrongdoer but the lord does not tolerate any mischief done to the devotee by the miscreants the lord can excuse a person on his own account but he excuses no one who has done harm to his devotees therefore the lord was determined to kill the miscreants although arjuna wanted to excuse them text 36 ppam evrayed asmn hatvaitn

husband of the goddess of fortune translation sin will overcome us if we slay such aggressors therefore it is not proper for us to kill the sons of dhtarra and our friends what should we gain o ka husband of the goddess of fortune and how could we be happy by killing our own kinsmen purport according to vedic injunctions there are six kinds of aggressors 1 a poison giver 2 one who sets fire to the house 3 one who attacks with deadly weapons 4 one who plunders riches 5 one who occupies anothers land and 6 one who kidnaps a wife such aggressors are at once to be killed and no sin is incurred by killing such aggressors such killing of aggressors is quite befitting for any ordinary man but arjuna was not an ordinary person he was saintly by character and therefore he wanted to deal with them in saintliness this kind of saintliness however is not for a katriya although a responsible man in the administration of a state is required to be saintly he should not be cowardly for example lord rma was so saintly that people were anxious to live in his kingdom rmarjya but lord rma never showed any cowardice rvaa was an aggressor against rma because he kidnapped rmas wife st but lord rma gave him sufficient lessons unparalleled in the history of the world in arjunas case however one should consider the special type of aggressors namely his own grandfather own teacher friends sons grandsons etc because of them arjuna thought that he should not take the severe steps necessary against ordinary aggressors besides that saintly persons are advised to forgive such injunctions for saintly persons are more important than any political emergency arjuna considered that rather than kill his own kinsmen for political reasons it would be better to forgive them on grounds of religion and saintly behavior he did not therefore consider such killing profitable simply for the matter of temporary bodily happiness after all kingdoms and pleasures derived therefrom are not permanent so why should he risk his life and eternal salvation by killing his own kinsmen arjunas addressing of ka as mdhava or the husband of the goddess of fortune is also significant in this connection he wanted to point out to ka that as husband of the goddess of fortune he should not have to induce arjuna to take up a matter which would ultimately bring about misfortune ka however never brings misfortune to anyone to say nothing of his devotees texts 3738 yadyapy ete na payanti lobhopahatacetasa kulakayakta doa mitradrohe ca ptakam katha na jeyam asmbhi ppd asmn nivartitum kulakayakta doa

of the sin engage in these acts purport a katriya is not supposed to refuse to battle or gamble when he is so invited by some rival party under such obligation arjuna could not refuse to fight because he was challenged by the party of duryodhana in this connection arjuna considered that the other party might be blind to the effects of such a challenge arjuna however could see the evil consequences and could not accept the challenge obligation is actually binding when the effect is good but when the effect is otherwise then no one can be bound considering all these pros and cons arjuna decided not to fight text 39 kulakaye praayanti kuladharm santan dharme nae kula ktsnam adharmo bhibhavaty uta kulakayein destroying the family praayantibecomes vanquished kuladharmthe family traditions

tradition is vanquished and thus the rest of the family becomes involved in irreligious practice purport in the system of the varrama institution there are many principles of religious traditions to help members of the family grow properly and attain spiritual values the elder members are responsible for such purifying processes in the family beginning from birth to death but on the death of the elder members such family traditions of purification may stop and the remaining younger family members may develop irreligious habits and thereby lose their chance for spiritual salvation therefore for no purpose should the elder members of the family be slain text 40 adharmbhibhavt ka praduyanti kulastriya stru dusu vreya jyate varasakara adharmairreligion abhibhavthaving been predominant ka o

prominent in the family o ka the women of the family become corrupt and from the degradation of womanhood o descendant of vi comes unwanted progeny purport good population in human society is the basic principle for peace prosperity and spiritual progress in life the varrama religions principles were so designed that the good population would prevail in society for the general spiritual progress of state and community such population depends on the chastity and faithfulness of its womanhood as children are very prone to be misled women are similarly very prone to degradation therefore both children and women require protection by the elder members of the family by being engaged in various religious practices women will not be misled into adultery according to cakya pait women are generally not very intelligent and therefore not trustworthy so the different family traditions of religious activities should always engage them and thus their chastity and devotion will give birth to a good population eligible for participating in the varrama system on the failure of such varramadharma naturally the women become free to act and mix with men and thus adultery is indulged in at the risk of unwanted population irresponsible men also provoke adultery in society and thus unwanted children flood the human race at the risk of war and pestilence text 41 sakaro

situation is created both for the family and for those who destroy the family tradition in such corrupt families there is no offering of oblations of food and water to the ancestors purport according to the rules and regulations of fruitive activities there is a need to offer periodical food and water to the forefathers of the family this offering is performed by worship of viu because eating the remnants of food offered to viu can deliver one from all kinds of sinful actions sometimes the forefathers may be suffering from various types of sinful reactions and sometimes some of them cannot even acquire a gross material body and are forced to remain in subtle bodies as ghosts thus when remnants of prasdam food are offered to forefathers by descendants the forefathers are released from ghostly or other kinds of miserable life such help rendered to forefathers is a family tradition and those who are not in devotional life are required to perform such rituals one who is engaged in the devotional life is not required to perform such actions simply by performing devotional service one can deliver hundreds and thousands of forefathers from all kinds of misery it is stated in the bhgavatam devaribhtptan pit na kikaro nyam ca rjan sarvtman ya araa araya gato mukunda parihtya kartam anyone who has taken shelter of the lotus feet of mukunda the giver of liberation giving up all kinds of obligation and has taken to the path in all seriousness owes neither duties nor obligations to the demigods sages general living entities family members humankind or forefathers bhg 11541

society combined with family welfare activities as they are set forth by the institution of the santanadharma or varramadharma are designed to enable the human being to attain his ultimate salvation therefore the breaking of the santanadharma tradition by irresponsible leaders of society brings about chaos in that society and consequently people forget the aim of lifeviu such leaders are called blind and persons who follow such leaders are sure to be led into chaos text 43 utsannakuladharm manuy janrdana narake niyata vso bhavatty anuuruma utsannaspoiled kuladharmmof those who have the

people i have heard by disciplic succession that those who destroy family traditions dwell always in hell purport arjuna bases his argument not on his own personal experience but on what he has heard from the authorities that is the way of receiving real knowledge one cannot reach the real point of factual knowledge without being helped by the right person who is already established in that knowledge there is a system in the varrama institution by which one has to undergo the process of ablution before death for his sinful activities one who is always engaged in sinful activities must utilize the process of ablution called the pryacitta without doing so one surely will be transferred to hellish planets to undergo miserable lives as the result of sinful activities text 44 aho bata

desire to enjoy royal happiness purport driven by selfish motives one may be inclined to such sinful acts as the killing of ones own brother father or mother there are many such instances in the history of the world but arjuna being a saintly devotee of the lord is always conscious of moral principles and therefore takes care to avoid such activities text 45 yadi mm apratkram aastra astrapaya

with them purport it is the customaccording to katriya fighting principlesthat an unarmed and unwilling foe should not be attacked arjuna however in such an enigmatic position decided he would not fight if he were attacked by the enemy he did not consider how much the other party was bent upon fighting all these symptoms are due to softheartedness resulting from his being a great devotee of the lord text 46 sajaya uvca evam uktvrjuna sakhye rathopastha upviat visjya saara cpa okasavignamnasa sajayasajaya uvcasaid evamthus uktvsaying arjuna arjuna sakhyein the battlefield rathachariot

was so afflicted with lamentation that he sat down again setting aside his bow and arrows such a kind and softhearted person in the devotional service of the lord is fit to receive selfknowledge thus end the bhaktivedanta purports to the first chapter of the rmadbhagavadgt in the matter of observing the armies on the battlefield of kuruketra chapter two contents of the gt summarized text 1 sajaya

spoke the following words purport material compassion lamentation and tears are all signs of ignorance of the real self compassion for the eternal soul is selfrealization the word madhusdana is significant in this verse lord ka killed the demon madhu and now arjuna wanted ka to kill the demon of misunderstanding that had overtaken him in the discharge of his duty no one knows where compassion should be applied compassion for the dress of a drowning man is senseless a man fallen in the ocean of nescience cannot be saved simply by rescuing his outward dressthe gross material body one who does not know this and laments for the outward dress is called a dra or one who laments unnecessarily arjuna was a katriya and this conduct was not expected from him lord ka however can dissipate the lamentation of the ignorant man and for this purpose the bhagavad gt was sung by him this chapter instructs us in selfrealization by an analytical study of the material body and the spirit soul as explained by the supreme authority lord r ka this realization is made possible by working with the fruitive being situated in the fixed conception of the real self text 2 rbhagavn uvca

arjuna translation the supreme person bhagavn said my dear arjuna how have these impurities come upon you they are not at all befitting a man who knows the progressive values of life they do not lead to higher planets but to infamy purport ka and the supreme personality of godhead are identical therefore lord ka is referred to as bhagavn throughout the gt bhagavn is the ultimate in the absolute truth absolute truth is realized in three phases of understanding namely brahman or the impersonal allpervasive spirit paramtm or the localized aspect of the supreme within the heart of all living entities and bhagavn or the supreme personality of godhead lord ka in the rmadbhgavatam this conception of the absolute truth is explained thus vadanti tat tattvavidas tattva yaj jnam advayam brahmeti paramtmeti bhagavn iti abdyate the absolute truth is realized in three phases of understanding by the knower of the absolute truth and all of them are identical such phases of the absolute truth are expressed as brahman paramtm and bhagavn bhg 1211 these three divine aspects can be explained by the example of the sun which also has three different aspects namely the sunshine the suns surface and the sun planet itself one who studies the sunshine only is the preliminary student one who understands the suns surface is further advanced and one who can enter into the sun planet is the highest ordinary students who are satisfied by simply understanding the sunshineits universal pervasiveness and the glaring effulgence of its impersonal naturemay be compared to those who can realize only the brahman feature of the absolute truth the student who has advanced still further can know the sun disc which is compared to knowledge of the paramtm feature of the absolute truth and the student who can enter into the heart of the sun planet is compared to those who realize the personal features of the supreme absolute truth therefore the bhaktas or the transcendentalists who have realized the bhagavn feature of the absolute truth are the topmost transcendentalists although all students who are engaged in the study of the absolute truth are engaged in the same subject matter the sunshine the sun disc and the inner affairs of the sun planet cannot be separated from one another and yet the students of the three different phases are not in the same category the sanskrit word bhagavn is explained by the great authority parara muni the father of vysadeva the supreme personality who possesses all riches all strength all fame all beauty all knowledge and all renunciation is called bhagavn there are many persons who are very rich very powerful very beautiful very famous very learned and very much detached but no one can claim that he possesses all riches all strength etc entirely only ka can claim this because he is the supreme personality of godhead no living entity including brahm lord iva or nryaa can possess opulences as fully as ka therefore it is concluded in the brahmasahit by lord brahm himself that lord ka is the supreme personality of godhead no one is equal to or above him he is the primeval lord or bhagavn known as govinda and he is the supreme cause of all causes vara parama ka saccidnandavigraha andir dir govinda sarvakraakraam there are many personalities possessing the qualities of bhagavn but ka is the supreme because none can excel him he is the supreme person and his body is eternal full of knowledge and bliss he is the primeval lord govinda and the cause of all causes in the bhgavatam also there is a list of many incarnations of the supreme personality of godhead but ka is described as the original personality of godhead from whom many many incarnations and personalities of godhead expand ete cakal pusa kas tu bhagavn svayam indrrivykula loka mayanti yuge yuge all the lists of the incarnations of godhead submitted herewith are either plenary expansions or parts of the plenary expansions of the supreme godhead but ka is the supreme personality of godhead himself bhg 1328 therefore ka is the original supreme personality of godhead the absolute truth the source of both the supersoul and the impersonal brahman in the presence of the supreme personality of godhead arjunas lamentation for his kinsmen is certainly unbecoming and therefore ka expressed his surprise with the word kutas wherefrom such unmanly sentiments were never expected from a person belonging to the civilized class of men known as ryans the word ryan is applicable to persons who know the value of life and have a civilization based on spiritual realization persons who are led by the material conception of life do not know that the aim of life is realization of the absolute truth viu or bhagavn and they are captivated by the external features of the material world and therefore they do not know what liberation is persons who have no knowledge of liberation from material bondage are called nonryans although arjuna was a katriya he was deviating from his prescribed duties by declining to fight this act of cowardice is described as befitting the nonryans such deviation from duty does not help one in the progress of spiritual life nor does it even give one the opportunity to become famous in this world lord ka did not approve of the so called compassion of arjuna for his kinsmen text 3 klaibya m sma gama prtha naitat tvayy

petty weakness of heart and arise o chastiser of the enemy purport arjuna was addressed as the son of pth who happened to be the sister of kas father vasudeva therefore arjuna had a blood relationship with ka if the son of a katriya declines to fight he is a katriya in name only and if the son of a brhmaa acts impiously he is a brhmaa in name only such katriyas and brhmaas are unworthy sons of their fathers therefore ka did not want arjuna to become an unworthy son of a katriya arjuna was the most intimate friend of ka and ka was directly guiding him on the chariot but in spite of all these credits if arjuna abandoned the battle he would be committing an infamous act therefore ka said that such an attitude in arjuna did not fit his personality arjuna might argue that he would give up the battle on the grounds of his magnanimous attitude for the most respectable bhma and his relatives but ka considered that sort of magnanimity not approved by authority therefore such magnanimity or socalled nonviolence should be given up by persons like arjuna under the direct guidance of ka text 4 arjuna uvca katha bhmam aha sakhye droa ca madhusdana iubhi pratiyotsymi pjrhv arisdana arjuna

superiors like bhma the grandfather and drocrya the teacher are always worshipable even if they attack they should not be counterattacked it is general etiquette that superiors are not to be offered even a verbal fight even if they are sometimes harsh in behavior they should not be harshly treated then how is it possible for arjuna to counterattack them would ka ever attack his own grandfather

duryodhana because of his financial assistance although they should not have accepted such a position simply on financial considerations under the circumstances they have lost the respectability of teachers but arjuna thinks that nevertheless they remain his superiors and therefore to enjoy material profits after killing them would mean to enjoy spoils tainted with blood text 6 na caitad vidma

be his only means of subsistence nor was there certainty of victory because either side might emerge victorious even if victory awaited them and their cause was justified still if the sons of dhtarra died in battle it would be very difficult to live in their absence under the circumstances that would be another kind of defeat for them all these considerations by arjuna definitely prove that he was not only a great devotee of the lord but that he was also highly enlightened and had complete control over his mind and senses his desire to live by begging although he was born in the royal household is another sign of detachment he was truly virtuous as these qualities combined with his faith in the words of instruction of r ka his spiritual master indicate it is concluded that arjuna was quite fit for liberation unless the senses are controlled there is no chance of elevation to the platform of knowledge and without knowledge and devotion there is no chance of liberation arjuna was competent in all these attributes over and above his enormous attributes in his material relationships text 7 krpayadoopahatasvabhva pcchmi tv dharmasamhacet yac chreya syn nicita brhi tan me iyas te

composure because of weakness in this condition i am asking you to tell me clearly what is best for me now i am your disciple and a soul surrendered unto you please instruct me purport by natures own way the complete system of material activities is a source of perplexity for everyone in every step there is perplexity and therefore it behooves one to approach a bona fide spiritual master who can give one proper guidance for executing the purpose of life all vedic literatures advise us to approach a bona fide spiritual master to get free from the perplexities of life which happen without our desire they are like a forest fire that somehow blazes without being set by anyone similarly the world situation is such that perplexities of life automatically appear without our wanting such confusion no one wants fire and yet it takes place and we become perplexed the vedic wisdom therefore advises that in order to solve the perplexities of life and to understand the science of the solution one must approach a spiritual master who is in the disciplic succession a person with a bona fide spiritual master is supposed to know everything one should not therefore remain in material perplexities but should approach a spiritual master this is the purport of this verse who is the man in material perplexities it is he who does not understand the problems of life in the garga upaniad the perplexed man is described as follows yo v etad akara grgy aviditvsml lokt praiti sa kpaa he is a miserly man who does not solve the problems of life as a human and who thus quits this world like the cats and dogs without understanding the science of selfrealization this human form of life is a most valuable asset for the living entity who can ultilize it for solving the problems of life therefore one who does not utilize this opportunity properly is a miser on the other hand there is the brhmaa or he who is intelligent enough to utilize this body to solve all the problems of life the kpaas or miserly persons waste their time in being overly affectionate for family society country etc in the material conception of life one is often attached to family life namely to wife children and other members on the basis of skin disease the kpaa thinks that he is able to protect his family members from death or the kpaa thinks that his family or society can save him from the verge of death such family attachment can be found even in the lower animals who take care of children also being intelligent arjuna could understand that his affection for family members and his wish to protect them from death were the causes of his perplexities although he could understand that his duty to fight was awaiting him still on account of miserly weakness he could not discharge the duties he is therefore asking lord ka the supreme spiritual master to make a definite solution he offers himself to ka as a disciple he wants to stop friendly talks talks between the master and the disciple are serious and now arjuna wants to talk very seriously before the recognized spiritual master ka is therefore the original spiritual master of the science of bhagavadgt and arjuna is the first disciple for understanding the gt how arjuna understands the bhagavadgt is stated in the gt itself and yet foolish mundane scholars explain that one need not submit to ka as a person but to the unborn within ka there is no difference between kas within and without and one who has no sense of this understanding is the greatest fool in trying to understand bhagavadgt text 8 na hi prapaymi mampanudyd

away this grief which is drying up my senses i will not be able to destroy it even if i win an unrivalled kingdom on the earth with sovereignty like the demigods in heaven purport although arjuna was putting forward so many arguments based on knowledge of the principles of religion and moral codes it appears that he was unable to solve his real problem without the help of the spiritual master lord r ka he could understand that his socalled knowledge was useless in driving away his problems which were drying up his whole existence and it was impossible for him to solve such perplexities without the help of a spiritual master like lord ka academic knowledge scholarship high position etc are all useless in solving the problems of life help can only be given by a spiritual master like ka therefore the conclusion is that a spiritual master who is one hundred percent ka conscious is the bona fide spiritual master for he can solve the problems of life lord caitanya said that one who is master in the science of ka consciousness regardless of his social position is the real spiritual master kibvipra kib nys dra kene naya yei katattvavett sei guru haya caitanyacaritmta madhya 8127 it does not matter whether a person is a vipra learned scholar in vedic wisdom or is born in a lower family or is in the renounced order of lifeif he is master in the science of ka he is the perfect and bona fide spiritual master so without being a master in the science of ka consciousness no one is a bona fide spiritual master it is also said in vedic literatures akarmanipuo vipro mantratantravirada avaiavo gurur na syd vaiava vapaco guru a scholarly brhmaa expert in all subjects of vedic knowledge is unfit to become a spiritual master without being a vaiava or expert in the science of ka consciousness but a person born in a family of a lower caste can become a spiritual master if he is a vaiava or ka conscious the problems of material existencebirth old age disease and death cannot be counteracted by accumulation of wealth and economic development in many parts of the world there are states which are replete with all facilities of life which are full of wealth and economically developed yet the problems of material existence are still present they are seeking peace in different ways but they can achieve real happiness only if they consult ka or the bhagavadgt and rmadbhgavatamwhich constitute the science of kaor the bona fide representative of ka the man in ka consciousness if economic development and material comforts could drive away ones lamentations for family social national or international inebrieties then arjuna would not have said that even an unrivalled kingdom on earth or supremacy like that of the demigods in the heavenly planets would not be able to drive away his lamentations he sought therefore refuge in ka consciousness and that is the right path for peace and harmony economic development or supremacy over the world can be finished at any moment by the cataclysms of material nature even elevation into a higher planetary situation as men are now seeking a place on the moon planet can also be finished at one stroke the bhagavadgt confirms this ke puye martyaloka vianti when the results of pious activities are finished one falls down again from the peak of happiness to the lowest status of life many politicians of the world have fallen down in that way such downfalls only constitute more causes for lamentation therefore if we want to curb lamentation for good then we have to take shelter of ka as arjuna is seeking to do so arjuna asked ka to solve his problem definitely and that is the way of ka consciousness text 9 sajaya uvca evam uktv hkea gukea parantapa na yotsya iti govindam uktv t babhva ha sajaya uvcasajaya

the giver of pleasure uktv saying tmsilent babhvabecame hacertainly translation sajaya said having spoken thus arjuna chastiser of enemies told ka govinda i shall not fight and fell silent purport dhtarra must have been very glad to understand that arjuna was not going to fight and was instead leaving the battlefield for the begging profession but sajaya disappointed him again in relating that arjuna was competent to kill his enemies parantapa although arjuna was for the time being overwhelmed with false grief due to family affection he surrendered unto ka the supreme spiritual master as a disciple this indicated that he would soon be free from the false lamentation resulting from family affection and would be enlightened with perfect knowledge of selfrealization or ka consciousness and would then surely fight thus dhtarras joy would be frustrated since arjuna would be enlightened by ka and would fight to the end text 10 tam uvca hkea prahasann iva bhrata senayor ubhayor madhye

vidantamunto the lamenting one idamthe following vaca words translation o descendant of bharata at that time ka smiling in the midst of both the armies spoke the following words to the griefstricken arjuna purport the talk was going on between intimate friends namely the hkea and the gukea as friends both of them were on the same level but one of them voluntarily became a student of the other ka was smiling because a friend had chosen to become a disciple as lord of all he is always in the superior position as the master of everyone and yet the lord accepts one who wishes to be a friend a son a lover or a devotee or who wants him in such a role but when he was accepted as the master he at once assumed the role and talked with the disciple like the master with gravity as it is required it appears that the talk between the master and the disciple was openly exchanged in the presence of both armies so that all were benefitted so the talks of bhagavadgt are not for any particular person society or community but they are for all and friends or enemies are equally entitled to hear them text 11 rbhagavn uvca aocyn anvaocas tva prajvd ca bhase gatsn agats ca nnuocanti pait r bhagavn

neither for the living nor the dead purport the lord at once took the position of the teacher and chastised the student calling him indirectly a fool the lord said you are talking like a learned man but you do not know that one who is learnedone who knows what is body and what is souldoes not lament for any stage of the body neither in the living nor in the dead condition as it will be explained in later chapters it will be clear that knowledge means to know matter and spirit and the controller of both arjuna argued that religious principles should be given more importance than politics or sociology but he did not know that knowledge of matter soul and the supreme is even more important than religious formularies and because he was lacking in that knowledge he should not have posed himself as a very learned man as he did not happen to be a very learned man he was consequently lamenting for something which was unworthy of lamentation the body is born and is destined to be vanquished today or tomorrow therefore the body is not as important as the soul one who knows this is actually learned and for him there is no cause for lamentation regardless of the condition of the material body text 12 na tv evha jtu nsa na tva neme jandhip na caiva na bhaviyma sarve vayam ata param nanever tubut evacertainly ahami jtubecome nanever samexisted nait is not so tvamyourself nanot

all these kings nor in the future shall any of us cease to be purport in the vedas in the kaha upaniad as well as in the vetvatara upaniad it is said that the supreme personality of godhead is the maintainer of innumerable living entities in terms of their different situations according to individual work and reaction of work that supreme personality of godhead is also by his plenary portions alive in the heart of every living entity only saintly persons who can see within and without the same supreme lord can actually attain to perfect and eternal peace nityo nityn cetana cetannm eko bahn yo vidadhti kmn tam tmastha ye nupayanti dhrs te nti vat netarem kaha 2213 the same vedic truth given to arjuna is given to all persons in the world who pose themselves as very learned but factually have but a poor fund of knowledge the lord says clearly that he himself arjuna and all the kings who are assembled on the battlefield are eternally individual beings and that the lord is eternally the maintainer of the individual living entities both in their conditioned as well as in their liberated situations the supreme personality of godhead is the supreme individual person and arjuna the lords eternal associate and all the kings assembled there are individual eternal persons it is not that they did not exist as individuals in the past and it is not that they will not remain eternal persons their individuality existed in the past and their individuality will continue in the future without interruption therefore there is no cause for lamentation for anyone the myvd theory that after liberation the individual soul separated by the covering of my or illusion will merge into the impersonal brahman and lose its individual existence is not supported herein by lord ka the supreme authority nor is the theory that we only think of individuality in the conditioned state supported herein ka clearly says herein that in the future also the individuality of the lord and others as it is confirmed in the upaniads will continue eternally this statement of ka is authoritative because ka cannot be subject to illusion if individuality is not a fact then ka would not have stressed it so much even for the future the myvd may argue that the individuality spoken of by ka is not spiritual but material even accepting the argument that the individuality is material then how can one distinguish kas individuality ka affirms his individuality in the past and confirms his individuality in the future also he has confirmed his individuality in many ways and impersonal brahman has been declared to be subordinate to him ka has maintained spiritual individuality all along if he is accepted as an ordinary conditioned soul in individual consciousness then his bhagavadgt has no value as authoritative scripture a common man with all the four defects of human frailty is unable to teach that which is worth hearing the gt is above such literature no mundane book compares with the bhagavadgt when one accepts ka as an ordinary man the gt loses all importance the myvd argues that the plurality mentioned in this verse is conventional and that it refers to the body but previous to this verse such a bodily conception is already condemned after condemning the bodily conception of the living entities how was it possible for ka to place a conventional proposition on the body again therefore individuality is maintained on spiritual grounds and is thus confirmed by great cryas like r rmnuja and others it is clearly mentioned in many places in the gt that this spiritual individuality is understood by those who are devotees of the lord those who are envious of ka as the supreme personality of godhead have no bona fide access to the great literature the nondevotees approach to the teachings of the gta is something like bees licking on a bottle of honey one cannot have a taste of honey unless one opens the bottle similarly the mysticism of the bhagavadgt can be understood only by devotees and no one else can taste it as it is stated in the fourth chapter of the book nor can the gt be touched by persons who envy the very existence of the lord therefore the myvd explanation of the gt is a most misleading presentation of the whole truth lord caitanya has forbidden us to read commentations made by the myvds and warns that one who takes to such an understanding of the myvd philosophy loses all power to understand the real mystery of the gt if individuality refers to the empirical universe then there is no need of teaching by the lord the plurality of the individual soul and of the lord is an eternal fact and it is confirmed by the vedas as above mentioned text 13 dehino smin yath dehe kaumra yauvana jar tath dehntaraprptir dhras tatra

tatrathereupon nanever muhyatideluded translation as the embodied soul continually passes in this body from boyhood to youth to old age the soul similarly passes into another body at death the selfrealized soul is not bewildered by such a change purport since every living entity is an individual soul each is changing his body every moment manifesting sometimes as a child sometimes as a youth and sometimes as an old man yet the same spirit soul is there and does not undergo any change this individual soul finally changes the body at death and transmigrates to another body and since it is sure to have another body in the next birtheither material or spiritualthere was no cause for lamentation by arjuna on account of death neither for bhma nor for droa for whom he was so much concerned rather he should rejoice for their changing bodies from old to new ones thereby rejuvenating their energy such changes of body account for varieties of enjoyment or suffering according to ones work in life so bhma and droa being noble souls were surely going to have either spiritual bodies in the next life or at least life in heavenly bodies for superior enjoyment of material existence so in either case there was no cause of lamentation any man who has perfect knowledge of the constitution of the individual soul the supersoul and natureboth material and spiritualis called a dhra or a most sober man such a man is never deluded by the change of bodies the myvd theory of oneness of the spirit soul cannot be entertained on the ground that spirit soul cannot be cut into pieces as a fragmental portion such cutting into different individual souls would make the supreme cleavable or changeable against the principle of the supreme soul being unchangeable as confirmed in the gt the fragmental portions of the supreme exist eternally santana and are called kara that is they have a tendency to fall down into material nature these fragmental portions are eternally so and even after liberation the individual soul remains the samefragmental but once liberated he lives an eternal life in bliss and knowledge with the personality of godhead the theory of reflection can be applied to the supersoul who is present in each and every individual body and is known as the paramtm who is different from the individual living entity when the sky is reflected in water the reflections represent both the sun and the moon and the stars also the stars can be compared to the living entities and the sun or the moon to the supreme lord the individual fragmental spirit soul is represented by arjuna and the supreme soul is the personality of godhead r ka they are not on the same level as it will be apparent in the beginning of the fourth chapter if arjuna is on the same level with ka and ka is not superior to arjuna then their relationship of instructor and instructed becomes meaningless if both of them are deluded by the illusory energy my then there is no need of one being the instructor and the other the instructed such instruction would be useless because in the clutches of my no one can be an authoritative instructor under the circumstances it is admitted that lord ka is the supreme lord superior in position to the living entity arjuna who is a forgotten soul deluded by my text 14 mtrspars tu kaunteya toasukhadukhad gampyino nitys ts titikasva bhrata mtrsensuous

descendant of the bhrata dynasty translation o son of kunt the nonpermanent appearance of happiness and distress and their disappearance in due course are like the appearance and disappearance of winter and summer seasons they arise from sense perception o scion of bharata and one must learn to tolerate them without being disturbed purport in the proper discharge of duty one has to learn to tolerate nonpermanent appearances and disappearances of happiness and distress according to vedic injunction one has to take his bath early in the morning even during the month of mgha january february it is very cold at that time but in spite of that a man who abides by the religious principles does not hesitate to take his bath similarly a woman does not hesitate to cook in the kitchen in the months of may and june the hottest part of the summer season one has to execute his duty in spite of climatic inconveniences similarly to fight is the religious principle of the katriyas and although one has to fight with some friend or relative one should not deviate from his prescribed duty one has to follow the prescribed rules and regulations of religious principles in order to rise up to the platform of knowledge because by knowledge and devotion only can one liberate himself from the clutches of my illusion the two different names of address given to arjuna are also significant to address him as kaunteya signifies his great blood relations from his mothers side and to address him as bhrata signifies his greatness from his fathers side from both sides he is supposed to have a great heritage a great heritage brings responsibility in the matter of proper discharge of duties therefore he cannot avoid fighting text 15 ya hi na vyathayanty ete purua puruarabha samadukhasukha

liberation purport anyone who is steady in his determination for the advanced stage of spiritual realization and can equally tolerate the onslaughts of distress and happiness is certainly a person eligible for liberation in the varrama institution the fourth stage of life namely the renounced order sannysa is a painstaking situation but one who is serious about making his life perfect surely adopts the sannysa order of life in spite of all difficulties the difficulties usually arise from having to sever family relationships to give up the connection of wife and children but if anyone is able to tolerate such difficulties surely his path to spiritual realization is complete similarly in arjunas discharge of duties as a katriya he is advised to persevere even if it is difficult to fight with his family members or similarly beloved persons lord caitanya took sannysa at the age of twentyfour and his dependants young wife as well as old mother had no one else to look after them yet for a higher cause he took sannysa and was steady in the discharge of higher duties that is the way of achieving liberation from material bondage text 16 nsato vidyate bhvo nbhvo vidyate sata

reactions of the different cells is admitted by modern medical science and thus growth and old age are taking place in the body but the spirit soul exists permanently remaining the same despite all changes of the body and the mind that is the difference between matter and spirit by nature the body is ever changing and the soul is eternal this conclusion is established by all classes of seers of the truth both impersonalist and personalist in the viu pura it is stated that viu and his abodes all have selfilluminated spiritual existence jyoti viur bhavanni viuthe words existent and nonexistent refer only to spirit and matter that is the version of all seers of truth this is the beginning of the instruction by the lord to the living entities who are bewildered by the influence of ignorance removal of ignorance involves the reestablishment of the eternal relationship between the worshiper and the worshipable and the consequent understanding of the difference between the part and parcel living entities and the supreme personality of godhead one can understand the nature of the supreme by thorough study of oneself the difference between oneself and the supreme being understood as the relationship between the part and the whole in the vedntastras as well as in the rmadbhgavatam the supreme has been accepted as the origin of all emanations such emanations are experienced by superior and inferior natural sequences the living entities belong to the superior nature as it will be revealed in the seventh chapter although there is no difference between the energy and the energetic the energetic is accepted as the supreme and energy or nature is accepted as the subordinate the living entities therefore are always subordinate to the supreme lord as in the case of the master and the servant or the teacher and the taught such clear knowledge is impossible to understand under the spell of ignorance and to drive away such ignorance the lord teaches the bhagavadgt for the enlightenment of all living entities for all time text 17 avini tu tad viddhi yena sarvam ida tatam vinam avyayasysya na kacit kartum arhati aviniimperishable tubut tatthat viddhiknow it yenaby whom

indestructible no one is able to destroy the imperishable soul purport this verse more clearly explains the real nature of the soul which is spread all over the body anyone can understand what is spread all over the body it is consciousness everyone is conscious of the pains and pleasures of the body in part or as a whole this spreading of consciousness is limited within ones own body the pains and pleasures of one body are unknown to another therefore each and every body is the embodiment of an individual soul and the symptom of the souls presence is perceived as individual consciousness this soul is described as one tenthousandth part of the upper portion of the hair point in size the vetvatara upaniad confirms this blgraatabhgasya atadh kalpitasya ca bhgo jva sa vijeya sa cnantyya kalpate when the upper point of a hair is divided into one hundred parts and again each of such parts is further divided into one hundred parts each such part is the measurement of the dimension of the spirit soul vet 59 similarly in the bhgavatam the same version is stated kegraatabhgasya ata sdtmaka jva skmasvarupo ya sakhytto hi citkaa there are innumerable particles of spiritual atoms which are measured as one tenthousandth of the upper portion of the hair therefore the individual particle of spirit soul is a spiritual atom smaller than the material atoms and such atoms are innumerable this very small spiritual spark is the basic principle of the material body and the influence of such a spiritual spark is spread all over the body as the influence of the active principle of some medicine spreads throughout the body this current of the spirit soul is felt all over the body as consciousness and that is the proof of the presence of the soul any layman can understand that the material body minus consciousness is a dead body and this consciousness cannot be revived in the body by any means of material administration therefore consciousness is not due to any amount of material combination but to the spirit soul in the muaka upaniad the measurement of the atomic spirit soul is further explained eo urtm cetas veditavyo yasmin pra pacadh savivea prai citta sarvam otam prajn yasmin viuddhe vibhavaty ea tm the soul is atomic in size and can be perceived by perfect intelligence this atomic soul is floating in the five kinds of air pra apna vyna samna and udna is situated within the heart and spreads its influence all over the body of the embodied living entities when the soul is purified from the contamination of the five kinds of material air its spiritual influence is exhibited mu 319 the hahayoga system is meant for controlling the five kinds of air encircling the pure soul by different kinds of sitting posturesnot for any material profit but for liberation of the minute soul from the entanglement of the material atmosphere so the constitution of the atomic soul is admitted in all vedic literatures and it is also actually felt in the practical experience of any sane man only the insane man can think of this atomic soul as allpervading viutattva the influence of the atomic soul can be spread all over a particular body according to the muaka upaniad this atomic soul is situated in the heart of every living entity and because the measurement of the atomic soul is beyond the power of appreciation of the material scientists some of them assert foolishly that there is no soul the individual atomic soul is definitely there in the heart along with the supersoul and thus all the energies of bodily movement are emanating from this part of the body the corpuscles which carry the oxygen from the lungs gather energy from the soul when the soul passes away from this position activity of the blood generating fusion ceases medical science accepts the importance of the red corpuscles but it cannot ascertain that the source of the energy is the soul medical science however does admit that the heart is the seat of all energies of the body such atomic particles of the spirit whole are compared to the sunshine molecules in the sunshine there are innumerable radiant molecules similarly the fragmental parts of the supreme lord are atomic sparks of the rays of the supreme lord called by the name prabh or superior energy neither vedic knowledge nor modern science denies the existence of the spirit soul in the body and the science of the soul is explicitly described in the bhagavadgt by the personality of godhead himself text 18 antavanta ime deh nityasyokt arria anino prameyasya tasmd yudhyasva bhrata antavantaperishable imeall these

bharata translation only the material body of the indestructible immeasurable and eternal living entity is subject to destruction therefore fight o descendant of bharata purport the material body is perishable by nature it may perish immediately or it may do so after a hundred years it is a question of time only there is no chance of maintaining it indefinitely but the spirit soul is so minute that it cannot even be seen by an enemy to say nothing of being killed as mentioned in the previous verse it is so small that no one can have any idea how to measure its dimension so from both viewpoints there is no cause of lamentation because the living entity can neither be killed as he is nor can the material body which cannot be saved for any length of time be permanently protected the minute particle of the whole spirit acquires this material body according to his work and therefore observance of religious principles should be utilized in the vedntastras the living entity is qualified as light because he is part and parcel of the supreme light as sunlight maintains the entire universe so the light of the soul maintains this material body as soon as the spirit soul is out of this material body the body begins to decompose therefore it is the spirit soul which maintains this body the body itself is unimportant arjuna was advised to fight and sacrifice the material body for the cause of religion text 19 ya ena vetti hantra ya caina manyate hatam ubhau tau na vijnto nya hanti na hanyate yaanyone enamthis vettiknows hantramthe killer ya anyone caalso enamthis

that he is slain does not understand one who is in knowledge knows that the self slays not nor is slain purport when an embodied living entity is hurt by fatal weapons it is to be known that the living entity within the body is not killed the spirit soul is so small that it is impossible to kill him by any material weapon as is evident from the previous verses nor is the living entity killable because of his spiritual constitution what is killed or is supposed to be killed is the body only this however does not at all encourage killing of the body the vedic injunction is mhisyt sarvabhtni never commit violence to anyone nor does understanding that the living entity is not killed encourage animal slaughter killing the body of anyone without authority is abominable and is punishable by the law of the state as well as by the law of the lord arjuna however is being engaged in killing for the principle of religion and not whimsically text 20 na jyate mriyate v kadcin nya

soul there is never birth nor death nor having once been does he ever cease to be he is unborn eternal everexisting undying and primeval he is not slain when the body is slain purport qualitatively the small atomic fragmental part of the supreme spirit is one with the supreme he undergoes no changes like the body sometimes the soul is called the steady or kastha the body is subject to six kinds of transformations it takes its birth in the womb of the mothers body remains for some time grows produces some effects gradually dwindles and at last vanishes into oblivion the soul however does not go through such changes the soul is not born but because he takes on a material body the body takes its birth the soul does not take birth there and the soul does not die anything which has birth also has death and because the soul has no birth he therefore has no past present or future he is eternal everexisting and primevalthat is there is no trace in history of his coming into being under the impression of the body we seek the history of birth etc of the soul the soul does not at any time become old as the body does the so called old man therefore feels himself to be in the same spirit as in his childhood or youth the changes of the body do not affect the soul the soul does not deteriorate like a tree nor anything material the soul has no byproduct either the byproducts of the body namely children are also different individual souls and owing to the body they appear as children of a particular man the body develops because of the souls presence but the soul has neither offshoots nor change therefore the soul is free from the six changes of the body in the kaha upaniad also we find a similar passage which reads na jyate mriyate v vipacin nya kutacin na vibhva kacit ajo nitya vato ya puro na hanyate hanyamne arre kaha 1218 the meaning and purport of this verse is the same as in the bhagavadgt but here in this verse there is one special word vipacit which means learned or with knowledge the soul is full of knowledge or full always with consciousness therefore consciousness is the symptom of the soul even if one does not find the soul within the heart where he is situated one can still understand the presence of the soul simply by the presence of consciousness sometimes we do not find the sun in the sky owing to clouds or for some other reason but the light of the sun is always there and we are convinced that it is therefore daytime as soon as there is a little light in the sky early in the morning we can understand that the sun is in the sky similarly since there is some consciousness in all bodieswhether man or animalwe can understand the presence of the soul this consciousness of the soul is however different from the consciousness of the supreme because the supreme consciousness is allknowledgepast present and future the consciousness of the individual soul is prone to be forgetful when he is forgetful of his real nature he obtains education and enlightenment from the superior lessons of ka but ka is not like the forgetful soul if so kas teachings of bhagavadgt would be useless there are two kinds of soulsnamely the minute particle soul autm and the supersoul the vibhutm this is also confirmed in the kaha upaniad in this way aor ayn mahato mahyn tmsya jantor nihito guhym tam akratu payati vtaoko dhtu prasdn mahimnam tmana kaha 1220 both the supersoul paramtm and the atomic soul jvtm are situated on the same tree of the body within the same heart of the living being and only one who has become free from all material desires as well as lamentations can by the grace of the supreme understand the glories of the soul ka is the fountainhead of the supersoul also as it will be disclosed in the following chapters and arjuna is the atomic soul forgetful of his real nature therefore he requires to be enlightened by ka or by his bona fide representative the spiritual master text 21 vedvinina nitya ya enam ajam avyayam katha sa

its proper utility and a man who is situated in complete knowledge knows how and where to apply a thing for its proper utility similarly violence also has its utility and how to apply violence rests with the person in knowledge although the justice of the peace awards capital punishment to a person condemned for murder the justice of the peace cannot be blamed because he orders violence to another person according to the codes of justice in manusahit the lawbook for mankind it is supported that a murderer should be condemned to death so that in his next life he will not have to suffer for the great sin he has committed therefore the kings punishment of hanging a murderer is actually beneficial similarly when ka orders fighting it must be concluded that violence is for supreme justice and as such arjuna should follow the instruction knowing well that such violence committed in the act of fighting for ka is not violence at all because at any rate the man or rather the soul cannot be killed so for the administration of justice so called violence is permitted a surgical operation is not meant to kill the patient but to cure him therefore the fighting to be executed by arjuna at the instruction of ka is with full knowledge so there is no possibility of sinful reaction text 22 vssi jrni yath vihya navni ghti naro pari tath arri vihya jrny anyni sayti navni deh

purport change of body by the atomic individual soul is an accepted fact even some of the modern scientists who do not believe in the existence of the soul but at the same time cannot explain the source of energy from the heart have to accept continuous changes of body which appear from childhood to boyhood and from boyhood to youth and again from youth to old age from old age the change is transferred to another body this has already been explained in the previous verse transference of the atomic individual soul to another body is made possible by the grace of the supersoulthe supersoul fulfills the desire of the atomic soul as one friend fulfills the desire of another the vedas like the muaka upaniad as well as the vetvatara upaniad compare the soul and the supersoul to two friendly birds sitting on the same tree one of the birds the individual atomic soul is eating the fruit of the tree and the other bird ka is simply watching his friend of these two birds although they are the same in qualityone is captivated by the fruits of the material tree while the other is simply witnessing the activities of his friend ka is the witnessing bird and arjuna is the eating bird although they are friends one is still the master and the other is the servant forgetfulness of this relationship by the atomic soul is the cause of ones changing his position from one tree to another or from one body to another the jva soul is struggling very hard on the tree of the material body but as soon as he agrees to accept the other bird as the supreme spiritual masteras arjuna agreed to do by voluntary surrender unto ka for instructionthe subordinate bird immediately becomes free from all lamentations both the kaha upaniad and vetvatara upaniad confirm this samne vke puruo nimagno nay ocati muhyamna jua yad payaty anyam am asya mahimnam iti vtaoka although the two birds are in the same tree the eating bird is fully engrossed with anxiety and moroseness as the enjoyer of the fruits of the tree but if in some way or other he turns his face to his friend who is the lord and knows his gloriesat once the suffering bird becomes free from all anxieties arjuna has now turned his face towards his eternal friend ka and is understanding the bhagavadgt from him and thus hearing from ka he can understand the supreme glories of the lord and be free from lamentation arjuna is advised herewith by the lord not to lament for the bodily change of his old grandfather and his teacher he should rather be happy to kill their bodies in the righteous fight so that they may be cleansed at once of all reactions from various bodily activities one who lays down his life on the sacrificial altar or in the proper battlefield is at once cleansed of bodily reactions and promoted to a higher status of life so there was no cause for arjunas lamentation text 23 naina chindanti astri naina dahati pvaka na caina kledayanty po na oayati mruta nanever enamunto this soul chindantican cut into pieces astri all weapons nanever enamunto this soul dahatiburns pvaka fire nanever caalso enamunto this soul kledayantimoistens pa water nanever oayatidries mrutawind translation the soul can never be cut into pieces by any weapon nor can he be burned by fire nor moistened by water nor withered by the wind purport all kinds of weapons swords flames rains tornadoes etc are unable to kill the spirit soul it appears that there were many kinds of weapons made of earth water air ether etc in addition to the modern weapons of fire even the nuclear weapons of the modern age are classified as fire weapons but formerly there were other weapons made of all different types of material elements firearms were counteracted by water weapons which are now unknown to modern science nor do modern scientists have knowledge of tornado weapons nonetheless the soul can never be cut into pieces nor annihilated by any number of weapons regardless of scientific devices nor was it ever possible to cut the individual souls from the original soul the myvd however cannot describe how the individual soul evolved from ignorance and consequently became covered by illusory energy because they are atomic individual souls santana eternally they are prone to be covered by the illusory energy and thus they become separated from the association of the supreme lord just as the sparks of the fire although one in quality with the fire are prone to be extinguished when out of the fire in the varha pura the living entities are described as separated parts and parcels of the supreme they are eternally so according to the bhagavadgt also so even after being liberated from illusion the living entity remains a separate identity as is evident from the teachings of the lord to arjuna arjuna became liberated by the knowledge received from ka but he never became one with ka text 24 acchedyo yam adhyo yam akledyo oya eva ca nitya sarvagata sthur acalo ya santana acchedyaunbreakable ayamthis soul

same translation this individual soul is unbreakable and insoluble and can be neither burned nor dried he is everlasting allpervading unchangeable immovable and eternally the same purport all these qualifications of the atomic soul definitely prove that the individual soul is eternally the atomic particle of the spirit whole and he remains the same atom eternally without change the theory of monism is very difficult to apply in this case because the individual soul is never expected to become one homogeneously after liberation from material contamination the atomic soul may prefer to remain as a spiritual spark in the effulgent rays of the supreme personality of godhead but the intelligent souls enter into the spiritual planets to associate with the personality of godhead the word sarvagata allpervading is significant because there is no doubt that living entities are all over gods creation they live on the land in the water in the air within the earth and even within fire the belief that they are sterilized in fire is not acceptable because it is clearly stated here that the soul cannot be burned by fire therefore there is no doubt that there are living entities also in the sun planet with suitable bodies to live there if the sun globe is uninhabited then the word sarvagataliving everywhere becomes meaningless text 25 avyakto yam acintyo yam avikryo yam ucyate tasmd

enamthis soul na do not anuocitummay lament over arhasiyou deserve translation it is said that the soul is invisible inconceivable immutable and unchangeable knowing this you should not grieve for the body purport as described previously the magnitude of the soul is so small for our material calculation that he cannot be seen even by the most powerful microscope therefore he is invisible as far as the souls existence is concerned no one can establish his existence experimentally beyond the proof of ruti or vedic wisdom we have to accept this truth because there is no other source of understanding the existence of the soul although it is a fact by perception there are many things we have to accept solely on grounds of superior authority no one can deny the existence of his father based upon the authority of his mother there is no other source of understanding the identity of the father except by the authority of the mother similarly there is no other source of understanding the soul except by studying the vedas in other words the soul is inconceivable by human experimental knowledge the soul is consciousness and consciousthat also is the statement of the vedas and we have to accept that unlike the bodily changes there is no change in the soul as eternally unchangeable the soul remains atomic in comparison to the infinite supreme soul the supreme soul is infinite and the atomic soul is infinitesimal therefore the infinitesimal soul being unchangeable can never become equal to the infinite soul or the supreme personality of godhead this concept is repeated in the vedas in different ways just to confirm the stability of the conception of the soul repetition of something is necessary in order that we understand the matter thoroughly without error text 26

tvamyou mahbhoo mightyarmed one nanever enam about the soul ocitumto lament arhasideserve translation if however you think that the soul is perpetually born and always dies still you have no reason to lament o mightyarmed purport there is always a class of philosophers almost akin to the buddhists who do not believe in the separate existence of the soul beyond the body when lord ka spoke the bhagavadgt it appears that such philosophers existed and they were known as the lokyatikas and vaibhikas these philosophers maintained that life symptoms or soul takes place at a certain mature condition of material combination the modern material scientist and materialist philosophers also think similarly according to them the body is a combination of physical elements and at a certain stage the life symptoms develop by interaction of the physical and chemical elements the science of anthropology is based on this philosophy currently many pseudoreligionsnow becoming fashionable in america are also adhering to this philosophy as well as to the nihilistic nondevotional buddhist sects even if arjuna did not believe in the existence of the soulas in the vaibhika philosophythere would still have been no cause for lamentation no one laments the loss of a certain bulk of chemicals and stops discharging his prescribed duty on the other hand in modern science and scientific warfare so many tons of chemicals are wasted for achieving victory over the enemy according to the vaibhika philosophy the socalled soul or tm vanishes along with the deterioration of the body so in any case whether arjuna accepted the vedic conclusion that there is an atomic soul or whether he did not believe in the existence of the soul he had no reason to lament according to this theory since there are so many living entities generating out of matter every moment and so many of them are being vanquished every moment there is no need to grieve for such an incidence however since he was not risking rebirth of the soul arjuna had no reason to be afraid of being affected with sinful reactions due to his killing his grandfather and teacher but at the same time ka sarcastically addressed arjuna as mahbhu mightyarmed because he at least did not accept the theory of the vaibhikas which leaves aside the vedic wisdom as a katriya arjuna belonged to the vedic culture and it behooved him to continue to follow its principles text 27 jtasya hi dhruvo mtyur dhruva janma mtasya ca tasmd aparihrye rthe na tva ocitum arhasi jtasyaone who has taken his birth hicertainly dhruvaa fact mtyudeath

one who has taken his birth death is certain and for one who is dead birth is certain therefore in the unavoidable discharge of your duty you should not lament purport one has to take birth according to ones activities of life and after finishing one term of activities one has to die to take birth for the next in this way the cycle of birth and death is revolving one after the other without liberation this cycle of birth and death does not however support unnecessary murder slaughter and war but at the same time violence and war are inevitable factors in human society for keeping law and order the battle of kuruketra being the will of the supreme was an inevitable event and to fight for the right cause is the duty of a katriya why should he be afraid of or aggrieved at the death of his relatives since he was discharging his proper duty he did not deserve to break the law thereby becoming subjected to the reactions of sinful acts of which he was so afraid by avoiding the discharge of his proper duty he would not be able to stop the death of his relatives and he would be degraded due to his selection of the wrong path of action text 28 avyaktdni bhtni vyaktamadhyni

unmanifest again when they are annihilated so what need is there for lamentation purport accepting that there are two classes of philosophers one believing in the existence of soul and the other not believing in the existence of the soul there is no cause for lamentation in either case nonbelievers in the existence of the soul are called atheists by followers of vedic wisdom yet even if for arguments sake we accept the atheistic theory there is still no cause for lamentation apart from the separate existence of the soul the material elements remain unmanifested before creation from this subtle state of unmanifestation comes manifestation just as from ether air is generated from air fire is generated from fire water is generated and from water earth becomes manifested from the earth many varieties of manifestations take place take for example a big skyscraper manifested from the earth when it is dismantled the manifestation becomes again unmanifested and remains as atoms in the ultimate stage the law of conservation of energy remains but in course of time things are manifested and unmanifestedthat is the difference then what cause is there for lamentation either in the stage of manifestation or unmanifestation somehow or other even in the unmanifested stage things are not lost both at the beginning and at the end all elements remain unmanifested and only in the middle are they manifested and this does not make any real material difference and if we accept the vedic conclusion as stated in the bhagavad gt antavanta ime deh that these material bodies are perishable in due course of time nityasyokt arria but that soul is eternal then we must remember always that the body is like a dress therefore why lament the changing of a dress the material body has no factual existence in relation to the eternal soul it is something like a dream in a dream we may think of flying in the sky or sitting on a chariot as a king but when we wake up we can see that we are neither in the sky nor seated on the chariot the vedic wisdom encourages selfrealization on the basis of the nonexistence of the material body therefore in either case whether one believes in the existence of the soul or one does not believe in the existence of the soul there is no cause for lamentation for loss of the body text 29 caryavat payati kacid enam caryavad vadati tathaiva cnya caryavac cainam

also find this passage in the kaha upaniad ravaypi bahubhir yo na labhya vanto pi bahavo ya na vidyu caryo vakt kualo sya labdh caryo jt kualnuia the fact that the atomic soul is within the body of a gigantic animal in the body of a gigantic banyan tree and also in the microbic germs millions and billions of which occupy only an inch of space is certainly very amazing men with a poor fund of knowledge and men who are not austere cannot understand the wonders of the individual atomic spark of spirit even though it is explained by the greatest authority of knowledge who imparted lessons even to brahm the first living being in the universe owing to a gross material conception of things most men in this age cannot imagine how such a small particle can become both so great and so small so men look at the soul proper as wonderful either by constitution or by description illusioned by the material energy people are so engrossed in subject matter for sense gratification that they have very little time to understand the question of selfunderstanding even though it is a fact that without this selfunderstanding all activities result in ultimate defeat in the struggle for existence perhaps one has no idea that one must think of the soul and also make a solution of the material miseries some people who are inclined to hear about the soul may be attending lectures in good association but sometimes owing to ignorance they are misguided by acceptance of the supersoul and the atomic soul as one without distinction of magnitude it is very difficult to find a man who perfectly understands the position of the soul the supersoul the atomic soul their respective functions relationships and all other major and minor details and it is still more difficult to find a man who has actually derived full benefit from knowledge of the soul and who is able to describe the position of the soul in different aspects but if somehow or other one is able to understand the subject matter of the soul then ones life is successful the easiest process for understanding the subject matter of self however is to accept the statements of the bhagavadgt spoken by the greatest authority lord ka without being deviated by other theories but it also requires a great deal of penance and sacrifice either in this life or in the previous ones before one is able to accept ka as the supreme personality of godhead ka can however be known as such by the causeless mercy of the pure devotee and by no other way text 30 deh nityam avadhyo ya dehe sarvasya bhrata tasmt sarvi bhtni na tva ocitum

one has to believe that there is a soul different from the material body not that there is no such thing as soul or that living symptoms develop at a certain stage of material maturity resulting from

harm is called katriya trayateto give protection the katriyas are trained for killing in the forest a katriya would go into the forest and challenge a tiger face to face and fight with the tiger with his sword when the tiger was killed it would be offered the royal order of cremation this system is being followed even up to the present day by the katriya kings of jaipur state the katriyas are specially trained for challenging and killing because religious violence is sometimes a necessary factor therefore katriyas are never meant for accepting directly the order of sannysa or renunciation nonviolence in politics may be a diplomacy but it is never a factor or principle in the religious law books it is stated haveu mitho nyonya jighsanto mahkita yuddhamn para akty svarga ynty aparmukh

heavenly planets after death as the brhmaas also attain the heavenly planets by sacrificing animals in the sacrificial fire therefore killing on the battle on the religious principle and the killing of animals in the sacrificial fire are not at all considered to be acts of violence because everyone is benefitted by the religious principles involved the animal sacrificed gets a human life immediately without undergoing the gradual evolutionary process from one form to another and the katriyas killed in the battlefield also attain the heavenly planets as do the brhmaas who attain them by offering sacrifice there are two kinds of svadharmas specific duties as long as one is not liberated one has to perform the duties of that particular body in accordance with religious principles in order to achieve liberation when one is liberated ones svadharmaspecific dutybecomes spiritual and is not in the material bodily concept in the bodily conception of life thereare specific duties for the brhmaas and katriyas respectively and such duties are unavoidable svadharma is ordained by the lord and this will be clarified in the fourth chapter on the bodily plane svadharma is called varramadharma or mans steppingstone for spiritual understanding human civilization begins from the stage of varramadharma or specific duties in terms of the specific modes of nature of the body

were due to ignorance only he wanted to become nonviolent in the discharge of his specific duty for a katriya to be in the battlefield and to become nonviolent is the philosophy of fools in the pararasmti or religious codes made by parara the great sage and father of vysadeva it is stated katriyo hi praj rakan astrapi pradaayan nirjitya parasainydi kiti dharmea playet the katriyas duty is to protect the citizens from all kinds of difficulties and for that reason he has to apply violence in suitable cases for law and order therefore he has to conquer the soldiers of inimical kings and thus with religious principles he should rule over the world considering all aspects arjuna had no reason to refrain from fighting if he should conquer his enemies he would enjoy the kingdom and if he should die in the battle he would be elevated to the heavenly planets whose doors were wide open to him fighting would be for his benefit in either case text 33 atha cet tvam ima dharmya sagrma na

a hunter arjuna pleased the lord and received as a reward a weapon called pupata astra everyone knew that he was a great warrior even drocrya gave him benediction and awarded him the special weapon by which he could kill even his teacher so he was credited with so many military certificates from many authorities including his adopted father indra the heavenly king but if he abandoned the battle he

do better to die in the battle for a respectable man like you ill fame is worse than death so you should not flee for fear of your life better to die in the battle that will save you from the ill fame

desires the battle there is no consideration of happiness or distress profit or gain victory or defeat in the activities of ka consciousness that everything should be performed for the sake of ka is transcendental consciousness so there is no reaction to material activities he who acts for his own sense gratification either in goodness or in passion is subject to the reaction good or bad but he who has completely surrendered himself in the activities of ka consciousness is no longer obliged to anyone nor is he a debtor to anyone as one is in the ordinary course of activities it is said devaribhtptan pit na kikaro nyam ca rjan sarvtman ya araa araya gato mukunda parihtya kartam bhg 11541 anyone who has completely surrendered unto ka mukunda giving up all other duties is no longer a debtor nor is he obliged to anyonenot the demigods nor the sages nor the people in general nor kinsmen nor humanity nor forefathers that is the indirect hint given by ka to arjuna in this verse and the matter will be more clearly explained in the following verses text 39 e te bhihit skhye buddhir yoge tv im u buddhy yukto yay prtha karmabandha prahsyasi eall these teunto you abhihitdescribed

describes phenomena in detail and sakhya refers to that philosophy which describes the real nature of the soul and yoga involves controlling the senses arjunas proposal not to fight was based on sense gratification forgetting his prime duty he wanted to cease fighting because he thought that by not killing his relatives and kinsmen he would be happier than by enjoying the kingdom by conquering his cousins and brothers the sons of dhtarra in both ways the basic principles were for sense gratification happiness derived from conquering them and happiness derived by seeing kinsmen alive are both on the basis of personal sense gratification for there is a sacrifice of wisdom and duty ka therefore wanted to explain to arjuna that by killing the body of his grandfather he would not be killing the soul proper and he explained that all individual persons including the lord himself are eternal individuals they were individuals in the past they are individuals in the present and they will continue to remain individuals in the future because all of us are individual souls eternally and we simply change our bodily dress in different manners but actually we keep our individuality even after liberation from the bondage of material dress an analytical study of the soul and the body has been very graphically explained by lord ka and this descriptive knowledge of the soul and the body from different angles of vision has been described here as skhya in terms of the nirukti dictionary this skhya has nothing to do with the skhya philosophy of the atheist kapila long before the imposter kapilas skhya the skhya philosophy was expounded in the rmadbhgavatam by the true lord kapila the incarnation of lord ka who explained it to his mother devahti it is clearly explained by him that the purua or the supreme lord is active and that he creates by looking over the prakti this is accepted in the vedas and in the gt the description in the vedas indicates that the lord glanced over the prakti or nature and impregnated it with atomic individuals souls all these individuals are working in the material world for sense gratification and under the spell of material energy they are thinking of being enjoyers this mentality is dragged to the last point of liberation when the living entity wants to become one with the lord this is the last snare of my or sense gratificatory illusion and it is only after many many births of such sense gratificatory activities that a great soul surrenders unto vsudeva lord ka thereby fulfilling the search after the ultimate truth arjuna has already accepted ka as his spiritual master by surrendering himself unto him iyas te ha dhi m tv prapannam consequently ka will now tell him about the working process in buddhiyoga or karmayoga or in other words the practice of devotional service only for the sense gratification of the lord this buddhiyoga is clearly explained in chapter ten verse ten as being direct communion with the lord who is sitting as paramtm in everyones heart but such communion does not take place without devotional service one who is therefore situated in devotional or transcendental loving service to the lord or in other words in ka consciousness attains to this stage of buddhiyoga by the special grace of the lord the lord says therefore that only to those who are always engaged in devotional service out of transcendental love does he award the pure knowledge of devotion in love in that way the devotee can reach him easily in the everblissful kingdom of god thus the buddhiyoga mentioned in this verse is the devotional service of the lord and the word skhya mentioned herein has nothing to do with the atheistic skhyayoga enunciated by the impostor kapila one should not therefore misunderstand that the skhyayoga mentioned herein has any connection with the atheistic skhya nor did that philosophy have any influence during that time nor would lord ka care to mention such godless philosophical speculations real skhya philosophy is described by lord kapila in the rmadbhgavatam but even that skhya has nothing to do with the current topics here skhya means analytical description of the body and the soul lord ka made an analytical description of the soul just to bring arjuna to the point of buddhiyoga or bhaktiyoga therefore lord kas skhya and lord kapilas skhya as described in the bhgavatam are one and the same they are all bhaktiyoga he said therefore that only the less intelligent class of men make a distinction between skhyayoga and bhaktiyoga of course atheistic skhyayoga has nothing to do with bhaktiyoga yet the unintelligent claim that the atheistic skhyayoga is referred to in the bhagavadgt one should therefore understand that buddhiyoga means to work in ka consciousness in the full bliss and knowledge of devotional service one who works for the satisfaction of the lord only however difficult such work may be is working under the principles of buddhiyoga and finds himself always in transcendental bliss by such transcendental engagement one achieves all transcendental qualities automatically by the grace of the lord and thus his liberation is complete in itself without his making extraneous endeavors to acquire knowledge there is much difference between work in ka consciousness and work for fruitive results especially in the matter of sense gratification for achieving results in terms of family or material happiness buddhiyoga is therefore the transcendental quality of the work that we perform text 40 nehbhikramano sti pratyavyo na

asyaof this dharmasyaof this occupation tryatereleases mahataof very great bhaytfrom danger translation in this endeavor there is no loss or diminution and a little advancement on this path can protect one from the most dangerous type of fear purport activity in ka consciousness or acting for the benefit of ka without expectation of sense gratification is the highest transcendental quality of work even a small beginning of such activity finds no impediment nor can that small beginning be lost at any stage any work begun on the material plane has to be completed otherwise the whole attempt becomes a failure but any work begun in ka consciousness has a permanent effect even though not finished the performer of such work is therefore not at a loss even if his work in ka consciousness is incomplete one percent done in ka consciousness bears permanent results so that the next beginning is from the point of two percent whereas in material activity without a hundred percent success there is no profit ajmila performed his duty in some percentage of ka consciousness but the result he enjoyed at the end was a hundred percent by the grace of the lord there is a nice verse in this connection in rmad bhgavatam tyaktv svadharma carambuja harer bhajan na pakko tha patet tato yadi yatra kva vbhadram abhd amuya ki ko vrtha pto bhajat svadharmata if someone gives up selfgratificatory pursuits and works in ka consciousness and then falls down on account of not completing his work what loss is there on his part and what can one gain if one performs his material activities perfectly bhg 1517 or as the christians say what profiteth a man if he gain the whole world yet suffers the loss of his eternal soul material activities and their results end with the body but work in ka consciousness carries the person again to ka consciousness even after the loss of the body at least one is sure to have a chance in the next life of being born again as a human being either in the family of a great cultured brhmaa or in a rich aristocratic family that will give one a further chance for elevation that is the unique quality of work done in ka consciousness text 41

life is called vyavasytmik intelligence the caitanyacaritmta states raddhabde vivsa kahe sudha nicaya ke bhakti kaile sarvakarma kta haya faith means unflinching trust in something sublime when one is engaged in the duties of ka consciousness he need not act in relationship to the material world with obligations to family traditions humanity or nationality fruitive activities are the engagements of ones reactions from past good or bad deeds when one is awake in ka consciousness he need no longer endeavor for good results in his activities when one is situated in ka consciousness all activities are on the absolute plane for they are no longer subject to dualities like good and bad the highest perfection of ka consciousness is renunciation of the material conception of life this state is automatically achieved by progressive ka consciousness the resolute purpose of a person in ka consciousness is based on knowledge vsudeva sarvam iti sa mahtm sudurlabha by which one comes to know perfectly that vsudeva or ka is the root of all manifested causes as water on the root of a tree is automatically distributed to the leaves and branches in ka consciousness one can render the highest service to everyonenamely self family society country humanity etc if ka is satisfied by ones actions then everyone will be satisfied service in ka consciousness is however best practiced under the able guidance of a spiritual master who is a bona fide representative of ka who knows the nature of the student and who can guide him to act in ka consciousness as such to be wellversed in ka consciousness one has to act firmly and obey the representative of ka and one should accept the instruction of the bona fide spiritual master as ones mission in life rla vivantha cakravart hkur instructs us in his famous prayers for the spiritual master as follows yasya prasdd bhagavatprasdo yasyprasdnna gati kuto pi dhyya stuvas tasya yaas trisandhya vande guro rcararavindam by satisfaction of the spiritual master the supreme personality of godhead becomes satisfied and by not satisfying the spiritual master there is no chance of being promoted to the plane of ka consciousness i should therefore meditate and pray for his mercy three times a day and offer my respectful obeisances unto him my spiritual master the whole process however depends on perfect knowledge of the soul beyond the conception of the bodynot theoretically but practically when there is no longer chance for sense gratification manifested in fruitive activities one who is not firmly fixed in mind is diverted by various types of fruitive acts texts 4243 ym im pupit vca pravadanty avipacita vedavdarat prtha nnyad astti vdina kmtmna svargapar janmakarmaphalapradm kriyvieabahul bhogaivaryagati prati ym immall

fruitive activities for elevation to heavenly planets resultant good birth power and so forth being desirous of sense gratification and opulent life they say that there is nothing more than this purport people in general are not very intelligent and due to their ignorance they are most attached to the fruitive activities recommended in the karmaka portions of the vedas they do not want anything more than sense gratificatory proposals for enjoying life in heaven where wine and women are available and material opulence is very common in the vedas many sacrifices are recommended for elevation to the heavenly planets especially the jyotioma sacrifices in fact it is stated that anyone desiring elevation to heavenly planets must perform these sacrifices and men with a poor fund of knowledge think that this is the whole purpose of vedic wisdom it is very difficult for such inexperienced persons to be situated in the determined action of ka consciousness as fools are attached to the flowers of poisonous trees without knowing the results of such attractions similarly unenlightened men are attracted by such heavenly opulence and the sense enjoyment thereof in the karmaka section of the vedas it is said that those who perform the four monthly penances become eligible to drink the somarasa beverages to become immortal and happy forever even on this earth some are very eager to have somarasa to become strong and fit to enjoy sense gratifications such persons have no faith in liberation from material bondage and they are very much attached to the pompous ceremonies of vedic sacrifices they are generally sensual and they do not want anything other than the heavenly pleasures of life it is understood that there are gardens called nandanaknana in which there is good opportunity for association with angelic beautiful women and having a profuse supply of somarasa wine such bodily happiness is certainly sensual therefore there are those who are purely attached to material temporary happiness as lords of the material world text 44 bhogaivaryaprasaktn taypahtacetasm vyavasytmik buddhi samdhau na vidhyate bhogamaterial enjoyment aivaryaopulence prasaktnmthose

lord does not take place purport samdhi means fixed mind the vedic dictionary the nirukti says samyag dhyate sminn tmatattvaythtmyam when the mind is fixed for understanding the self it is called samdhi samdhi is never possible for persons interested in material sense enjoyment nor for those who are bewildered by such temporary things they are more or less condemned by the process of material

transcendental to all of them be free from all dualities and from all anxieties for gain and safety and be established in the self purport all material activities involve actions and reactions in the three modes of material nature they are meant for fruitive results which cause bondage in the material world the vedas deal mostly with fruitive activities to gradually elevate the general public from the field of sense gratification to a position on the transcendental plane arjuna as a student and friend of lord ka is advised to raise himself to the transcendental position of vednta philosophy where in the beginning there is brahmajijs or questions on the supreme transcendence all the living entities who are in the material world are struggling very hard for existence for them the lord after creation of the material world gave the vedic wisdom advising how to live and get rid of the material entanglement when the activities for sense gratification namely the karmaka chapter are finished then the chance for spiritual realization is offered in the form of the upaniads which are part of different vedas as the bhagavadgt is a part of the fifth veda namely the mahbhrata the upaniads mark the beginning of transcendental life as long as the material body exists there are actions and reactions in the material modes one has to learn tolerance in the face of dualities such as happiness and distress or cold and warmth and by tolerating such dualities become free from anxieties regarding gain and loss this transcendental position is achieved in full ka consciousness when one is fully dependant on the good will of ka text 46 yvn artha udapne sarvata samplutodake tvn sarveu vedeu brhmaasya vijnata yvnall that arthais meant udapnein a well of water sarvata in all respects

all purposes that are served by the small pond can at once be served by the great reservoirs of water similarly all the purposes of the vedas can be served to one who knows the purpose behind them purport the rituals and sacrifices mentioned in the karmaka division of the vedic literature are to encourage gradual development of selfrealization and the purpose of selfrealization is clearly stated in the fifteenth chapter of the bhagavadgt 1515 the purpose of studying the vedas is to know lord ka the primeval cause of everything so selfrealization means understanding ka and ones eternal relationship with him the relationship of the living entities with ka is also mentioned in the fifteenth chapter of bhagavadgt the living entities are parts and parcels of ka therefore revival of ka consciousness by the individual living entity is the highest perfectional stage of vedic knowledge this is confirmed in the rmadbhgavatam 3337 as follows aho bata vapacoto garyn yajjihvgre vartate nma tubhyam tepus tapas te juhuvu sasnur ry brahmncur nma ganti ye te o my lord a person who is chanting your holy name although born of a low family like that of a cla dog eater is situated on the highest platform of selfrealization such a person must have performed all kinds of penances and sacrifices according to vedic rituals and studied the vedic literatures many many times after taking his bath in all the holy places of pilgrimage such a person is considered to be the best of the ryan family so one must be intelligent enough to understand the purpose of the vedas without being attached to the rituals only and must not desire to be elevated to the heavenly kingdoms for a better quality of sense gratification it is not possible for the common man in this age to follow all the rules and regulations of the vedic rituals and the injunctions of the vedntas and the upaniads it requires much time energy knowledge and resources to execute the purposes of the vedas this is hardly possible in this age the best purpose of vedic culture is served however by chanting the holy name of the lord as recommended by lord caitanya the deliverer of all fallen souls when lord caitanya was asked by a great vedic scholar praknanda sarasvat why he the lord was chanting the holy name of the lord like a sentimentalist instead of studying vednta philosophy the lord replied that his spiritual master found him to be a great fool and thus he asked him to chant the holy name of lord ka he did so and became ecstatic like a madman in this age of kali most of the population is foolish and not adequately educated to understand vednta philosophy the best purpose of vednta philosophy is served by inoffensively chanting the holy name of the lord vednta is the last word in vedic wisdom and the author and knower of the vednta philosophy is lord ka and the highest vedantist is the great soul who takes pleasure in chanting the holy name of the lord that is the ultimate purpose of all vedic mysticism text 47 karmay evdhikras te m phaleu kadcana m karmaphalahetur bhr m te sago stv akarmai karmaiprescribed duties evacertainly adhikraright teof you mnever phaleuin the fruits kadcanaat any

are not entitled to the fruits of action never consider yourself to be the cause of the results of your activities and never be attached to not doing your duty purport there are three considerations here prescribed duties capricious work and inaction prescribed duties refer to activities performed while one is in the modes of material nature capricious work means actions without the sanction of authority and inaction means not performing ones prescribed duties the lord advised that arjuna not be inactive but that he perform his prescribed duty without being attached to the result one who is attached to the result of his work is also the cause of the action thus he is the enjoyer or sufferer of the result of such actions as far as prescribed duties are concerned they can be fitted into three subdivisions namely routine work emergency work and desired activities routine work in terms of the scriptural injunctions is done without desire for results as one has to do it obligatory work is action in the mode of goodness work with results becomes the cause of bondage therefore such work is not auspicious everyone has his proprietory right in regard to prescribed duties but should act without attachment to the result such disinterested obligatory duties doubtlessly lead one to the path of liberation arjuna was therefore advised by the lord to fight as a matter of duty without attachment to the result his nonparticipation in the battle is another side of attachment such attachment never leads one to the path of salvation any attachment positive or negative is cause for bondage inaction is sinful therefore fighting as a matter of duty was the only auspicious path of salvation for arjuna text 48 yogastha kuru karmi saga tyaktv dhanajaya siddhyasiddhyo samo bhtv

purport ka tells arjuna that he should act in yoga and what is that yoga yoga means to concentrate the mind upon the supreme by controlling the everdisturbing senses and who is the supreme the supreme is the lord and because he himself is telling arjuna to fight arjuna has nothing to do with the results of the fight gain or victory are kas concern arjuna is simply advised to act according to the dictation of ka the following of kas dictation is real yoga and this is practiced in the process called ka consciousness by ka consciousness only can one give up the sense of proprietorship one has to become the servant of ka or the servant of the servant of ka that is the right way to discharge duty in ka consciousness which alone can help one to act in yoga arjuna is a katriya and as such he is participating in the varramadharma institution it is said in the viu puraa that in the varramadharma the whole aim is to satisfy viu no one should satisfy himself as is the rule in the material world but one should satisfy ka so unless one satisfies ka one cannot correctly observe the principles of varramadharma indirectly arjuna was advised to act as ka told him text 49 drea hy avara karma

constitutional position as the eternal servitor of the lord gives up all engagements save working in ka consciousness as already explained buddhiyoga means transcendental loving service to the lord such devotional service is the right course of action for the living entity only misers desire to enjoy the fruit of their own work just to be further entangled in material bondage except for work in ka consciousness all activities are abominable because they continually bind the worker to the cycle of birth and death one should therefore never desire to be the cause of work everything should be done in ka consciousness for the satisfaction of ka misers do not know how to utilize the assets of riches which they acquire by good fortune or by hard labor one should spend all energies working in ka consciousness and that will make ones life successful like the misers unfortunate persons do not employ their human energy in the service of the lord text 50 buddhiyukto jahtha ubhe suktadukte

even in this life therefore strive for yoga o arjuna which is the art of all work purport since time immemorial each living entity has accumulated the various reactions of his good and bad work as such he is continuously ignorant of his real constitutional position ones ignorance can be removed by the instruction of the bhagavadgt which teaches one to surrender unto lord r ka in all respects and become liberated from the chained victimization of action and reaction birth after birth arjuna is therefore advised to act in ka consciousness the purifying process of resultant action text 51

beyond all miseries purport the liberated living entities seek that place where there are no material miseries the bhgavatam says samrit ye padapallavaplava mahatpada puyayao murre bhvambudhir vatsapada para pada para pada yad vipad na tem bhg 101458 for one who has accepted the boat of the lotus feet of the lord who is the shelter of the cosmic manifestation and is famous as mukunda or the giver of mukti the ocean of the material world is like the water contained in a calfs hoofprint param padam or the place where there are no material miseries or vaikuha is his goal not the place where there is danger in every step of life owing to ignorance one does not know that this material world is a miserable place where there are dangers at every step out of ignorance only less intelligent persons try to adjust to the situation by fruitive activities thinking that resultant actions will make them happy they do not know that no kind of material body anywhere within the universe can give life without miseries the miseries of life namely birth death old age and diseases are present everywhere within the material world but one who understands his real constitutional position as the eternal servitor of the lord and thus knows the position of the personality of godhead engages himself in the transcendental loving service of the lord consequently he becomes qualified to enter into the vaikuha planets where there is neither material miserable life nor the influence of time and death to know ones constitutional position means to know also the sublime position of the lord one who wrongly thinks that the living entitys position and the lords position are on the same level is to be understood to be in darkness and therefore unable to engage himself in the devotional service of the lord he becomes a lord himself and thus paves the way for the repetition of birth and death but one who understanding that his position is to serve transfers himself to the service of the lord at once becomes eligible for vaikuhaloka service for the cause of the lord is called karmayoga or buddhiyoga or in plain words devotional service to the lord text 52 yad te mohakalila buddhir

shall go nirvedamcallousness rotavyasya all that is to be heard rutasyaall that is already heard caalso translation when your intelligence has passed out of the dense forest of delusion you shall become indifferent to all that has been heard and all that is to be heard purport there are many good examples in the lives of the great devotees of the lord of those who became indifferent to the rituals of the vedas simply by devotional service to the lord when a person factually understands ka and his relationship with ka he naturally becomes completely indifferent to the rituals of fruitive activities even though an experienced brhmaa r mdhavendra pur a great devotee and crya in the line of the devotees says sandhyvandana bhadram astu bhavato bho snna tubhya namo bho dev pitara ca

obeisances unto you o demigods o forefathers please excuse me for my inability to offer you my respects now wherever i sit i can remember the great descendant of the yadu dynasty ka the enemy of kasa and thereby i can free myself from all sinful bondage i think this is sufficient for me the vedic rites and rituals are imperative for neophytes comprehending all kinds of prayer three times a day taking a bath early in the morning offering respects to the forefathers etc but when one is fully in ka consciousness and is engaged in his transcendental loving service one becomes indifferent to all these regulative principles because he has already attained perfection if one can reach the platform of understanding by service to the supreme lord ka he has no longer to execute different types of penances and sacrifices as recommended in revealed scriptures and similarly if one has not understood that the purpose of the vedas is to reach ka and simply engages in the rituals etc then he is uselessly wasting time in such engagements persons in ka consciousness transcend the limit of abdabrahma or the range of the vedas and upaniads text 53 rutivipratipann te yad sthsyati nical samdhv

realized ka consciousness that is one in full samdhi has realized brahman paramtm and bhagavn the highest perfection of selfrealization is to understand that one is eternally the servitor of ka and that ones only business is to discharge ones duties in ka consciousness a ka conscious person or unflinching devotee of the lord should not be disturbed by the flowery language of the vedas nor be engaged in fruitive activities for promotion to the heavenly kingdom in ka consciousness one comes directly into communion with ka and thus all directions from ka may be understood in that transcendental state one is sure to achieve results by such activities and attain conclusive knowledge one has only to carry out the orders of ka or his representative the spiritual master text 54

one whose consciousness is thus merged in transcendence how does he speak and what is his language how does he sit and how does he walk purport as there are symptoms for each and every man in terms of his particular situation similarly one who is ka conscious has his particular nature talking walking thinking feeling etc as a rich man has his symptoms by which he is known as a rich man as a diseased man has his symptoms by which he is known as diseased or as a learned man has his symptoms so a man in transcendental consciousness of ka has specific symptoms in various dealings one can know his specific symptoms from the bhagavadgt most important is how the man in ka consciousness speaks for speech is the most important quality of any man it is said that a fool is undiscovered as long as he does not speak and certainly a welldressed fool cannot be identified unless he speaks but as soon as he speaks he reveals himself at once the immediate symptom of a ka conscious man is that he speaks only of ka and of matters relating to him other symptoms then automatically follow as stated below text 55 rbhagavn uvca prajahti yad kmn sarvn prtha manogatn tmany evtman tua sthitaprajas

a man gives up all varieties of sense desire which arise from mental concoction and when his mind finds satisfaction in the self alone then he is said to be in pure transcendental consciousness purport the bhgavatam affirms that any person who is fully in ka consciousness or devotional service of the lord has all the good qualities of the great sages whereas a person who is not so transcendentally situated has no good qualifications because he is sure to be taking refuge in his own mental concoctions consequently it is rightly said herein that one has to give up all kinds of sense desire manufactured by mental concoction artificially such sense desires cannot be stopped but if one is engaged in ka consciousness then automatically sense desires subside without extraneous efforts therefore one has to engage himself in ka consciousness without hesitation for this devotional service will instantly help one on to the platform of transcendental consciousness the highly developed soul always remains satisfied in himself by realizing himself as the eternal servitor of the supreme lord such a transcendentally situated person has no sense desires resulting from petty materialism rather he remains always happy in his natural position of eternally serving the supreme lord text 56 dukhev anudvignaman sukheu vigataspha vtargabhayakrodha sthitadhr munir ucyate dukheuin

munisage ucyateis called translation one who is not disturbed in spite of the threefold miseries who is not elated when there is happiness and who is free from attachment fear and anger is called a sage of steady mind purport the word muni means one who can agitate his mind in various ways for mental speculation without coming to a factual conclusion it is said that every muni has a different angle of vision and unless a muni differs from other munis he cannot be called a muni in the strict sense of the term nsau munir yasya mata na binnam but a sthitadhmuni as mentioned herein by the lord is different from an ordinary muni the sthitadhmuni is always in ka consciousness for he has exhausted all his business of creative speculation he has surpassed the stage of mental speculations and has come to the conclusion that lord r ka or vsudeva is everything he is called a muni fixed in mind such a fully ka conscious person is not at all disturbed by the onslaughts of the threefold miseries for he accepts all miseries as the mercy of the lord thinking himself only worthy of more trouble due to his past misdeeds and he sees that his miseries by the grace of the lord are minimized to the lowest similarly when he is happy he gives credit to the lord thinking himself unworthy of the happiness he realizes that it is due only to the lords grace that he is in such a comfortable condition and able to render better service to the lord and for the service of the lord he is always daring and active and is not influenced by attachment or aversion attachment means accepting things for ones own sense gratification and detachment is the absence of such sensual attachment but one fixed in ka consciousness has neither attachment nor detachment because his life is dedicated in the service of the lord consequently he is not at all angry even when his attempts are unsuccessful a ka conscious person is always steady in his determination text 57 ya sarvatrnabhisnehas tat tat prpya

knowledge purport there is always some upheaval in the material world which may be good or evil one who is not agitated by such material upheavals who is unaffected by good and evil is to be understood to be fixed in ka consciousness as long as one is in the material world there is always the possibility of good and evil because this world is full of duality but one who is fixed in ka consciousness is not affected by good and evil because he is simply concerned with ka who is all good absolute such consciousness in ka situates one in a perfect transcendental position called technically samdhi text 58 yad saharate cya krmo gnva sarvaa indriyndriyrthebhyas tasya praj pratihit yadwhen saharatewinds up caalso ayamall these krma tortoise agnilimbs ivalike sarvaaaltogether indriyni senses indriyaarthebhyafrom the sense objects tasyahis praj consciousness pratihitfixed up translation one who is able to withdraw his senses from sense objects as the tortoise draws his limbs within the shell is to be understood as truly situated in knowledge purport the test of a yog devotee or selfrealized soul is that he is able to control the senses according to his plan most people however are servants of the senses and are thus directed by the dictation of the senses that is the answer to the question as to how the yog is situated the senses are compared to venomous serpents they want to act very loosely and without restriction the yog or the devotee must be very strong to control the serpentslike a snake charmer he never allows them to act independently there are many injunctions in the revealed scriptures some of them are donots and some of them are dos unless one is able to follow the dos and the donots restricting oneself from sense enjoyment it is not possible to be firmly fixed in ka consciousness the best example set herein is the tortoise the tortoise can at any moment wind up his senses and exhibit them again at any time for particular purposes similarly the senses of the ka conscious persons are used only for some particular purpose in the service of the lord and are withdrawn otherwise keeping the senses always in the service of the lord is the example set by the analogy of the tortoise who keeps the senses within text 59 viay vinivartante nirhrasya dehina rasavarja raso py asya para dv nivartate viayobjects for sense enjoyment

superior things dvby experiencing nivartateceases from translation the embodied soul may be restricted from sense enjoyment though the taste for sense objects remains but ceasing such engagements by experiencing a higher taste he is fixed in consciousness purport unless one is transcendentally situated it is not possible to cease from sense enjoyment the process of restriction from sense enjoyment by rules and regulations is something like restricting a diseased person from certain types of eatables the patient however neither likes such restrictions nor loses his taste for eatables similarly sense restriction by some spiritual process like agayoga in the matter of yama niyama sana pryma pratyhra dhara dhyna etc is recommended for less intelligent persons who have no better knowledge but one who has tasted the beauty of the supreme lord ka in the course of his advancement in ka consciousness no longer has a taste for dead material things therefore restrictions are there for the less intelligent neophytes in the spiritual advancement of life but such restrictions are only good if one actually has a taste for ka consciousness when one is actually ka conscious he automatically loses his taste for pale things text 60 yatato hy api kaunteya puruasya vipacita indriyi pramthni haranti prasabha mana yatatawhile endeavoring hicertainly apiin spite of kaunteyao son

impetuous o arjuna that they forcibly carry away the mind even of a man of discrimination who is endeavoring to control them purport there are many learned sages philosophers and transcendentalists who try to conquer the senses but in spite of their endeavors even the greatest of them sometimes fall victim to material sense enjoyment due to the agitated mind even vivmitra a great sage and perfect yog was misled by menak into sex enjoyment although the yog was endeavoring for sense control with severe types of penance and yoga practice andof course there are so many similar instances in the history of the world therefore it is very difficult to control the mind and the senses without being fully ka conscious without engaging the mind in ka one cannot cease such material engagements a practical example is given by r ymuncrya a great saint and devotee who says since my mind has been engaged in the service of the lotus feet of lord ka and i have been enjoying an ever new transcendental humor whenever i think of sex life with a woman my face at once turns from it and i spit at the thought ka consciousness is such a transcendentally nice thing that automatically material enjoyment becomes distasteful it is as if a hungry man had satisfied his hunger by a sufficient quantity of nutritious eatables mahrja ambara also conquered a great yog durvs muni simply because his mind was engaged in ka consciousness text 61 tni sarvi sayamya yukta sta matpara vae hi yasyendriyi tasya praj pratihit tnithose senses sarviall sayamyakeeping under control yuktabeing

senses and fixes his consciousness upon me is known as a man of steady intelligence purport that the highest conception of yoga perfection is ka consciousness is clearly explained in this verse and unless one is ka conscious it is not at all possible to control the senses as cited above the great sage durvs muni picked a quarrel with mahrja ambara and durvs muni unnecessarily became angry out of pride and therefore could not check his senses on the other hand the king although not as powerful a yog as the sage but a devotee of the lord silently tolerated all the sages injustices and thereby emerged victorious the king was able to control his senses because of the following qualifications as mentioned in the rmadbhgavatam sa vai mana kapadravindayor vacsi vaikuhagunavarane karau harer

kma ca dsye na tu kmakmyay yathottamalokajanray rati king ambara fixed his mind on the lotus feet of lord ka engaged his words in describing the abode of the lord his hands in cleansing the temple of the lord his ears in hearing the pastimes of the lord his eyes in seeing the form of the lord his body in touching the body of the devotee his nostrils in smelling the flavor of the flowers offered to the lotus feet of the lord his tongue in tasting the tulas leaves offered to him his legs in traveling to the holy place where his temple is situated his head in offering obeisances unto the lord and his desires in fulfilling the desires of the lord and all these qualifications made him fit to become a matpara devotee of the lord bhg 941820 the word matpara is most significant in this connection how one can become a matpara is described in the life of mahrja ambara rla baladeva vidybhaa a great scholar and crya in the line of the matpara remarks madbhaktiprabhvena sarvendriyavijayaprvik svtma di sulabheti bhva the senses can be completely controlled only by the strength of devotional service to ka also the example of fire is sometimes given as the small flames within burn everything within the room similarly lord viu situated in the heart of the yog burns up all kinds of impurities the yogastra also prescribes meditation on viu and not meditation on the void the socalled yogs who meditate on something which is not the viu form simply waste their time in a vain search after some phantasmagoria we have to be ka consciousdevoted to the personality of godhead this is the aim of the real yoga text 62 dhyyato viayn pusa sagas tepajyate sagt sajyate kma kmt krodho bhijyate dhyyatawhile contemplating viaynsense objects pusaof the person sagaattachment teuin the sense objects upajyate develops sagtattachment sajyatedevelops kmadesire kmtfrom desire krodhaanger abhijyatebecomes manifest translation while contemplating the objects of the senses a person develops attachment for them and from such attachment lust develops and from lust anger arises purport one who is not ka conscious is subjected to material desires while contemplating the objects of senses the senses require real engagements and if they are not engaged in the transcendental loving service of the lord they will certainly seek engagement in the service of materialism in the material world everyone including lord iva and lord brahmto say nothing of other demigods in the heavenly planetsis subjected to the influence of sense objects and the only method to get out of this puzzle of material existence is to become ka conscious lord iva was deep in meditation but when prvat agitated him for sense pleasure he agreed to the proposal and as a result krtikeya was born when haridsa hkur was a young devotee of the lord he was similarly allured by the incarnation of my dev but haridsa easily passed the test because of his unalloyed devotion to lord ka as illustrated in the abovementioned verse of r ymuncrya a sincere devotee of the lord shuns all material sense enjoyment due to his higher taste for spiritual enjoyment in the association of the lord that is the secret of success one who is not therefore in ka consciousness however powerful he may be in controlling the senses by artificial repression is sure ultimately to fail for the slightest thought of sense pleasure will agitate him to gratify his desires text 63 krodhd bhavati samoha samoht smtivibhrama smtibhrad buddhino buddhint praayati krodhtfrom anger bhavatitakes place samohaperfect illusion samohtfrom illusion

and from delusion bewilderment of memory when memory is bewildered intelligence is lost and when intelligence is lost one falls down again into the material pool purport by development of ka consciousness one can know that everything has its use in the service of the lord those who are without knowledge of ka consciousness artificially try to avoid material objects and as a result although they desire liberation from material bondage they do not attain to the perfect stage of renunciation on the other hand a person in ka consciousness knows how to use everything in the service of the lord therefore he does not become a victim of material consciousness for example for an impersonalist the lord or the absolute being impersonal cannot eat whereas an impersonalist tries to avoid good eatables a devotee knows that ka is the supreme enjoyer and that he eats all that is offered to him in devotion so after offering good eatables to the lord the devotee takes the remnants called prasdam thus everything becomes spiritualized and there is no danger of a downfall the devotee takes prasdam in ka consciousness whereas the nondevotee rejects it as material the impersonalist therefore cannot enjoy life due to his artificial renunciation and for this reason a slight agitation of the mind pulls him down again into the pool of material existence it is said that such a soul even though rising up to the point of liberation falls down again due to his not having support in devotional service text 64 rgadveavimuktais tu viayn indriyai caran tmavayair vidheytm prasdam

follows regulated freedom prasdamthe mercy of the lord adhigacchatiattains translation one who can control his senses by practicing the regulated principles of freedom can obtain the complete mercy of the lord and thus become free from all attachment and aversion purport it is already explained that one may externally control the senses by some artificial process but unless the senses are engaged in the transcendental service of the lord there is every chance of a fall although the person in full ka consciousness may apparently be on the sensual plane because of his being ka conscious he has no attachment to sensual activities the ka conscious person is concerned only with the satisfaction of ka and nothing else therefore he is transcendental to all attachment if ka wants the devotee can do anything which is ordinarily undesirable and if ka does not want he shall not do that which he would have ordinarily done for his own satisfaction therefore to act or not to act is within his control because he acts only under the direction of ka this consciousness is the causeless mercy of the lord which the devotee can achieve in spite of his being attached to the sensual platform text

a controlled mind nor steady intelligence without which there is no possibility of peace and how can there be any happiness without peace purport unless one is in ka consciousness there is no possibility of peace so it is confirmed in the fifth chapter 529 that when one understands that ka is the only enjoyer of all the good results of sacrifice and penance and that he is the proprietor of all universal manifestations that he is the real friend of all living entities then only can one have real peace therefore if one is not in ka consciousness there cannot be a final goal for the mind disturbance is due to want of an ultimate goal and when one is certain that ka is the enjoyer proprietor and friend of everyone and everything then one can with a steady mind bring about peace therefore one who is engaged without a relationship with ka is certainly always in distress and is without peace however much one may make a show of peace and spiritual advancement in life ka consciousness is a selfmanifested peaceful condition which can be achieved only in relationship with ka text 67 indriy hi carat yan mano nuvidhyate tad asya harati praj vyur nvam ivmbhasi indriymof

translation what is night for all beings is the time of awakening for the selfcontrolled and the time of awakening for all beings is night for the introspective sage purport there are two classes of intelligent men the one is intelligent in material activities for sense gratification and the other is introspective and awake to the cultivation of selfrealization activities of the introspective sage or thoughtful man are night for persons materially absorbed materialistic persons remain asleep in such a night due to their ignorance of selfrealization the introspective sage remains alert in the night of the materialistic men the sage feels transcendental pleasure in the gradual advancement of spiritual culture whereas the man in materialistic activities being asleep to selfrealization dreams of varieties of sense pleasure feeling sometimes happy and sometimes distressed in his sleeping condition the introspective man is always indifferent to materialistic happiness and distress he goes on with his selfrealization activities undisturbed by material reaction text 70 pryamam acalapratiha samudram pa pravianti yadvat tadvat km ya pravianti sarve sa ntim pnoti na kmakm pryamamalways

who desires to fulfill desires translation a person who is not disturbed by the incessant flow of desiresthat enter like rivers into the ocean which is ever being filled but is always still can alone achieve peace and not the man who strives to satisfy such desires purport although the vast ocean is always filled with water it is always especially during the rainy season being filled with much more water but the ocean remains the samesteady it is not agitated nor does it cross beyond the limit of its brink that is also true of a person fixed in ka consciousness as long as one has the material body the demands of the body for sense gratification will continue the devotee however is not disturbed by such desires because of his fullness a ka conscious man is not in need of anything because the lord fulfills all his material necessities therefore he is like the oceanalways full in himself desires may come to him like the waters of the rivers that flow into the ocean but he is steady in his activities and he is not even slightly disturbed by desires for sense gratification that is the proof of a ka conscious manone who has lost all inclinations for material sense gratification although the desires are present because he remains satisfied in the transcendental loving service of the lord he can remain steady like the ocean and therefore enjoy full peace others however who fulfill desires even up to the limit of liberation what to speak of material success never attain peace the fruitive workers the salvationists and also the yogs who are after mystic powers are all unhappy because of unfulfilled desires but the person in ka consciousness is happy in the service of the lord and he has no desires to be fulfilled in fact he does not even desire liberation from the socalled material bondage the devotees of ka have no material desires and therefore they are in perfect peace text 71 vihya kmn ya sarvn pum carati nispha nirmamo nirahakra sa ntim

without false ego saall ntimperfect peace adhigacchatiattains translation a person who has given up all desires for sense gratification who lives free from desires who has given up all sense of proprietorship and is devoid of false egohe alone can attain real peace purport to become desireless means not to desire anything for sense gratification in other words desire for becoming ka conscious is actually desirelessness to understand ones actual position as the eternal servitor of ka without falsely claiming this material body to be oneself and without falsely claiming proprietorship over anything in the world is the perfect stage of ka consciousness one who is situated in this perfect stage knows that because ka is the proprietor of everything therefore everything must be used for the satisfaction of ka arjuna did not want to fight for his own sense satisfaction but when he became fully ka conscious he fought because ka wanted him to fight for himself there was no desire to fight but for ka the same arjuna fought to his best ability desire for the satisfaction of ka is really desirelessness it is not an artificial attempt to abolish desires the living entity cannot be desireless or senseless but he does have to change the quality of the desires a materially desireless person certainly knows that everything belongs to ka vsyam ida sarvam and therefore he does not falsely claim proprietorship over anything this transcendental knowledge is based on selfrealizationnamely knowing perfectly well that every living entity is the eternal part and parcel of ka in spiritual identity and therefore the eternal position of the living entity is never on the level of ka or greater than him this understanding of ka consciousness is the basic principle of real peace text 72 e brhm sthiti prtha nain prpya vimuhyati sthitvsym antakle pi brahmanirvam cchati ethis brhmspiritual sthitisituation prthao son of pth nanever enmthis prpyaachieving vimuhyatibewilders

which a man is not bewildered being so situated even at the hour of death one can enter into the kingdom of god purport one can attain ka consciousness or divine life at once within a secondor one may not attain such a state of life even after millions of births it is only a matter of understanding and accepting the fact khavga mahrja attained this state of life just a few minutes before his death by surrendering unto ka nirva means ending the process of materialistic life according to buddhist philosophy there is only void after the completion of this material life but bhagavadgt teaches differently actual life begins after the completion of this material life for the gross materialist it is sufficient to know that one has to end this materialistic way of life but for persons who are spiritually advanced there is another life after this materialistic life before ending this life if one fortunately becomes ka conscious he at once attains the stage of brahmanirva there is no difference between the kingdom of god and the devotional service of the lord since both of them are on the absolute plane to be engaged in the transcendental loving service of the lord is to have attained the spiritual kingdom in the material world there are activities of sense gratification whereas in the spiritual world there are activities of ka consciousness attainment of ka consciousness even during this life is immediate attainment of brahman and one who is situated in ka consciousness has certainly already entered into the kingdom of god brahman is just the opposite of matter therefore brhm sthiti means not on the platform of material activities devotional service of the lord is accepted in the bhagavad gt as the liberated stage therefore brhm sthiti is liberation from material bondage rla bhaktivinode hkur has summarized this second chapter of the bhagavadgt as being the contents for the whole text in the bhagavadgt the subject matters are karmayoga jnayoga and bhaktiyoga in the second chapter karmayoga and jnayoga have been clearly discussed and a glimpse of bhaktiyoga has also been given as the contents for the complete text thus end the bhaktivedanta purports to the second chapter of the rmadbhagavadgt in the matter of its contents bg3 chapter three karmayoga text 1 arjuna uvca jyyas cet karmaas te mat buddhir janrdana tat ki karmai ghore m

ghoreghastly mmme niyojayasiengaging me keavao ka translation arjuna said o janrdana o keava why do you urge me to engage in this ghastly warfare if you think that intelligence is better than fruitive work purport the supreme personality of godhead r ka has very elaborately described the constitution of the soul in the previous chapter with a view to deliver his intimate friend arjuna from the ocean of material grief and the path of realization has been recommended buddhiyoga or ka consciousness sometimes ka consciousness is misunderstood to be inertia and one with such a misunderstanding often withdraws to a secluded place to become fully ka conscious by chanting the holy name of lord ka but without being trained in the philosophy of ka consciousness it is not advisable to chant the holy name of ka in a secluded place where one may acquire only cheap adoration from the innocent public arjuna also thought of ka consciousness or buddhi yoga or intelligence in spiritual advancement of knowledge as something like retirement from active life and the practice of penance and austerity at a secluded place in other words he wanted to skillfully avoid the fighting by using ka consciousness as an excuse but as a sincere student he placed the matter before his master and questioned ka as to his best course of action in answer lord ka elaborately explained karmayoga or work in ka consciousness in this third chapter text 2 vymireeva vkyena buddhi mohayasva me tad eka vada nicitya yena reyo ham pnuym vymireaby equivocal ivaas vkyenawords buddhim intelligence

skhyayoga buddhiyoga control of the senses by intelligence work without fruitive desire and the position of the neophyte this was all presented unsystematically a more organized outline of the path would be necessary for action and understanding arjuna therefore wanted to clear up these apparently confusing matters so that any common man could accept them without misinterpretation although ka had no intention of confusing arjuna by any jugglery of words arjuna could not follow the process of ka consciousnesseither by inertia or active service in other words by his questions he is clearing the path of ka consciousness for all students who seriously want to understand the mystery of the bhagavadgt text 3 rbhagavn uvca loke smin dvividh nih pur prokt maynagha jnayogena skhyn karmayogena

that there are two classes of men who realize the self some are inclined to understand him by empirical philosophical speculation and others are inclined to know him by devotional work purport in the second chapter verse 39 the lord explained two kinds of proceduresnamely skhyayoga and karmayoga or buddhiyoga in this verse the lord explains the same more clearly skhyayoga or the analytical study of the nature of spirit and matter is the subject matter for persons who are inclined to speculate and understand things by experimental knowledge and philosophy the other class of men work in ka consciousness as it is explained in the 61st verse of the second chapter the lord has explained also in the 39th verse that by working by the principles of buddhiyoga or ka consciousness one can be relieved from the bonds of action and furthermore there is no flaw in the process the same principle is more clearly explained in the 61st versethat this buddhi yoga is to depend entirely on the supreme or more specifically on ka and in this way all the senses can be brought under control very easily therefore both the yogas are interdependant as religion and philosophy religion without philosophy is sentiment or sometimes fanaticism while philosophy without religion is mental speculation the ultimate goal is ka because the philosophers who are also sincerely searching after the absolute truth come in the end to ka consciousness this is also stated in the bhagavadgt the whole process is to understand the real position of the self in relation to the superself the indirect process is philosophical speculation by which gradually one may come to the point of ka consciousness and the other process is directly connecting with everything in ka consciousness of these two the path of ka consciousness is better because it does not depend on purifying the senses by a philosophical process ka consciousness is itself the purifying process and by the direct method of devotional service it is simultaneously easy and sublime text 4 na karmam anrambhn naikarmya puruo nute na ca sannyasand eva siddhi samadhigacchati nawithout karmamof the prescribed duties anrambhtnonperformance

achieve freedom from reaction nor by renunciation alone can one attain perfection purport the renounced order of life can be accepted upon being purified by the discharge of the prescribed form of duties which are laid down just to purify the heart of materialistic men without purification one cannot attain success by abruptly adopting the fourth order of life sannysa according to the empirical philosophers simply by adopting sannysa or retiring from fruitive activities one at once becomes as good as nryaa but lord ka does not approve this principle without purification of heart sannysa is simply a disturbance to the social order on the other hand if someone takes to the transcendental service of the lord even without discharging his prescribed duties whatever he may be able to advance in the cause is accepted by the lord buddhiyoga svalpam apy asya dharmasya tryate mahato bhayt even a slight performance of such a principle enables one to overcome great difficulties text 5 na hi

impulses born of the modes of material nature therefore no one can refrain from doing something not even for a moment purport it is not a question of embodied life but it is the nature of the soul to be always active without the presence of the spirit soul the material body cannot move the body is only a dead vehicle to be worked by the spirit soul which is always active and cannot stop even for a moment as such the spirit soul has to be engaged in the good work of ka consciousness otherwise it will be engaged in occupations dictated by illusory energy in contact with material energy the spirit soul acquires material modes and to purify the soul from such affinities it is necessary to engage in the prescribed duties enjoined in the stras but if the soul is engaged in his natural function of ka consciousness whatever he is able to do is good for him the rmad bhgavatam affirms this tyaktv svadharma carambuja harer bhajann apakvo tha patet tato yadi yatra kva vbhadram abhd amuya ki ko vrtha pto bhajat svadharmata if someone takes to ka consciousness even though he may not follow the prescribed duties in the stras nor execute the devotional service properly and even though he may fall down from the standard there is no loss or evil for him but if he carries out all the injunctions for purification in the stras what does it avail him if he is not ka conscious bhg 1517 so the purificatory process is necessary for reaching this point of ka consciousness therefore sannysa or any purificatory process is to help reach the ultimate goal of becoming ka conscious without which everything is considered a failure text 6 karmendriyi sayamya ya ste manas smaran indriyrthn vimhtm mithycra sa ucyate karmaindriyithe five working sense organs sayamya controlling yaanyone who

mind dwells on sense objects certainly deludes himself and is called a pretender purport there are many pretenders who refuse to work in ka consciousness but make a show of meditation while actually dwelling within the mind upon sense enjoyment such pretenders may also speak on dry philosophy in order to bluff sophisticated followers but according to this verse these are the greatest cheaters for sense enjoyment one can act in any capacity of the social order but if one follows the rules and regulations of his particular status he can make gradual progress in purifying his existence but he who makes a show of being a yog while actually searching for the objects of sense gratification must be called the greatest cheater even though he sometimes speaks of philosophy his knowledge has no value because the effects of such a sinful mans knowledge are taken away by the illusory energy of the lord such a pretenders mind is always impure and therefore his show of yogic meditation has no value whatsoever text 7 yas tv indriyi manas niyamyrabhate rjuna karmendriyai karmayogam asakta sa viiyate yaone who tubut indriyisenses manasby the mind niyamya regulating rabhatebegins arjunao arjuna

active organs in works of devotion without attachment is by far superior purport instead of becoming a pseudotranscendentalist for the sake of wanton living and sense enjoyment it is far better to remain in ones own business and execute the purpose of life which is to get free from material bondage and enter into the kingdom of god the prime svrthagati or goal of selfinterest is to reach viu the whole institution of vara and rama is designed to help us reach this goal of life a householder can also reach this destination by regulated service in ka consciousness for selfrealization one can live a controlled life as prescribed in the stras and continue carrying out his business without attachment and in that way make progress such a sincere person who follows this method is far better

cannot even maintain his physical body without work purport there are many pseudomeditators who misrepresent themselves as belonging to high parentage and great professional men who falsely pose that they have sacrificed everything for the sake of advancement in spiritual life lord ka did not want arjuna to become a pretender but that he perform his prescribed duties as set forth for katriyas arjuna was a householder and a military general and therefore it was better for him to remain as such and perform his religious duties as prescribed for the householder katriya such activities gradually cleanse the heart of a mundane man and free him from material contamination socalled renunciation for the purpose of maintenance is never approved by the lord nor by any religious scripture after all one has to maintain ones body and soul together by some work work should not be given up capriciously without purification of materialistic propensities anyone who is in the material world is certainly possessed of the impure propensity for lording it over material nature or in other words for sense gratification such polluted propensities have to be cleared without doing so through prescribed duties one should never attempt to become a socalled transcendentalist renouncing work and living at the cost of others text 9 yajrtht karmao nyatra loko ya karmabandhana tadartha karma

therefore o son of kunt perform your prescribed duties for his satisfaction and in that way you will always remain unattached and free from bondage purport since one has to work even for the simple maintenance of the body the prescribed duties for a particular social position and quality are so made that that purpose can be fulfilled yaja means lord viu or sacrificial performances all sacrificial performances also are meant for the satisfaction of lord viu the vedas enjoin yajo vai viu in other words the same purpose is served whether one performs prescribed yajas or directly serves lord viu ka consciousness is therefore performance of yaja as it is prescribed in this verse the varrama institution also aims at this for satisfying lord viu varramcravat puruea para pumnviur rdhyate viu pura 388 therefore one has to work for the satisfaction of viu any other work done in this material world wili be a cause of bondage for both good and evil work have their reactions and any reaction binds the performer therefore one has to work in ka consciousness to satisfy ka or viu and while performing such activities one is in a liberated stage this is the great art of doing work and in the beginning this process requires very expert guidance one should therefore act very diligently under the expert guidance of a devotee of lord ka or under the direct instruction of lord ka himself under whom arjuna had the opportunity to work nothing should be performed for sense gratification but everything should be done for the satisfaction of ka this practice will not only save one from the reaction of work but will also gradually elevate one to transcendental loving service of the lord which alone can raise one to the kingdom of god text 10 sahayaj praj sv purovca prajpati

creatures viu is a chance offered to the conditioned souls to come back homeback to godhead all living entities within the material creation are conditioned by material nature because of their forgetfulness of their relationship to ka the supreme personality of godhead the vedic principles are to help us understand this eternal relation as it is stated in the bhagavadgt vedai ca sarvair aham eva vedya the lord says that the purpose of the vedas is to understand him in the vedic hymns it is said pati vivasytmevaram therefore the lord of the living entities is the supreme personality of godhead viu in the rmadbhgavatam also rla ukadeva gosvm describes the lord as pati in so many ways riyapatir yajapati prajpatir dhiy patir lokapatir dharpati patir gati cndhakavistvat prasdat me bhagavn sat pati bhg 2420 the prajpati is lord viu and he is the lord of all living creatures all worlds and all beauties and the protector of everyone the lord created this material world for the conditioned souls to learn how to perform yajas sacrifice for the satisfaction of viu so that while in the material world they can live very comfortably without anxiety then after finishing the present material body they can enter into the kingdom of god that is the whole program for the conditioned soul by performance of yaja the conditioned souls gradually become ka conscious and become godly in all respects in this age of kali the sakrtanayaja the chanting of the names of god is recommended by the vedic scriptures and this transcendental system was introduced by lord caitanya for the deliverance of all men in this age sakrtanayaja and ka consciousness go well together lord ka in his devotional form as lord caitanya is mentioned in the rmadbhgavatam as follows with special reference to the sakrtanayaja kavara tvik sgopgstrapradam yajai sakrtanapryair yajanti hi sumedhasa in this age of kali people who are endowed with sufficient intelligence will worship the lord who is

benedictions for maintaining the body and soul of every living entity are entrusted to the demigods who are innumerable assistants in different parts of the body of the supreme personality of godhead their pleasures and displeasures are dependant on the performance of yajas by the human being some of the yajas are meant to satisfy particular demigods but even in so doing lord viu is worshiped in all yajas as the chief beneficiary it is stated also in the bhagavadgt that ka himself is the beneficiary of all kinds of yajas bhoktra yaja tapasm therefore ultimate satisfaction of the yajapati is the chief purpose of all yajas when these yajas are perfectly performed naturally the demigods in charge of the different departments of supply are pleased and there is no scarcity in the supply of natural products performance of yajas has many side benefits ultimately leading to liberation from the material bondage by performance of yajas all activities become purified as it is stated in the vedas hrauddhau sattvauddhi sattvauddhau dhruv smti smtilambhe sarvagranthn vipramoka as it will be explained in the following verse by performance of yaja ones eatables become sanctified and by eating sanctified foodstuffs ones very existence becomes purified by the purification of existence finer tissues in the memory become sanctified and when memory is sanctified one can think of the path of liberation and all these combined together lead to ka consciousness the great necessity of presentday society text 12 in bhogn hi vo dev dsyante yajabhvit tair dattn apradyaibhyo yo bhukte stena

sacrifice supply all necessities to man but he who enjoys these gifts without offering them to the demigods in return is certainly a thief purport the demigods are authorized supplying agents on behalf of the supreme personality of godhead viu therefore they must be satisfied by the performance of prescribed yajas in the vedas there are different kinds of yajas prescribed for different kinds of demigods but all are ultimately offered to the supreme personality of godhead for one who cannot understand what the personality of godhead is sacrifice to the demigods is recommended according to the different material qualities of the persons concerned different types of yajas are recommended in the vedas worship of different demigods is also on the same basisnamely according to different qualities for example the meateaters are recommended to worship the goddess kl the ghastly form of material nature and before the goddess the sacrifice of animals is recommended but for those who are in the mode of goodness the transcendental worship of viu is recommended but ultimately all yajas are meant for gradual promotion to the transcendental position for ordinary men at least five yajas known as pacamahyaja are necessary one should know however that all the necessities of life that the human society requires are supplied by the demigod agents of the lord no one can manufacture anything take for example all the eatables of human society these eatables include grains fruits vegetables milk sugar etc for the persons in the mode of goodness and also eatables for the nonvegetarians like meats etc none of which can be manufactured by men then again take for example heat light water air etc which are also necessities of lifenone of them can be manufactured by the human society without the supreme lord there can be no profuse sunlight moonlight rainfall breeze etc without which no one can live obviously our life is dependant on supplies from the lord even for our manufacturing enterprises we require so many raw materials like metal sulphur mercury manganese and so many essentialsall of which are supplied by the agents of the lord with the purpose that we should make proper use of them to keep ourselves fit and healthy for the purpose of selfrealization leading to the ultimate goal of life namely liberation from the material struggle for existence this aim of life is attained by performance of yajas if we forget the purpose of human life and simply take supplies from the agents of the lord for sense gratification and become more and more entangled in material existence which is not the purpose of creation certainly we become thieves and therefore we are punished by the laws of material nature a society of thieves can never be happy because they have no aim in life the gross materialist thieves have no ultimate goal of life they are simply directed to sense gratification nor do they have knowledge of how to perform yajas lord caitanya however inaugurated the easiest performance of yaja namely the sakrtanayaja which can be performed by anyone in the world who accepts the principles of ka consciousness text 13 yajaiina santo mucyante

offered first for sacrifice others who prepare food for personal sense enjoyment verily eat only sin purport the devotees of the supreme lord or the persons who are in ka consciousness are called santas and they are always in love with the lord as it is described in the brahmasahit premjanacchuritabhaktivilocanena santa sadaiva hdayeu vilokayanti the santas being always in a compact of love with the supreme personality of godhead govinda the giver of all pleasures or mukunda the giver of liberation or ka the all attractive person cannot accept anything without first offering it to the supreme person therefore such devotees always perform yajas in different modes of devotional service such as ravaam krtanam smaraam arcanam etc and these performances of yajas keep them always aloof from all kinds of contamination of sinful association in the material world others who prepare food for self or sense gratification are not only thieves but are also the eaters of all kinds of sins how can a person be happy if he is both a thief and sinful it is not possible therefore in order for people to become happy in all respects they must be taught to perform the easy process of sakrtanayaja in full ka consciousness otherwise there can be no peace or happiness in the world text 14 annd bhavanti bhtni parjanyd annasambhava yajd bhavati parjanyo yaja karmasamudbhava anntfrom

sampdayanti te santa sarvevarasya bhakt sarvakilviair andiklavivddhair tmnubhavapratibandhakair nikhilai ppair vimucyante the supreme lord who is known as the yajapurua or the personal beneficiary of all sacrifices is the master of all demigods who serve him as the different limbs of the body serve the whole demigods like indra candra varua etc are appointed officers who manage material affairs and the vedas direct sacrifices to satisfy these demigods so that they may be pleased to supply air light and water sufficiently to produce food grains when lord ka is worshiped the demigods who are different limbs of the lord are also automatically worshiped therefore there is no separate need to worship the demigods for this reason the devotees of the lord who are in ka consciousness offer food to ka and then eata process which nourishes the body spiritually by such action not only are past sinful reactions in the body vanquished but the body becomes immunized to all contamination of material nature when there is an epidemic disease an antiseptic vaccine protects a person from the attack of such an epidemic similarly food offered to lord viu and then taken by us makes us sufficiently resistant to material affection and one who is accustomed to this practice is called a devotee of the lord therefore a person in ka consciousness who eats only food offered to ka can counteract all reactions of past material infections which are impediments to the progress of self realization on the other hand one who does not do so continues to increase the volume of sinful action and this prepares the next body to resemble hogs and dogs to suffer the resultant reactions of all sins the material world is full of contaminations and one who is immunized by accepting prasdam of the lord food offered to viu is saved from the attack whereas one who does not do so becomes subjected to contamination food grains or vegetables are factually eatables the human being eats different kinds of food grains vegetables fruits etc and the animals eat the refuse of the food grains and vegetables grass plants etc human beings who are accustomed to eating meat and flesh must also depend on the production of vegetation in order to eat the animals therefore ultimately we have to depend on the production of the field and not on the production of big factories the field production is due to sufficient rain from the sky and such rains are controlled by demigods like indra sun moon etc and they are all servants of the lord the lord can be satisfied by sacrifices therefore one who cannot perform them will find himself in scarcitythat is the law of nature yaja specifically the sakrtanayaja prescribed for this age must therefore be performed to save us at least from scarcity of food supply text 15 karma brahmodbhava viddhi brahmkarasamudbhavam tasmt sarvagata brahma nitya yaje pratihitam karmawork brahmavedas udbhavamproduced from viddhione should know

transcendence is eternally situated in acts of sacrifice purport yajrtha karma or the necessity of work for the satisfaction of ka only is more expressly stated in this verse if we have to work for the satisfaction of the yajapurua viu then we must find out the direction of work in brahman or the transcendental vedas the vedas are therefore codes of working directions anything performed without the direction of the vedas is called vikarma or unauthorized or sinful work therefore one should always take direction from the vedas to be saved from the reaction of work as one has to work in ordinary life by the direction of the state similarly one has to work under direction of the supreme state of the lord such directions in the vedas are directly manifested from the breathing of the supreme personality of godhead it is said asya mahato bhtasya navasitam etad yad gvedo yajurveda smavedo tharv girasa the four vedasnamely the gveda yajurveda smaveda and atharvaveda are all emanations from the breathing of the great personality of godhead the lord being omnipotent can speak by breathing air as it is confirmed in the brahmasahit for the lord has the omnipotence to perform through each of his senses the actions of all other senses in other words the lord can speak through his breathing and he can impregnate by his eyes in fact it is said that he glanced over material nature and thus fathered all living entities after creating or impregnating the conditioned souls into the womb of material nature he gave his directions in the vedic wisdom as to how such conditioned souls can return home back to godhead we should always remember that the conditioned souls in material nature are all eager for material enjoyment but the vedic directions are so made that one can satisfy ones perverted desires then return to godhead having finished his socalled enjoyment it is a chance for the conditioned souls to attain liberation therefore the conditioned souls must try to follow the process of yaja by becoming ka conscious even those who cannot follow the vedic injunctions may adopt the principles of ka consciousness and that will take the place of performance of vedic yajas or karmas text 16 eva pravartita cakra nnuvartayatha ya aghyur indriyrmo mogha prtha sa jvati evamthus prescribed pravartitamestablished by the vedas cakram cycle nadoes not anuvartayatiadopt

does not follow this prescribed vedic system of sacrifice certainly leads a life of sin for a person delighting only in the senses lives in vain purport the mammonist philosophy of work very hard and enjoy sense gratification is condemned herein by the lord therefore for those who want to enjoy this material world the abovementioned cycle of performing yajas is absolutely necessary one who does not follow such regulations is living a very risky life being condemned more and more by natures law this human form of life is specifically meant for selfrealization in either of the three waysnamely karmayoga jnayoga or bhaktiyoga there is no necessity of rigidly following the performances of the prescribed yajas for the transcendentalists who are above vice and virtue but those who are engaged in sense gratification require purification by the abovementioned cycle of yaja performances there are different kinds of activities those who are not ka conscious are certainly engaged in sensory consciousness therefore they need to execute pious work the yaja system is planned in such a way that sensory conscious persons may satisfy their desires without becoming entangled in the reaction of sensegratificatory work the prosperity of the world depends not on our own efforts but on the background arrangement of the supreme lord directly carried out by the demigods therefore the yajas are directly aimed at the particular demigod mentioned in the vedas indirectly it is the practice of ka consciousness because when one masters the performance of yajas one is sure to become ka conscious but if by performing yajas one does not become ka conscious such principles are counted as only moral codes one should not therefore limit his progress only to the point of moral codes but should transcend them to attain ka consciousness text 17 yas tv tmaratir eva syd tmatpta ca mnava tmany eva ca santuas tasya krya na vidyate yaone who tubut tmaratitakes pleasure evacertainly syt remains

in ka consciousness no longer has any duty to perform due to his being ka conscious all impiety within is instantly cleansed an effect of many many thousands of yaja performances by such clearing of consciousness one becomes fully confident of his eternal position in relationship with the supreme his duty thus becomes selfilluminated by the grace of the lord and therefore he no longer has any obligations to the vedic injunctions such a ka conscious person is no longer interested in material activities and no longer takes pleasure in material arrangements like wine women and similar

the personality of godhead for the devotees and liberation for the impersonalist a person therefore acting for ka or in ka consciousness under proper guidance and without attachment to the result of the work is certainly making progress toward the supreme goal of life arjuna is told that he should fight in the battle of kuruketra for the interest of ka because ka wanted him to fight to be a good man or a nonviolent man is a personal attachment but to act on behalf of the supreme is to act without attachment for the result that is perfect action of the highest degree recommended by the supreme personality of godhead r ka vedic rituals like prescribed sacrifices are performed for purification of impious activities that were performed in the field of sense gratification but action in ka consciousness is transcendental to the reactions of good or evil work a ka conscious person has no attachment for the result but acts on behalf of ka alone he engages in all kinds of activities but is completely nonattached text 20 karmaaiva hi sasiddhim sthit janakdaya lokasagraham evpi sampayan kartum arhasi karmaby work evaeven hicertainly sasiddhimperfection sthitsituated janakadayakings like

selfrealized souls consequently they had no obligation to perform the prescribed duties in the vedas nonetheless they performed all prescribed activities just to set examples for the people in general janaka was the father of st and fatherinlaw of lord r rma being a great devotee of the lord he was transcendentally situated but because he was the king of mithila a subdivision of behar province in india he had to teach his subjects how to fight righteously in battle he and his subjects fought to teach people in general that violence is also necessary in a situation where good arguments fail before the battle of kuruketra every effort was made to avoid the war even by the supreme personality of godhead but the other party was determined to fight so for such a right cause there is a necessity for fighting although one who is situated in ka consciousness may not have any interest in the world he still works to teach the public how to live and how to act experienced persons in ka consciousness can act in such a way that others will follow and this is explained in the following verse text 21 yad yad carati rehas tat tad evetaro jana sa yat prama kurute lokas tad anuvartate

world pursues purport people in general always require a leader who can teach the public by practical behavior a leader cannot teach the public to stop smoking if he himself smokes lord caitanya said that a teacher should behave properly even before he begins teaching one who teaches in that way is called crya or the ideal teacher therefore a teacher must follow the principles of tra scripture to reach the common man the teacher cannot manufacture rules against the principles of revealed scriptures the revealed scriptures like manusahit and similar others are considered the standard books to be followed by human society thus the leaders teaching should be based on the principles of the standard rules as they are practiced by the great teachers the rmadbhgavatam also affirms that one should follow in the footsteps of great devotees and that is the way of progress on the path of spiritual realization the king or the executive head of a state the father and the school teacher are all considered to be natural leaders of the innocent people in general all such natural leaders have a great responsibility to their dependants therefore they must be conversant with standard books of moral and spiritual codes text 22 na me prthsti kartavya triu lokeu kicana nnavptam avptavya varta eva ca karmai nanone memine prthao son of pth astithere is kartavyam any prescribed duty triuin the

cbhyadhika ca dyate parsya aktir vividhaiva ryate svbhvik jnabalakriy ca the supreme lord is the controller of all other controllers and he is the greatest of all the diverse planetary leaders everyone is under his control all entities are delegated with particular power only by the supreme lord they are not supreme themselves he is also worshipable by all demigods and is the supreme director of all directors therefore he is transcendental to all kinds of material leaders and controllers and is worshipable by all there is no one greater than him and he is the supreme cause of all causes he does not possess bodily form like that of an ordinary living entity there is no difference between his body and his soul he is absolute all his senses are transcendental any one of his senses can perform the action of any other sense therefore no one is greater than him or equal to him his potencies are multifarious and thus his deeds are automatically performed as a natural sequence vetvatara upaniad 678 since everything is in full opulence in the personality of godhead and is existing in full truth there is no duty for the supreme personality of godhead to perform one who must receive the results of work has some designated duty but one who has nothing to achieve within the three planetary systems certainly has no duty and yet lord ka is engaged on the battlefield of kuruketra as the leader of the katriyas because the katriyas are dutybound to give protection to the distressed although he is above all the regulations of the revealed scriptures he does not do anything that violates the revealed scriptures text 23 yadi hy aha na varteya jtu karmay atandrita mama vartmnuvartante manuy prtha sarvaa yadiif hicertainly ahami nado not varteyamthus engage jtu

otherwise common men would follow in his footsteps because he is the greatest authority from the rmadbhgavatam it is understood that lord ka was performing all the religious duties at home and out of home as required of a householder text 24 utsdeyur ime lok na kury karma ced aham sakarasya ca kart sym upahanym im praj utsdeyuput into ruin imeall these lokworlds nado not kurymperform

disturbs the peace of the general society in order to check this social disturbance there are prescribed rules and regulations by which the population can automatically become peaceful and organized for spiritual progress in life when lord ka descends naturally he deals with such rules and regulations in order to maintain the prestige and necessity of such important performances the lord is the father of all living entities and if the living entities are misguided indirectly the responsibility goes to the lord therefore whenever there is general disregard of regulative principles the lord himself descends and corrects the society we should however note carefully that although we have to follow in the footsteps of the lord we still have to remember that we cannot imitate him following and imitating are not on the same level we cannot imitate the lord by lifting govardhana hill as the lord did in his childhood it is impossible for any human being we have to follow his instructions but we may not imitate him at any time the rmadbhgavatam affirms naitat samcarej jtu manaspi hy anvara vinayaty caran mauhyd yath rudro bdhija viam var vaca satya tathaivcarita kvacit te yat svavaco yukta buddhims tat samcaret one should simply follow the instructions of the lord and his empowered servants their instructions are all good for us and any intelligent person will perform them as instructed however one should guard against trying to imitate their actions one should not try to drink the ocean of poison in imitation of lord iva bhg 103330 we should always consider the position of the varas or those who can actually control the movements of the sun and moon as superior without such power one cannot imitate the varas who are superpowerful lord iva drank poison to the extent of swallowing an ocean but if any common man tries to drink even a fragment of such poison he will be killed there are many psuedodevotees of lord iva who want to indulge in smoking gj marijuana and similar intoxicating drugs forgetting that by so imitating the acts of lord iva they are calling death very near similarly there are some psuedodevotees of lord ka who prefer to imitate the lord in his rsall or dance of love forgetting their inability to lift govardhana hill it is best therefore that one not try to imitate the powerful but simply follow their instructions nor should one try to occupy their posts without qualification there are so many incarnations of god without the power of the supreme godhead text 25 sakt karmay avidvso yath kurvanti bhrata kuryd vidvs tathsakta cikrur

ultimate goal of life but because the conditioned souls do not know anything beyond sense gratification they study the vedas to that end through sense regulations however one is gradually elevated to ka consciousness therefore a realized soul in ka consciousness should not disturb others in their activities or understanding but he should act by showing how the results of all work can be dedicated to the service of ka the learned ka conscious person may act in such a way that the ignorant person working for sense gratification may learn how to act and how to behave although the ignorant man is not to be disturbed in his activities still a slightly developed ka conscious person may directly be engaged in the service of the lord without waiting for other vedic formulas for this fortunate man there is no need to follow the vedic rituals because in direct ka consciousness one can have all the results simply by following the prescribed duties of a particular person text 27 prakte kriyamni

actuality carried out by nature purport two persons one in ka consciousness and the other in material consciousness working on the same level may appear to be working on the same platform but there is a wide gulf of difference in their respective positions the person in material consciousness is convinced by false ego that he is the doer of everything he does not know that the mechanism of the body is produced by material nature which works under the supervision of the supreme lord the materialistic person has no knowledge that ultimately he is under the control of ka the person in false ego takes all credit for doing everything independently and that is the symptom of his nescience he does not know that this gross and subtle body is the creation of material nature under the order of the supreme personality of godhead and as such his bodily and mental activities should be engaged in the service of ka in ka consciousness the ignorant man forgets that the supreme personality of godhead is known as hkea or the master of the senses of the material body for due to his long misuse of the senses in sense gratification he is factually bewildered by the false ego which makes him forget his eternal relationship with ka text 28 tattvavit tu mahbho guakarmavibhgayo gu gueu vartanta iti matv na sajjate tattvavitthe knower of the absolute truth tubut mahbhoo mightyarmed one guakarmaworks

absolute truth is convinced of his awkward position in material association he knows that he is part and parcel of the supreme personality of godhead ka and that his position should not be in the material creation he knows his real identity as part and parcel of the supreme who is eternal bliss and knowledge and he realizes that somehow or other he is entrapped in the material conception of life in his pure state of existence he is meant to dovetail his activities in devotional service to the supreme personality of godhead ka he therefore engages himself in the activities of ka consciousness and becomes naturally unattached to the activities of the material senses which are all circumstantial and temporary he knows that his material condition of life is under the supreme control of the lord consequently he is not disturbed by all kinds of material reactions which he considers to be the mercy of the lord according to rmadbhgavatam one who knows the absolute truth in three different featuresnamely brahman paramtm and the supreme personality of godheadis called tattvavit for he knows also his own factual position in relationship with the supreme text 29 prakter

bewildered by the modes of material nature the ignorant fully engage themselves in material activities and become attached but the wise should not unsettle them although these duties are inferior due to the performers lack of knowledge purport persons who are unknowledgeable falsely identify with gross material consciousness and are full of material designations this body is a gift of the material nature and one who is too much attached to the bodily consciousness is called mandn or a lazy person without understanding of spirit soul ignorant men think of the body as the self bodily connections with others are accepted as kinsmanship the land in which the body is obtained is the object of worship and the formalities of religious rituals are considered ends in themselves social work nationalism and altruism are some of the activities for such materially designated persons under the spell of such designations they are always busy in the material field for them spiritual realization is a myth and so they are not interested such bewildered persons may even be engaged in such primary moral principles of life as nonviolence and similar materially benevolent work those who are however enlightened in spiritual life should not try to agitate such materially engrossed persons better to prosecute ones own spiritual activities silently men who are ignorant cannot appreciate activities in ka consciousness and therefore lord ka advises us not to disturb them and simply waste valuable time but the devotees of the lord are more kind than the lord because they understand the purpose of the lord consequently they undertake all kinds of risks even to the point of approaching ignorant men to try to engage them in the acts of ka consciousness which are absolutely necessary for the human being text 30 mayi sarvi karmi sannyasydhytmacetas nirr nirmamo bhtv yudhyasva vigatajvara mayiunto me sarviall sorts of karmiactivities sannyasya giving up

therefore o arjuna surrendering all your works unto me with mind intent on me and without desire for gain and free from egoism and lethargy fight purport this verse clearly indicates the purpose of the bhagavadgt the lord instructs that one has to become fully ka conscious to discharge duties as if in military discipline such an injunction may make things a little difficult nevertheless duties must be carried out with dependence on ka because that is the constitutional position of the living entity the living entity cannot be happy independant of the cooperation of the supreme lord because the eternal constitutional position of the living entity is to become subordinate to the desires of the lord arjuna was therefore ordered by r ka to fight as if the lord were his military commander one has to sacrifice everything for the good will of the supreme lord and at the same time discharge prescribed duties without claiming proprietorship arjuna did not have to consider the order of the lord he had only to execute his order the supreme lord is the soul of all souls therefore one who depends solely and wholly on the supreme soul without personal consideration or in other words one who is fully ka conscious is called adhytma cetas nir means that one has to act on the order of the master nor should one ever expect fruitive results the cashier may count millions of dollars for his employer but he does not claim a cent for himself similarly one has to realize that nothing in the world belongs to any individual person but that everything belongs to the supreme lord that is the real purport of mayi or unto me and when one acts in such ka consciousness certainly he does not claim proprietorship over anything this consciousness is called nirmama or nothing is mine and if there is any reluctance to execute such a stern order which is without consideration of socalled kinsmen in the bodily relationship that reluctance should be thrown off in this way one may become vigatajvara or without feverish mentality or lethargy everyone according to his quality and position has a particular type of work to discharge and all such duties may be discharged in ka consciousness as described above that will lead one to the path of liberation text 31 ye me matam ida nityam anutihanti mnav raddhvanto nasyanto mucyante te pi karmabhi yethose memy mataminjunctions

purport the injunction of the supreme personality of godhead ka is the essence of all vedic wisdom and therefore is eternally true without exception as the vedas are eternal so this truth of ka consciousness is also eternal one should have firm faith in this injunction without envying the lord there are many philosophers who write comments on the bhagavad gt but have no faith in ka they will never be liberated from the bondage of fruitive action but an ordinary man with firm faith in the eternal injunctions of the lord even though unable to execute such orders becomes liberated from the bondage of the law of karma in the beginning of ka consciousness one may not fully discharge the injunctions of the lord but because one is not resentful of this principle and works sincerely without consideration of defeat and hopelessness he will surely be promoted to the stage of pure ka consciousness text 32 ye tv etad abhyasyanto nnutihanti me matam sarvajnavimhs tn viddhi nan acetasa yethose

ignorance and bondage purport the flaw of not being ka conscious is clearly stated herein as there is punishment for disobedience to the order of the supreme executive head so there is certainly punishment for the disobedience of the order of the supreme personality of godhead a disobedient person however great he may be is ignorant of his own self of the supreme brahman and paramtm and the personality of godhead due to a vacant heart therefore there is no hope of perfection of life for him text 33 sada ceate svasy prakter jnavn api prakti ynti bhtni nigrahah ki kariyati sadamaccordingly

knowledge acts according to his own nature for everyone follows his nature what can repression accomplish purport unless one is situated on the transcendental platform of ka consciousness he cannot get free from the influence of the modes of material nature as it is confirmed by the lord in the seventh chapter 714 therefore even for the most highly educated person on the mundane plane it is impossible to get out of the entanglement of my simply by theoretical knowledge or by separating the soul from the body there are many socalled spiritualists who outwardly pose to be advanced in the science but inwardly or privately are completely under the particular modes of nature which they are unable to surpass academically one may be very learned but because of his long association with material nature he is in bondage ka consciousness helps one to get out of the material entanglement even though one may be engaged in his prescribed duties therefore without being fully in ka consciousness no one should suddenly give up his prescribed duties and become a socalled yog or transcendentalist artificially it is better to be situated in ones position and to try to attain ka consciousness under superior training thus one may be freed from the clutches of my text 34 indriyasyendriyasyrthe rgadveau vyavasthitau tayor na vaam gacchet tau hy asya paripanthinau indriyasyaof

asyahis paripanthinau stumbling blocks translation attraction and repulsion for sense objects are felt by embodied beings but one should not fall under the control of senses and sense objects because they are stumbling blocks on the path of selfrealization purport those who are in ka consciousness are naturally reluctant to engage in material sense gratifications but those who are not in such consciousness should follow the rules and regulations of the revealed scriptures unrestricted sense enjoyment is the cause of material encagement but one who follows the rules and regulations of the revealed scriptures does not become entangled by the sense objects for example sex enjoyment is a necessity for the conditioned soul and sex enjoyment is allowed under the license of marriage ties for example according to scriptural injunctions one is forbidden to engage in sex relationships with any women other than ones wife all other women are to be considered as ones mother but in spite of such injunctions a man is still inclined to have sex relationships with other women these propensities are to be curbed otherwise they will be stumbling blocks on the path of selfrealization as long as the material body is there the necessities of the material body are allowed but under rules and regulations and yet we should not rely upon the control of such allowances one has to follow those rules and regulations unattached to them because practice of sense gratifications under regulations may also lead one to go astrayas much as there is always the chance of an accident even on the royal roads although they may be very carefully maintained no one can guarantee that there will be no danger even on the safest road the sense enjoyment spirit has been current a very long long time owing to material association therefore in spite of regulated sense enjoyment there is every chance of falling down therefore any attachment for regulated sense enjoyment must also be avoided by all means but action in the loving service of ka detaches one from all kinds of sensory activities therefore no one should try to be detached from ka consciousness at any stage of life the whole purpose of detachment from all kinds of sense attachment is ultimately to become situated on the platform of ka consciousness text 35 reyn svadharmo vigua paradharmt svanuhitt svadharme nidhana reya paradharmo

destruction reyabetter paradharmaduties prescribed for others bhayavahadangerous translation it is far better to discharge ones prescribed duties even though they may be faulty than anothers duties destruction in the course of performing ones own duty is better than engaging in anothers duties for to follow anothers path is dangerous purport one should therefore discharge his prescribed duties in full ka consciousness rather than those prescribed for others prescribed duties complement ones psychophysical condition under the spell of the modes of material nature spiritual duties are as ordered by the spiritual master for the transcendental service of ka but both materially or spiritually one should stick to his prescribed duties even up to death rather than imitate anothers prescribed duties duties on the spiritual platform and duties on the material platform may be different but the principle of following the authorized direction is always good for the performer when one is under the spell of the modes of material nature one should follow the prescribed rules for particular situations and should not imitate others for example a brhmaa who is in the mode of goodness is nonviolent whereas a katriya who is in the mode of passion is allowed to be violent as such for a katriya it is better to be vanquished following the rules of violence than to imitate a brhmaa who follows the principles of nonviolence everyone has to cleanse his heart by a gradual process not abruptly however when one transcends the modes of material nature and is fully situated in ka consciousness he can perform anything and everything under the direction of the bona fide spiritual master in that complete stage of ka consciousness the katriya may act as a brhmaa or a brhmaa may act as a katriya in the transcendental stage the distinctions of the material world do not apply for example vivmitra was originally a katriya but later on he acted as a brhmaa whereas paraurma was a brhmaa but later on he acted as a katriya being transcendentally situated they could do so but as long as one is on the material platform he must perform his duties according to the modes of material nature at the same time he must have a full sense of ka consciousness text 36 arjuna uvca atha kena prayukto ya ppa carati prua anicchann api vreya bald iva niyojita arjuna uvcaarjuna said

said o descendant of vi by what is one impelled to sinful acts even unwillingly as if engaged by force purport a living entity as part and parcel of the supreme is originally spiritual pure and free from all material contaminations therefore by nature he is not subjected to the sins of the material world but when he is in contact with the material nature he acts in many sinful ways without hesitation and sometimes even against his will as such arjunas question to ka is very sanguine as to the perverted nature of the living entities although the living entity sometimes does not want to act in sin he is still forced to act sinful actions are not however impelled by the supersoul within but are due to another cause as the lord explains in the next verse text 37 rbhagavn uvca kma ea

the material modes of passion and later transformed into wrath and which is the alldevouring sinful enemy of this world purport when a living entity comes in contact with the material creation his eternal love for ka is transformed into lust in association with the mode of passion or in other words the sense of love of god becomes transformed into lust as milk in contact with sour tamarind is transformed into yogurt then again when lust is unsatisfied it turns into wrath wrath is transformed into illusion and illusion continues the material existence therefore lust is the greatest enemy of the living entity and it is lust only which induces the pure living entity to remain entangled in the material world wrath is the manifestation of the mode of ignorance these modes exhibit themselves as wrath and other corollaries if therefore the modes of passion instead of being degraded into the modes of ignorance are elevated to the modes of goodness by the prescribed method of iiving and acting then one can be saved from the degradation of wrath by spiritual attachment the supreme personality of godhead expanded himself into many for his everincreasing spiritual bliss and the living entities are parts and parcels of this spiritual bliss they also have partial independence but by misuse of their independence when the service attitude is transformed into the propensity for sense enjoyment they come under the sway of lust this material creation is created by the lord to give a facility to the conditioned souls to fulfill these lustful propensities and when they are completely baffled by prolonged lustful activities the living entities begin to inquire about their real position this inquiry is the beginning of the vedntastras wherein it is said athto brahmajijs one should inquire into the supreme and the supreme is defined in rmadbhgavatam as janmdyasya yato nvayd itarata ca or the origin of everything is the supreme brahman therefore the origin of lust is also in the supreme if therefore lust is transformed into love for the supreme or transformed into ka consciousnessor in other words desiring everything for kathen bothlust and wrath can be spiritualized hanumn the great servitor of lord rama engaged his wrath upon his enemies for the satisfaction of the lord therefore lust and wrath when they are employed in ka consciousness become our friends instead of our enemies text 38 dhmenvriyate vahnir yathdaro malena ca yatholbenvto garbhas tath tenedam vtam dhmenaby smoke vriyatecovered vahnifire yathjust as daramirror malenaby dust caalso yathjust as ulbenaby the womb vtais covered garbhaembryo tathso tenaby that lust idamthis vtamis covered translation as fire is covered by smoke as a mirror is covered by dust or as the embryo is covered by the womb similarly the living entity is covered by different degrees of this lust purport there are three degrees of covering of the living entity by which his pure consciousness is obscured this covering is but lust under different manifestations like smoke in the fire dust on the mirror and the womb about the embryo when lust is compared to smoke it is understood that the fire of the living spark can be a little perceived in other words when the living entity exhibits his ka consciousness slightly he may be likened to the fire covered by smoke although fire is necessary where there is smoke there is no overt manifestation of fire in the early stage this stage is like the beginning of ka consciousness the dust on the mirror refers to a cleansing process of the mirror of the mind by so many spiritual methods the best process is to chant the holy names of the lord the embryo covered by the womb is an analogy illustrating a helpless position for the child in the womb is so helpless that he cannot even move this stage of living condition can be compared to that of the trees the trees are also living entities but they have been put in such a condition of life by such a great exhibition of lust that they are almost void of all consciousness the covered mirror is compared to the birds and beasts and the smoke covered fire is compared to the human being in the form of a human being the living entity may revive a little ka consciousness and if he makes further development the fire of spiritual life can be kindled in the human form of life by careful handling of the smoke in the fire the fire can be made to blaze therefore the human form of life is a chance for the living entity to escape the entanglement of material existence in the human form of life one can conquer the enemy lust by cultivation of ka consciousness under able guidance text 39 vta jnam etena jnino nityavairi kmarpea kaunteya duprenalena ca vtamcovered jnampure consciousness etenaby this jnina of the knower nityavairieternal enemy kmarpeain the form of lust kaunteyao son of kunt dupreanever to be satisfied analena by the fire caalso translation thus a mans pure consciousness is covered by his eternal enemy in the form of lust which is never satisfied and which burns like fire purport it is said in the manusmti that lust cannot be satisfied by any amount of sense enjoyment just as fire is never extinguished by a constant supply of fuel in the material world the center of all activities is sex and thus this material world is called maithuyagra or the shackles of sex life in the ordinary prison house criminals are kept within bars similarly the criminals who are disobedient to the laws of the lord are shackled by sex life advancement of material civilization on the basis of sense gratification means increasing the duration of the material existence of a living entity therefore this lust is the symbol of ignorance by which the living entity is kept within the material world while one enjoys sense gratification it may be that there is some feeling of happiness but actually that socalled feeling of happiness is the ultimate enemy of the sense enjoyer text 40 indriyi mano

vimohayatibewilders eaof this jnamknowledge vtya covering dehinamthe embodied translation the senses the mind and the intelligence are the sitting places of this lust which veils the real knowledge of the living entity and bewilders him purport the enemy has captured different strategic positions in the body of the conditioned soul and therefore lord ka is giving hints of those places so that one who wants to conquer the enemy may know where he can be found mind is the center of all the activities of the senses and thus the mind is the reservoir of all ideas of sense gratification and as a result the mind and the senses become the repositories of lust next the intelligence department becomes the capital of such lustful propensities intelligence is the immediate nextdoor neighbor of the spirit soul lusty intelligence influences the spirit soul to acquire the false ego and identify itself with matter and thus with the mind and senses the spirit soul becomes addicted to enjoying the material senses and mistakes this as true happiness this false identification of the spirit soul is very nicely explained in the rmadbhgavatam yasytmabuddhi kupe tridhtuke svadh kalatrdiu bhauma idyadh yattrthabuddhi salite na karhicij janev abhijeu sa eva gokhara a human being who identifies this body made of three elements with his self who considers the byproducts of the body to be his kinsmen who considers the land of birth as worshipable and who goes to the place of pilgrimage simply to take a bath rather than meet men of transcendental knowledge there is to be considered as an ass or a cow text 41 tasmt tvam indriyy dau niyamya bharatarabha ppmna prajahi hy ena jnavijnananam tasmttherefore tvamyou indriyisenses dauin the beginning niyamyaby regulating bharatarabhao chief

best of the bhratas in the very beginning curb this great symbol of sin lust by regulating the senses and slay this destroyer of knowledge and selfrealization purport the lord advised arjuna to regulate the senses from the very beginning so that he could curb the greatest sinful enemy lust which destroys the urge for selfrealization and specifically knowledge of the self jnam refers to knowledge of self as distinguished from nonself or in other words knowledge that the spirit soul is not the body vijnam refers to specific knowledge of the spirit soul and knowledge of ones constitutional position and his relationship to the supreme soul it is explained thus in the rmadbhgavatam jna paramaguhya me yadvijna samanvitam sarahasya tadaga ca ghna gadita may the knowledge of the self and the supreme self is very confidential and mysterious being veiled by my but such knowledge and specific realization can be understood if it is explained by the lord himself bhagavadgt gives us that knowledge specifically knowledge of the self the living entities are parts and parcels of the lord and therefore they are simply meant to serve the lord this consciousness is called ka consciousness so from the very beginning of life one has to learn this ka consciousness and thereby one may become fully ka conscious and act accordingly lust is only the perverted reflection of the love of god which is natural for every living entity but if one is educated in ka consciousness from the very beginning that natural love of god cannot deteriorate into lust when love of god deteriorates into lust it is very difficult to return to the normal condition nonetheless ka consciousness is so powerful that even a late beginner can become a lover of god by following the regulative principles of devotional service so from any stage of life or from the time of understanding its urgency one can begin regulating the senses in ka consciousness devotional service of the lord and turn the lust into love of godheadthe highest perfectional stage of human life text 42 indriyi pary hur indriyebhya para mana manasas tu par buddhir yo buddhe paratas tu sa indriysenses

paratasuperior tubut sahe translation the working senses are superior to dull matter mind is higher than the senses intelligence is still higher than the mind and he the soul is even higher than the intelligence purport the senses are different outlets for the activities of lust lust is reserved within the body but it is given vent through the senses therefore the senses are superior to the body as a whole these outlets are not in use when there is superior consciousness or ka consciousness in ka consciousness the soul makes direct connection with the supreme personality of godhead therefore the bodily functions as described here ultimately end in the supreme soul bodily action means the functions of the senses and stopping the senses means stopping all bodily actions but since the mind is active then even though the body may be silent and at rest the mind will actas it does during dreaming but above the mind there is the determination of the intelligence and above the intelligence is the soul proper if therefore the soul is directly engaged with the supreme naturally all other subordinates namely the intelligence mind and the senses will be automatically engaged in the kaha upaniad there is a passage in which it is said that the objects of sense gratification are superior to the senses and mind is superior to the sense objects if therefore the mind is directly engaged in the service of the lord constantly then there is no chance of the senses becoming engaged in other ways this mental attitude has already been explained if the mind is engaged in the transcendental service of the lord there is no chance of its being engaged in the lower propensities in the kaha upaniad the soul has been described as mahn the great therefore the soul is above allnamely the sense objects the senses the mind and the intelligence therefore directly understanding the constitutional position of the soul is the solution of the whole problem with intelligence one has to seek out the constitutional position of the soul and then engage the mind always in ka consciousness that solves the whole problem a neophyte spiritualist is generally advised to keep aloof from the objects of senses one has to strengthen the mind by use of intelligence if by intelligence one engages ones mind in ka consciousness by complete surrender unto the supreme personality of godhead then automatically the mind becomes stronger and even though the senses are very strong like serpents they will be no more effective than serpents with broken fangs but even though the soul is the master of intelligence and mind and the senses also still unless it is strengthened by association with ka in ka consciousness there is every chance of falling down due to the agitated mind text 43 eva

control the lower self by the higher self and thus by spiritual strengthconquer this insatiable enemy known as lust purport this third chapter of the bhagavadgt is conclusively directive to ka consciousness by knowing oneself as the eternal servitor of the supreme personality of godhead without considering impersonal voidness as the ultimate end in the material existence of life one is certainly influenced by propensities for lust and desire for dominating the resources of material nature desire for overlording and sense gratification are the greatest enemies of the conditioned soul but by the strength of ka consciousness one can control the material senses the mind and the intelligence one may not give up work and prescribed duties all of a sudden but by gradually developing ka consciousness one can be situated in a transcendental position without being influenced by the material senses and the mindby steady intelligence directed toward ones pure identity this is the sum total of this chapter in the immature stage of material existence philosophical speculations and artificial attempts to control the senses by the socalled practice of yogic postures can never help a man toward spiritual life he must be trained in ka consciousness by higher intelligence thus end the bhaktivedanta purports to the third chapter of the rmadbhagavadgt in the matter of karmayoga or the discharge of ones prescribed duty in ka consciousness chapter four transcendental knowledge text 1 r bhagavn uvca ima vivasvate yoga proktavn aham avyayam vivasvn manave prha manur ikvkave bravt r

traced from a remote time when it was delivered to the royal order the kings of all planets this science is especially meant for the protection of the inhabitants and therefore the royal order should understand it in order to be able to rule the citizens and protect them from the material bondage to lust human life is meant for cultivation of spiritual knowledge in eternal relationship with the supreme personality of godhead and the executive heads of all states and all planets are obliged to impart this lesson to the citizens by education culture and devotion in other words the executive heads of all states are intended to spread the science of ka consciousness so that the people may take advantage of this great science and pursue a successful path utilizing the opportunity of the human form of life in this millennium the sungod is known as vivasvn the king of the sun which is the origin of all planets within the solar system in the brahmasahit it is stated yaccakur ea savit

sun is the king of the planets and the sungod at present of the name vivasvn rules the sun planet which is controlling all other planets by supplying heat and light he is rotating under the order of ka and lord ka originally made vivasvn his first disciple to understand the science of bhagavadgt the gt is not therefore a speculative treatise for the insignificant mundane scholar but is a standard book of knowledge coming down from time immemorial in the mahbhrata ntiparva 3485152 we can trace out the history of the gt as follows tretyugdau ca tato vivasvn manave dadau manu ca lokabhtyartha sutyekvkave dadau ikvku ca kathito vypya lokn avasthit in the beginning of the tretyuga millennium this science of the relationship with the supreme was delivered by vivasvn to manu manu being the father of mankind gave it to his son mahrja ikvku the king of this earth planet and forefather of the raghu dynasty in which lord rmacandra appeared therefore bhagavadgt existed in the human society from the time of mahrja ikvku at the present moment we have just passed through five thousand years of the kaliyuga which lasts 432000 years before this there was dvparayuga 800000 years and before that there was tretyuga 1200000 years thus some 2005000 years ago manu spoke the bhagavadgt to his disciple and son mahrja lkvku the king of this planet earth the age of the current manu is calculated to last some 305300000 years of which 120400000 have passed accepting that before the birth of manu the gt was spoken by the lord to his disciple the sungod vivasvn a rough estimate is that the gt was spoken at least 120400000 years ago and in human society it has been extant for two million years it was respoken by the lord again to arjuna about five thousand years ago that is the rough estimate of the history of the gta according to the gt itself and according to the version of the speaker lord r ka it was spoken to the sungod vivasvn because he is also a katriya and is the father of all katriyas who are descendants of the sungod or the sryavaa katriyas because bhagavadgt is as good as the vedas being spoken by the supreme personality of godhead this knowledge is apaurueya superhuman since the vedic instructions are accepted as they are without human interpretation the gt must therefore be accepted without mundane interpretation the mundane wranglers may speculate on the gt in their own ways but that is not bhagavadgt as it is therefore bhagavad gt has to be accepted as it is from the disciplic succession and it is described herein that the lord spoke to the sungod the sungod spoke to his son manu and manu spoke to his son ikvku text 2 eva paramparprptam ima rjarayo vidu sa kleneha mahat yogo naa parantapa evamthus parampardisciplic succession prptamreceived imam

time the succession was broken and therefore the science as it is appears to be lost purport it is clearly stated that the gt was especially meant for the saintly kings because they were to execute its purpose in ruling over the citizens certainly bhagavadgt was never meant for the demonic persons who would dissipate its value for no ones benefit and would devise all types of interpretations according to personal whims as soon as the original purpose was scattered by the motives of the unscrupulous commentators there arose the need to reestablish the disciplic succession five thousand years ago it was detected by the lord himself that the disciplic succession was broken and therefore he declared that the purpose of the gt appeared to be lost in the same way at the present moment also there are so many editions of the gt especially in english but almost all of them are not according to authorized disciplic succession there are innumerable interpretations rendered by different mundane scholars but almost all of them do not accept the supreme personality of godhead ka although they make a good business on the words of r ka this spirit is demonic because demons do not believe in god but simply enjoy the property of the supreme since there is a great need of an edition of the gt in english as it is received by the parampar disciplic succession system an attempt is made herewith to fulfill this great want bhagavadgtaccepted as it isis a great boon to humanity but if it is accepted as a treatise of philosophical speculations it is simply a waste of time text 3 sa evya

is today told by me to you because you are my devotee as well as my friend therefore you can understand the transcendental mystery of this science purport there are two classes of men namely the devotee and the demon the lord selected arjuna as the recipient of this great science owing to his becoming the devotee of the lord but for the demon it is not possible to understand this great mysterious science there are a number of editions of this great book of knowledge and some of them have commentaries by the devotees and some of them have commentaries by the demons commentation by the devotees is real whereas that of the demons is useless arjuna accepts r ka as the supreme personality of godhead and any commentary on the gt following in the footsteps of arjuna is real devotional service to the cause of this great science the demonic however concoct something about ka and mislead the public and general readers from the path of kas instructions one should try to follow the disciplic succession from arjuna and thus be benefitted text 4 arjuna uvca apara bhavato janma para janma vivasvata katham etad vijny tvam dau proktavn iti arjuna uvcaarjuna said aparamjunior bhavatayour janma birth paramsuperior janmabirth vivasvataof the sungod katham how etatthis vijnymshall i understand tvamyou dauin the beginning proktavninstructed itithus translation arjuna said the sungod vivasvn is senior by birth to you how am i to understand that in the beginning you instructed this science to him purport arjuna is an accepted devotee of the lord so how could he not believe kas words the fact is that arjuna is not inquiring for himself but for those who do not believe in the supreme personality of godhead or for the demons who do not like the idea that ka should be accepted as the supreme personality of godhead for them only arjuna inquires on this point as if he were himself not aware of the personality of godhead or ka as it will be evident from the tenth chapter arjuna knew perfectly well that ka is the supreme personality of godhead the fountainhead of everything and the last word in transcendence of course ka also appeared as the son of devak on this earth how ka remained the same supreme personality of godhead the eternal original person is very difficult for an ordinary man to understand therefore to clarify this point arjuna put this question before ka so that he himself could speak authoritatively that ka is the supreme authority is accepted by the whole world not only at present but from time immemorial and the demons alone reject him anyway since ka is the authority accepted by all arjuna put this question before him in order that ka would describe himself without being depicted by the demons who always try to distort him in a way understandable to the demons and their followers it is necessary that everyone for his own interest know the science of ka therefore when ka himself speaks about himself it is auspicious for all the worlds to the demons such explanations by ka himself may appear to be strange because the demons always study ka from their own standpoint but those who are devotees heartily welcome the statements of ka when they are spoken by ka himself the devotees will always worship such authoritative statements of ka because they are always eager to know more and more about him the atheists who consider ka an ordinary man may in this way come to know that ka is superhuman that he is saccidnandavigrahathe eternal form of bliss and knowledge that he is transcendental and that he is above the domination of the modes of material nature and above the influence of time and space a devotee of kas like arjuna is undoubtedly above any misunderstanding of the transcendental position of ka arjunas putting this question before the lord is simply an attempt by the devotee to defy the atheistic attitude of persons who consider ka to be an ordinary human being subject to the modes of material nature text 5 r bhagavn uvca bahni me vyattni janmni tava crjuna tny aha veda sarvi na tva vettha parantapa r bhagavn uvcathe personality of godhead said bahnimany meof mine vyattnihave passed

there advaitam acyutam andim anantarpam dya purapurua navayauvana ca vedeu durllabham adurllabham tmabhaktau govindam dipurua tam aha bhajmi bs 533 i worship the supreme personality of godhead govinda ka who is the original personabsolute infallible without beginning although expanded into unlimited forms still the same original the oldest and the person always appearing as a fresh youth such eternal blissful allknowing forms of the lord are usually understood by the best vedic scholars but they are always manifest to pure unalloyed devotees it is also stated in brahmasahit rmdi mrttiu kalniyamena tihan nnvatram akarod bhuvaneu kintu ka svaya samabhavat parama pumn yo govindam dipurua tam aha bhajmi bs 539 i worship the supreme personality of godhead govinda ka who is always situated in various incarnations such as rma nsiha and many subincarnations as well but who is the original personality of godhead known as ka and who incarnates personally also in the vedas also it is said that the lord although one without a second nevertheless manifests himself in innumerable forms he is like the vaidurya stone which changes color yet still remains one all those multiforms are understood by the pure unalloyed devotees but not by a simple study of the vedas vedeu durllabham adurllabham tmabhaktau devotees like arjuna are constant companions of the lord and whenever the lord incarnates the associate devotees also incarnate in order to serve the lord in different capacities arjuna is one of these devotees and in this verse it is understood that some millions of years ago when lord ka spoke the bhagavadgt to the sungod vivasvn arjuna in a different capacity was also present but the difference between the lord and arjuna is that the lord remembered the incidence whereas arjuna could not remember that is the difference between the part and parcel living entity and the supreme lord although arjuna is addressed herein as the mighty hero who could subdue the enemies he is unable to recall what had happened in his various past births therefore a living entity however great he may be in the material estimation can never equal the supreme lord anyone who is a constant companion of the lord is certainly a liberated person but he cannot be equal to the lord the lord is described in the brahma sahit as infallible acyuta which means that he never forgets himself even though he is in material contact therefore the lord and the living entity can never be equal in all respects even if the living entity is as liberated as arjuna although arjuna is a devotee of the lord he sometimes forgets the nature of the lord but by the divine grace a devotee can at once understand the infallible condition of the lord whereas a nondevotee or a demon cannot understand this transcendental nature consequently these descriptions in the gt cannot be understood by demonic brains ka remembered acts which were performed by him millions of years before but arjuna could not despite the fact that both ka and arjuna are eternal in nature we may also note herein that a living entity forgets everything due to his change of body but the lord remembers because he does not change his saccidnanda body he is advaita which means there is no distinction between his body and himself everything in relation to him is spiritwhereas the conditioned soul is different from his material body and because the lords body and self are identical his position is always different from the ordinary living entity even when he descends to the material platform the demons cannot adjust themselves to this transcendental nature of the lord as the lord explains in the following verse text 6 ajo pi sann avyaytm bhtnm varo pi san prakti svm adhihya sambhavmy tmamyay ajaunborn apialthough sanbeing so avyayawithout deterioration tmbody bhtnmall those who are born varathe supreme lord apialthough sanbeing so praktimtranscendental form svm of myself adhihyabeing so situated sambhavmii do incarnate tmamyayby my internal energy translation although i am unborn and my transcendental body never deteriorates and although i am the lord of all sentient beings i still appear in every millennium in my original transcendental form purport the lord has spoken about the peculiarity of his birth although he may appear like an ordinary person he remembers everything of his many many past births whereas a common man cannot remember what he has done even a few hours before if someone is asked what he did exactly at the same time one day earlier it would be very difficult for a common man to answer immediately he would surely have to dredge his memory to recall what he was doing exactly at the same time one day before and yet men often dare claim to be god or ka one should not be misled by such meaningless claims then again the lord explains his prakti or his form prakti means nature as well as svarpa or ones own form the lord says that he appears in his own body he does not change his body as the common living entity changes from one body to another the conditioned soul may have one kind of body in the present birth but he has a different body in the next birth in the material world the living entity has no fixed body but transmigrates from one body to another the lord however does not do so whenever he appears he does so in the same original body by his internal potency in other words ka appears in this material world in his original eternal form with two hands holding a flute he appears exactly in his eternal body uncontaminated by this material world although he appears in the same transcendental body and is lord of the universe it still appears that he takes his birth like an ordinary living entity despite the fact lord ka grows from childhood to boyhood and from boyhood to youth astonishingly enough he never ages beyond youth at the time of the battle of kuruketra he had many grandchildren at home or in other words he had sufficiently aged by material calculations still he looked just like a young man twenty or twentyfive years old we never see a picture of ka in old age because he never grows old like us although he is the oldest person in the whole creationpast present and future neither his body nor his intelligence ever deteriorates or changes therefore it is clear that in spite of his being in the material world he is the same unborn eternal form of bliss and knowledge changeless in his transcendental body and intelligence factually his appearance and disappearance are like the suns rising moving before us and then disappearing from our eyesight when the sun is out of sight we think that the sun is set and when the sun is before our eyes we think that the sun is on the horizon actually the sun is always in its fixed position but owing to our defective insufficient senses we calculate the appearance and disappearance of the sun in the sky and because his appearance and disappearance are completely different from that of any ordinary common living entity it is evident that he is eternal blissful knowledge by his internal potencyand he is never contaminated by material nature the vedas also confirm that the supreme personality of godhead is unborn yet he still appears to take his birth in multi manifestations the vedic supplementary literatures also confirm that even though the lord appears to be taking his birth he is still without change of body in the bhgavatam he appears before his mother as nryaa with four hands and the decorations of the six kinds of full opulences his appearance in his original eternal form is his causeless mercy according to the vivakoa dictionary the lord is conscious of all of his previous appearances and disappearances but a common living entity forgets everything about his past body as soon as he gets another body he is the lord of all living entities because he performs wonderful and superhuman activities while he is on this earth therefore the lord is always the same absolute truth and is without differentiation between his form and self or between his quality and body a question may now be raised as to why the lord appears and disappears in this world this is explained in the next verse text 7 yad yad hi dharmasya glnir bhavati bhrata abhyutthnam adharmasya tadtmna sjmy aham yadwhenever yadwherever hicertainly dharmasyaof religion glnidiscrepancies bhavatimanifested becomes bhratao descendant of bharata abhyutthnampredominance adharmasyaof irreligion tadat that time tmnamself sjmimanifest ahami translation whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice o descendant of bharata and a predominant rise of irreligionat that time i descend myself purport the word sjmi is significant herein sjmi cannot be used in the sense of creation because according to the previous verse there is no creation of the lords form or body since all of the forms are eternally existent therefore sjmi means that the lord manifests himself as he is although the lord appears on schedule namely at the end of dvparayuga of the twentyeighth millennium of the eighth manu in one day of brahm still he has no obligation to adhere to such rules and regulations because he is completely free to act in many ways at his will he therefore appears by his own will whenever there is a predominance of irreligiosity and a disappearance of true religion principles of religion are laid down in the vedas and any discrepancy in the matter of properly executing the rules of the vedas makes one irreligious in the bhgavatam it is stated that such principles are the laws of the lord only the lord can manufacture a system of religion the vedas are also accepted as originally spoken by the lord himself to brahm from within his heart therefore the principles of dharma or religion are the direct orders of the supreme personality of godhead dharma tu sktbhagavatpratam these principles are clearly indicated throughout the bhagavadgt the purpose of the vedas is to establish such principles under the order of the supreme lord and the lord directly orders at the end of the gt that the highest principle of religion is to surrender unto him only and nothing more the vedic principles push one towards complete surrender unto him and whenever such principles are disturbed by the demonic the lord appears from the bhgavatam we understand that lord buddha is the incarnation of ka who appeared when materialism was rampant and materialists were using the pretext of the authority of the vedas although there are certain restrictive rules and regulations regarding animal sacrifice for particular purposes in the vedas people of demonic tendency still took to animal sacrifice without reference to the vedic principles lord buddha appeared to stop this nonsense and to establish the vedic principles of nonviolence therefore each and every avatra or incarnation of the lord has a particular mission and they are all described in the revealed scriptures no one should be accepted as an avatra unless he is referred to by scriptures it is not a fact that the lord appears only on indian soil he can advent himself anywhere and everywhere and whenever he desires to appear in each and every incarnation he speaks as much about religion as can be understood by the particular people under their particular circumstances but the mission is the same to lead people to god consciousness and obedience to the principles of religion sometimes he descends personally and sometimes he sends his bona fide representative in the form of his son or servant or himself in some disguised form the principles of the bhagavadgt were spoken to arjuna and for that matter to other highly elevated persons because he was highly advanced compared to ordinary persons in other parts of the world two plus two equals four is a mathematical principle that is true both in the beginners arithmetic class and in the advanced class as well still there are higher and lower mathematics in all incarnations of the lord therefore the same principles are taught but they appear to be higher and lower in varied circumstances the higher principles of religion begin with the acceptance of the four orders and the four statuses of social life as will be explained later the whole purpose of the mission of incarnations is to arouse ka consciousness everywhere such consciousness is manifest and nonmanifest only under different circumstances text 8 paritrya sdhn vinya ca duktm dharmasasthpanrthya

after millennium purport according to bhagavadgt a sdhu holyman is a man in ka consciousness a person may appear to be irreligious but if he has the qualifications of ka consciousness wholly and fully he is to be understood to be a sdhu and duktam applies to one who doesnt care for ka consciousness such miscreants or duktam are described as foolish and the lowest of mankind even though they may be decorated with mundane education whereas another person who is one hundred percent engaged in ka consciousness is accepted as sdhu even though such a person may neither be learned nor well cultured as far as the atheistic are concerned it is not necessary for the supreme lord to appear as he is to destroy them as he did with the demons rvaa and kasa the lord has many agents who are quite competent to vanquish demons but the lord especially descends to appease his unalloyed devotees who are always harassed by the demonic the demon harasses the devotee even though the latter may happen to be his kin although prahlda mahrja was the son of hirayakaipu he was nonetheless persecuted by his father although devak the mother of ka was the sister of kasa she and her husband vasudeva were persecuted only because ka was to be born of them so lord ka appeared primarily to deliver devak rather than kill kasa but both were performed simultaneously therefore it is said here that to deliver the devotee and vanquish the demon miscreants the lord appears in different incarnations in the caitanyacaritmta of kadsa kavirja the following verses summarize these principles of incarnation sihetu yei mrti prapace avatare sei varamrti avatra nma dhare mytita paravyome savra avasthna vive avatri dhare avatra nma the avatra or incarnation of godhead descends from the kingdom of god for material manifestation and the particular form of the personality of godhead who so descends is called an incarnation or avatra such incarnations are situated in the spiritual world the kingdom of god when they descend to the material creation they assume the name avatra there are various kinds of avatras such as puruvatras guvatras llvatras aktyvea avatras manvantaraavatras and yugvatras all appearing on schedule all over the universe but lord ka is the primeval lord the fountainhead of all avatras lord r ka descends for the specific purposes of mitigating the anxieties of the pure devotees who are very anxious to see him in his original vndvana pastimes therefore the prime purpose of the ka avatra is to satisfy his unalloyed devotees the lord says that he incarnates himself in every millennium this indicates that he incarnates also in the age of kali as stated in the rmadbhgavatam the incarnation in the age of kali is lord caitanya mahprabhu who spread the worship of ka by the sakrtana movement congregational chanting of the holy names and spread ka consciousness throughout india he predicted that this culture of sakrtana would be broadcast all over the world from town to town and village to village lord caitanya as the incarnation of ka the personality of godhead is described secretly but not directly in the confidential parts of the revealed scriptures such as the upaniads mahbhrata bhgavatam etc the devotees of lord ka are much attracted by the sakrtana movement of lord caitanya this avatra of the lord does not kill the miscreants but delivers them by the causeless mercy of the lord text 9 janma karma ca me divyam eva yo vetti tattvata tyaktv deha punar janma naiti mm eti so rjuna janmabirth karmawork caalso meof mine divyam transcendental evamlike this yaanyone

transcendental nature of my appearance and activities does not upon leaving the body take his birth again in this material world but attains my eternal abode o arjuna purport the lords descent from his transcendental abode is already explained in the 6th verse one who can understand the truth of the appearance of the personality of godhead is already liberated from material bondage and therefore he returns to the kingdom of god immediately after quitting this present material body such liberation of the living entity from material bondage is not at all easy the impersonalists and the yogs attain liberation only after much trouble and many many births even then the liberation they achievemerging into the impersonal brahmajyoti of the lordis only partial and there is the risk of returning again to this material world but the devotee simply by understanding the transcendental nature of the body and activities of the lord attains the abode of the lord after ending this body and does not run the risk of returning again to this material world in the brahmasahit it is stated that the lord has many many forms and incarnations advaitam acyutam andim anantarpam although there are many transcendental forms of the lord they are still one and the same supreme personality of godhead one has to understand this fact with conviction although it is incomprehensible to mundane scholars and empiric philosophers as stated in the vedas eko devo nityallnurakto bhaktavyp hdy antartm the one supreme personality of godhead is eternally engaged in many many transcendental forms in relationships with his unalloyed devotees this vedic version is confirmed in this verse of the gt personally by the lord he who accepts this truth on the strength of the authority of the vedas and of the supreme personality of godhead and who does not waste time in philosophical speculations attains the highest perfectional stage of liberation simply by accepting this truth on faith one can without a doubt attain liberation the vedic version tattvamasi is actually applied in this case anyone who understands lord ka to be the supreme or who says unto the lord you are the same supreme brahman the personality of godhead is certainly liberated instantly and consequently his entrance into the transcendental association of the lord is guaranteed in other words such a faithful devotee of the lord attains perfection and this is confirmed by the following vedic assertion tam eva viditvtimtyumeti nnya panth vidyate ayanya one can attain the perfect stage of liberation from birth and death simply by knowing the lord the supreme personality of godhead there is no alternative because anyone who does not understand lord ka as the supreme personality of godhead is surely in the mode of ignorance consequently he will not attain salvation simply so to speak by licking the outer surface of the bottle of honey or by interpreting the bhagavadgt according to mundane scholarship such empiric philosophers may assume very important roles in the material world but they are not necessarily eligible for liberation such puffed up mundane scholars have to wait for the causeless mercy of the devotee of the lord one should therefore cultivate ka consciousness with faith and knowledge and in this way attain perfection text 10 vtargabhayakrodh manmay mm uprit bahavo jnatapas pt madbhvam

gatattained translation being freed from attachment fear and anger being fully absorbed in me and taking refuge in me many many persons in the past became purifled by knowledge of meand thus they all attained transcendental love for me purport as described above it is very difficult for a person who is too materially affected to understand the personal nature of the supreme absolute truth generally people who are attached to the bodily conception of life are so absorbed in materialism that it is almost impossible for them to understand that there is a transcendental body which is imperishable full of knowledge and eternally blissful in the materialistic concept the body is perishable full of ignorance and completely miserable therefore people in general keep this same bodily idea in mind when they are informed of the personal form of the lord for such materialistic men the form of the gigantic material manifestation is supreme consequently they consider the supreme to be impersonal and because they are too materially absorbed the conception of retaining the personality after liberation from matter frightens them when they are informed that spiritual life is also individual and personal they become afraid of becoming persons again and so they naturally prefer a kind of merging into the impersonal void generally they compare the living entities to the bubbles of the ocean which merge into the ocean that is the highest perfection of spiritual existence attainable without individual personality this is a kind of fearful stage of life devoid of perfect knowledge of spiritual existence furthermore there are many persons who cannot understand spiritual existence at all being embarassed by so many theories and by contradictions of various types of philosophical speculation they become disgusted or angry and foolishly conclude that there is no supreme cause and that everything is ultimately void such people are in a diseased condition of life some people are too materially attached and therefore do not give attention to spiritual life some of them want to merge into the supreme spiritual cause and some of them disbelieve in everything being angry at all sorts of spiritual speculation out of hopelessness this last class of men take to the shelter of some kind of intoxication and their affective hallucinations are sometimes accepted as spiritual vision one has to get rid of all three stages of attachment to the material world negligence of spiritual life fear of a spiritual personal identity and the conception of void that underlies the frustration of life to get free from these three stages of the material concept of life one has to take complete shelter of the lord guided by the bona fide spiritual master and follow the disciplines and regulative principles of devotional life the last stage of the devotional life is called bhva or transcendental love of godhead according to bhaktirasmtasindhu the science of devotional service dau raddh tata sdhusago tha bhajanakriy tato narthanivtti syt tato nih rucis tata athsaktis tato bhvas tata prembhyudacati sdhaknm aya prema prdurbhve bhavet krama in the beginning one must have a preliminary desire for selfrealization this will bring one to the stage of trying to associate with persons who are spiritually elevated in next stage one becomes initiated by an elevated spiritual master and under his instruction the neophyte devotee begins the process of devotional service by execution of devotional service under the guidance of the spiritual master one becomes free from all material attachment attains steadiness in selfrealization and acquires a taste for hearing about the absolute personality of godhead r ka this taste leads one further forward to attachment for ka consciousness which is matured in bhva or the preliminary stage of transcendental love of god real love for god is called prem the highest perfectional stage of life in the prem stage there is constant engagement in the transcendental loving service of the lord so by the slow process of devotional service under the guidance of the bona fide spiritual master one can attain the highest stage being freed from all material attachment from the fearfulness of ones individual spiritual personality and from the frustrations resulting from void philosophy then one can ultimately attain to the abode of the supreme lord text 11 ye yath m prapadyante ts tathaiva bhajmy aham mama vartmnuvartante manuy prtha sarvaa yeall of them yathas mmunto me prapadyantesurrender tn unto them

accordingly everyone follows my path in all respects o son of pth purport eveyone is searching for ka in the different aspects of his manifestations ka the supreme personality of godhead is partially realized in his impersonal brahmajyoti effulgence and as the allpervading supersoul dwelling within everything including the particles of atoms but ka is only fully realized by his pure devotees consequently ka is the object of everyones realization and thus anyone and everyone is satisfied according to ones desire to have him in the transcendental world also ka reciprocates with his pure devotees in the transcendental attitude just as the devotee wants him one devotee may want ka as supreme master another as his personal friend another as his son and still another as his lover ka rewards all the devotees equally according to their different intensities of love for him in the material world the same reciprocations of feelings are there and they are equally exchanged by the lord with the different types of worshipers the pure devotees both here and in the transcendental abode associate with him in person and are able to render personal service to the lord and thus derive transcendental bliss in his loving service as for those who are impersonalists and who want to commit spiritual suicide by annihilating the individual existence of the living entity ka helps also by absorbing them into his effulgence such impersonalists do not agree to accept the eternal blissful personality of godhead consequently they cannot relish the bliss of transcendental personal service to the lord having extinguished their individuality some of them who are not situated even in the impersonal existence return to this material field to exhibit their dormant desires for activities they are not admitted in the spiritual planets but they are again given a chance to act on the material planets for those who are fruitive workers the lord awards the desired results of their prescribed duties as the yajevara and those who are yogs seeking mystic powers are awarded such powers in other words everyone is dependant for success upon his mercy alone and all kinds of spiritual processes are but different degrees of success on the same path unless therefore one comes to the highest perfection of ka consciousness all attempts remain imperfect as is stated in the rmadbhgavatam akma sarvakmo v mokakma udradh tvrea bhaktiyogena yajeta purua param whether one is without desire the condition of the devotees or is desirous of all fruitive results or is after liberation one should with all efforts try to worship the supreme personality of godhead for complete perfection culminating in ka consciousness bhg 2310 text 12 kkanta karma siddhi yajanta iha devat kipra hi mnue

although passing as great scholars take these demigods to be various forms of the supreme lord actually the demigods are not different forms of god but they are gods different parts and parcels god is one and the parts and parcels are many the vedas say nityo nitynm god is one vara parama ka the supreme god is onekaand the demigods are delegated with powers to manage this material world these demigods are all living entities nitynm with different grades of material power they cannot be equal to the supreme godnryaa viu or ka anyone who thinks that god and the demigods are on the same level is called an atheist or pa even the great demigods like brahm and iva cannot be compared to the supreme lord in fact the lord is worshiped by demigods such as brahm and iva ivaviricinutam yet curiously enough there are many human leaders who are worshiped by foolish men under the misunderstanding of anthropomorphism or zoomorphism iha devat denotes a powerful man or demigod of this material world but nryaa viu or ka the supreme personality of godhead does not belong to this world he is above or transcendental to material creation even rpda akarcrya the leader of the impersonalists maintains that nryaa or ka is beyond this material creation however foolish people htajana worship the demigods because they want immediate results they get the results but do not know that results so obtained are temporary and are meant for less intelligent persons the intelligent person is in ka consciousness and he has no need to worship the paltry demigods for some immediate temporary benefit the demigods of this material world as well as their worshipers will vanish with the annihilation of this material world the boons of the demigods are material and temporary both the material worlds and their inhabitants including the demigods and their worshipers are bubbles in the cosmic ocean in this world however human society is mad after temporary things such as the material opulence of possessing land family and enjoyable paraphernalia to achieve such temporary things they worship the demigods or powerful men in human society if a man gets some ministership in the government by worshiping a political leader he considers that he has achieved a great boon all of them are therefore kowtowing to the socalled leaders or big guns in order to achieve temporary boons and they indeed achieve such things such foolish men are not interested in ka consciousness for the permanent solution to the hardships of material existence they are all after sense enjoyment and to get a little facility for sense enjoyment they are attracted to worship empowered living entities known as demigods this verse indicates that people are rarely interested in ka consciousness they are mostly interested in material enjoyment and therefore they worship some powerful living entity text 13 cturvarya may sa guakarmavibhgaa tasya kartram api m viddhy akartram avyayam cturvaryamthe four divisions of human society mayby me samcreated guaquality karmawork vibhgaain terms of division tasyaof that kartramthe father apialthough mmme viddhiyou may know akartramas the nondoer avyayambeing unchangeable translation according to the three modes of material nature and the work ascribed to them the four divisions of human society were created by me and although i am the creator of this system you should know that i am yet the nondoer being unchangeable purport the lord is the creator of everything everything is born of him everything is sustained by him and everything after annihilation rests in him he is therefore the creator of the four divisions of the social order beginning with the intelligent class of men technically called brhmaas due to their being situated in the mode of goodness next is the administrative class technically called the katriyas due to their being situated in the mode of passion the mercantile men called the vaiyas are situated in the mixed modes of passion and ignorance and the dras or laborer class are situated in the ignorant mode of material nature in spite of his creating the four divisions of human society lord ka does not belong to any of these divisions because he is not one of the conditioned souls a section of whom form human society human society is similar to any other animal society but to elevate men from the animal status the abovementioned divisions are created by the lord for the systematic development of ka consciousness the tendency of a particular man toward work is determined by the modes of material nature which he has acquired such symptoms of life according to different modes of material nature are described in the eighteenth chapter of this book a person in ka consciousness however is above even the brhmaas because a brhmaa by quality is supposed to know about brahman the supreme absolute truth most of them approach the impersonal brahman manifestation of lord ka but only a man who transcends the limited knowledge of a brhmaa and reaches the knowledge of the supreme personality of godhead lord r ka becomes a person in ka consciousnessor in other words a vaiava ka consciousness includes knowledge of all different plenary expansions of ka namely rma nsiha varha etc however as ka is transcendental to this system of the four divisions of human society a person in ka consciousness is also transcendental to all divisions of human society whether we consider the divisions of community nation or species text 14 na m karmi limpanti na me karmaphale sph iti m yo

karmabhi by the reaction of such work nanever does sahe badhyatebecome entangled translation there is no work that affects me nor do i aspire for the fruits of action one who understands this truth about me also does not become entangled in the fruitive reactions of work purport as there are constitutional laws in the material world stating that the king can do no wrong or that the king is not subject to the state laws similarly the lord although he is the creator of this material world is not affected by the activities of the material world he creates and remains aloof from the creation whereas the living entities are entangled in the fruitive results of material activities because of their propensity for lording it over material resources the proprietor of an establishment is not responsible for the right and wrong activities of the workers but the workers are themselves responsible the living entities are engaged in their respective activities of sense gratification and these activities are not ordained by the lord for advancement of sense gratification the living entities are engaged in the work of this world and they aspire to heavenly happiness after death the lord being full in himself has no attraction for socalled heavenly happiness the heavenly demigods are only his engaged servants the proprietor never desires the lowgrade happiness such as the workers may desire he is aloof from the material actions and reactions for example the rains are not responsible for different types of vegetation that appear on the earth although without such rains there is no possibility of vegetative growth vedic smti confirms this fact as follows nimittamtram evsau sjyn sargakarmai pradhnakrabht yato vai sjyaaktaya in the material creations the lord is only the supreme cause the immediate cause is material nature by which the cosmic manifestation is visible the created beings are of many varieties such as the demigods human beings and lower animals and all of them are subject to the reactions of their past good or bad activities the lord only gives them the proper facilities for such activities and the regulations of the modes of nature but he is never responsible for their past and present activities in the vedntastras it is confirmed that the lord is never partial to any living entity the living entity is responsible for his own acts the lord only gives him facilities through the agency of material nature the external energy anyone who is fully conversant with all the intricacies of this law of karma or fruitive activities does not become affected by the results of his activities in other words the person who understands this transcendental nature of the lord is an experienced man in ka consciousness and thus he is never subjected to the laws of karma one who does not know the transcendental nature of the lord and who thinks that the activities of the lord are aimed at fruitive results as are the activities of the ordinary living entities certainly becomes entangled himself in fruitive reaction but one who knows the supreme truth is a liberated soul fixed in ka consciousness text 15 eva jtv kta karma prvair api mumukubhi kuru

attained liberation therefore as the ancients you should perform your duty in this divine consciousness purport there are two classes of men some of them are full of polluted material things within their hearts and some of them are materially free ka consciousness is equally beneficial for both of these persons those who are full of dirty things can take to the line of ka consciousness for a gradual cleansing process following the regulative principles of devotional service those who are already cleansed of the impurities may continue to act in the same ka consciousness so that others may follow their exemplary activities and thereby be benefitted foolish persons or neophytes in ka consciousness often want to retire from activities without having knowledge of ka consciousness arjunas desire to retire from activities on the battlefield was not approved by the lord one need only know how to act to retire from the activities of ka consciousness and to sit aloof making a show of ka consciousness is less important than actually engaging in the field of activities for the sake of ka arjuna is here advised to act in ka consciousness following in the footsteps of the lords previous disciples such as the sungod vivasvn as mentioned hereinbefore the supreme lord knows all his past activities as well as those of persons who acted in ka consciousness in the past therefore he recommends the acts of the sungod who learned this art from the lord some millions of years before all such students of lord ka are mentioned here as past liberated persons engaged in the discharge of duties allotted by ka text 16 ki karma kim akarmeti kavayo py atra mohit tat te karma pravakymi yaj jtv mokyase ubht kimwhat is karmaaction kimwhat is akarmainaction itithus kavayathe intelligent

bewildered in determining what is action and what is inaction now i shall explain to you what action is knowing which you shall be liberated from all sins purport action in ka consciousness has to be executed in accord with the examples of previous bona fide devotees this is recommended in the 15th verse why such action should not be independant will be explained in the text to follow to act in ka consciousness one has to follow the leadership of authorized persons who are in a line of disciplic succession as explained in the beginning of this chapter the system of ka consciousness was first narrated to the sungod the sungod explained it to his son manu manu explained it to his son ikvku and the system is current on this earth from that very remote time therefore one has to follow in the footsteps of previous authorities in the line of disciplic succession otherwise even the most intelligent men will be bewildered regarding the standard actions of ka consciousness for this reason the lord decided to instruct arjuna in ka consciousness directly because of the direct instruction of the lord to arjuna anyone who follows in the footsteps of arjuna is certainly not bewildered it is said that one cannot ascertain the ways of religion simply by imperfect experimental knowledge actually the principles of religion can only be laid down by the lord himself dharma hi skt bhagavatpratam no one can manufacture a religious principle by imperfect speculation one must follow in the footsteps of great authorities like brahm iva nrada manu kumra kapila prahlda bhma ukadeva gosvm yamarja janaka etc by mental speculation one cannot ascertain what is religion or selfrealization therefore out of causeless mercy to his devotees the lord explains directly to arjuna what action is and what inaction is only action performed in ka consciousness can deliver a person from the entanglement of material existence text 17 karmao hy api boddhavya boddhavya ca vikarmaa akarmaa

forbidden action is and what inaction is purport if one is serious about liberation from material bondage one has to understand the distinctions between action inaction and unauthorized actions one has to apply oneself to such an analysis of action reaction and perverted actions because it is a very difficult subject matter to understand ka consciousness and action according to the modes one has to learn ones relationship with the supreme ie one who has learned perfectly knows that every living entity is the eternal servitor of the lord and that consequently one has to act in ka consciousness the entire bhagavadgt is directed toward this conclusion any other conclusions against this consciousness and its attendant reactions are vikarmas or prohibitive actions to understand all this one has to associate with authorities in ka consciousness and learn the secret from them this is as good as learning from the lord directly otherwise even the most intelligent person will be bewildered text

in inaction is intelligent among men and he is in the tranecendental position although engaged in all sorts of activities purport a person acting in ka consciousness is naturally free from the bonds of karma his activities are all performed for ka therefore he does not enjoy or suffer any of the effects of work consequently he is intelligent in human society even though he is engaged in all sorts of activities for ka akarma means without reaction to work the impersonalist ceases fruitive activities out of fear so that the resultant action may not be a stumbling block on the path of selfrealization but the personalist knows rightly his position as the eternal servitor of the supreme personality of godhead therefore he engages himself in the activities of ka consciousness because everything is done for ka he enjoys only transcendental happiness in the discharge of this service those who are engaged in this process are known to be without desire for personal sense gratification the sense of eternal servitorship to ka makes one immune to all sorts of reactionary elements of work text 19 yasya sarve samrambh kmasakalpavarjit jngnidagdhakarma tam hu paita budh yasyaone whose

fruitive action is burned up by the fire of perfect knowledge purport only a person in full knowledge can understand the activities of a person in ka consciousness because the person in ka consciousness is devoid of all kinds of sensegratificatory propensities it is to be understood that he has burned up the reactions of his work by perfect knowledge of his constitutional position as the eternal servitor of the supreme personality of godhead he is actually learned who has attained to such perfection of knowledge development of this knowledge of the eternal servitorship of the lord is compared to fire such a fire once kindled can burn up all kinds of reactions to work text 20 tyaktv karmaphalsaga nityatpto nirraya karmay abhipravtto pi naiva kicit karoti sa tyaktvhaving given up

undertakings purport this freedom from the bondage of actions is possible only in ka consciousness when one is doing everything for ka a ka conscious person acts out of pure love for the supreme personality of godhead and therefore he has no attraction for the results of the action he is not even attached to his personal maintenance for everything is left to ka nor is he anxious to secure things nor to protect things already in his possession he does his duty to his best ability and leaves everything to ka such an unattached person is always free from the resultant reactions of good and bad it is as though he were not doing anything this is the sign of akarma or actions without fruitive reactions any other action therefore devoid of ka consciousness is binding upon the worker and that is the real aspect of vikarma as explained hereinbefore text 21 nirr yatacitttm tyaktasarvaparigraha rra kevala karma kurvan npnoti kilbiam nirwithout desire for the results yatacontrolled

acts only for the bare necessities of life thus working he is not affected by sinful reactions purport a ka conscious person does not expect good or bad results in his activities his mind and intelligence are fully controlled he knows that he is part and parcel of the supreme and therefore the part played by him as a part and parcel of the whole is not his by choice but is chosen for him by the supreme and is done only through his agency when the hand moves it does not move out of its own accord but by the endeavor of the whole body a ka conscious person is always dovetailed with the supreme desire for he has no desire for personal sense gratification he moves exactly like a part of a machine as a machine part requires oiling and cleaning for maintenance similarly a ka conscious man maintains himself by his work just to remain fit for action in the transcendental loving service of the lord he is therefore immune to all the reactions of his endeavors like an animal he has no proprietorship even over his own body a cruel proprietor of an animal sometimes kills the animal in his possession yet the animal does not protest nor does it have any real independence a ka conscious person fully engaged in self realization has very little time to falsely possess any material object for maintaining body and soul he does not require unfair means of accumulating money he does not therefore become contaminated by such material sins he is free from all reactions to his actions text 22 yadcchlbhasantuo dvandvtto vimatsara sama siddhv asiddhau ca ktvpi na nibadhyate yadcchout of

translation he who is satisfied with gain which comes of its own accord who is free from duality and does not envy who is steady both in success and failure is never entangled although performing actions purport a ka conscious person does not make much endeavor even to maintain his body he is satisfied with gains which are obtained of their own accord he neither begs nor borrows but he labors honestly as far as is in his power and is satisfied with whatever is obtained by his own honest labor he is therefore independent in his livelihood he does not allow anyones service to hamper his own service in ka consciousness however for the service of the lord he can participate in any kind of action without being disturbed by the duality of the material world the duality of the material world is felt in terms of heat and cold or misery and happiness a ka conscious person is above duality because he does not hesitate to act in any way for the satisfaction of ka therefore he is steady both in success and in failure these signs are visible when one is fully in transcendental knowledge text 23 gatasagasya muktasya jnvasthitacetasa yajycarata karma samagra pravilyate gatasagasyaunattached

purport becoming fully ka conscious one is freed from all dualities and thus is free from the contaminations of the material modes he can become liberated because he knows his constitutional position in relationship with ka and thus his mind cannot be drawn from ka consciousness consequently whatever he does he does for ka who is the primeval viu therefore all his works are technically sacrifices because sacrifice involves satisfying the supreme person ka the resultant reactions to all such work certainly merge into transcendence and one does not suffer material effects text 24 brahmrpaa

fully absorbed in ka consciousness is sure to attain the spiritual kingdom because of his full contribution to spiritual activities in which the consummation is absolute and that which is offered is of the same spiritual nature purport how activities in ka consciousness can lead one ultimately to the spiritual goal is described here there are various activities in ka consciousness and all of them will be described in the following verses but for the present just the principle of ka consciousness is described a conditioned soul entangled in material contamination is sure to act in the material atmosphere and yet he has to get out of such an environment the process by which the conditioned soul can get out of the material atmosphere is ka consciousness for example a patient who is suffering from a disorder of the bowels due to overindulgence in milk products is cured by another milk product namely curds the materially absorbed conditioned soul can be cured by ka consciousness as set forth here in the gt this process is generally known as yaja or activities sacrifices simply meant for the satisfaction of viu or ka the more the activities of the material world are performed in ka consciousness or for viu only the more the atmosphere becomes spiritualized by complete absorption brahman means spiritual the lord is spiritual and the rays of his transcendental body are called brahmajyoti his spiritual effulgence everything that exists is situated in that brahmajyoti but when the jyoti is covered by illusion my or sense gratification it is called material this material veil can be removed at once by ka consciousness thus the offering for the sake of ka consciousness the consuming agent of such an offering or contribution the process of consumption the contributor and the result areall combined togetherbrahman or the absolute truth the absolute truth covered by my is called matter matter dovetailed for the cause of the absolute truth regains its spiritual quality ka consciousness is the process of converting the illusory consciousness into brahman or the supreme when the mind is fully absorbed in ka consciousness it is said to be in samdhi or trance anything done in such transcendental consciousness is called yaja or sacrifice for the absolute in that condition of spiritual consciousness the contributor the contribution the consumption the performer or leader

in the fire of the supreme brahman purport as described above a person engaged in discharging duties in ka consciousness is also called a perfect yog or a firstclass mystic but there are others also who perform similar sacrifices in the worship of demigods and still others who sacrifice to the supreme brahman or the impersonal feature of the supreme lord so there are different kinds of sacrifices in terms of different categories such different categories of sacrifice by different types of performers only superficially demark varieties of sacrifice factual sacrifice means to satisfy the supreme lord viu who is also known as yaja all the different varieties of sacrifice can be placed within two primary divisions namely sacrifice of worldly possessions and sacrifice in pursuit of transcendental knowledge those who are in ka consciousness sacrifice all material possessions for the satisfaction of the supreme lord while others who want some temporary material happiness sacrifice their material possessions to satisfy demigods such as indra the sungod etc and others who are impersonalists sacrifice their identity by merging into the existence of impersonal brahman the demigods are powerful living entities appointed by the supreme lord for the maintenance and supervision of all material functions like the heating watering and lighting of the universe those who are interested in material benefits worship the demigods by various sacrifices according to the vedic rituals they are called bahvvaravd or believers in many gods but others who worship the impersonal feature of the absolute truth and regard the forms of the demigods as temporary sacrifice their individual selves in the supreme fire and thus end their individual existences by merging into the existence of the supreme such impersonalists spend their time in philosophical speculation to understand the transcendental nature of the supreme in other words the fruitive workers sacrifice their material possessions for material enjoyment whereas the impersonalist sacrifices his material designations with a view to merging into the existence of the supreme for the impersonalist the fire altar of sacrifice is the supreme brahman and the offering is the self being consumed by the fire of brahman the ka conscious person like arjuna however sacrifices everything for the satisfaction of ka and thus all his material possessions as well as his own selfeverythingis sacrificed for ka thus he is the firstclass yog but he does not lose his individual existence text 26 rotrdnndriyy anye sayamgniu

sacrifice the objects of the senses such as sound in the fire of sacrifice purport the four divisions of human life namely the brahmacr the ghastha the vnaprastha and the sannys are all meant to help men become perfect yogs or transcendentalists since human life is not meant for our enjoying sense gratification like the animals the four orders of human life are so arranged that one may become perfect in spiritual life the brahmacrs or students under the care of a bona fide spiritual master control the mind by abstaining from sense gratification they are referred to in this verse as sacrificing the hearing process and the senses in the fire of the controlled mind a brahmacr hears only words concerning ka consciousness hearing is the basic principle for understanding and therefore the pure brahmacr engages fully in harer nmnukrtanamchanting and hearing the glories of the lord he restrains himself from the vibrations of material sounds and his hearing is engaged in the transcendental sound vibration of hare ka hare ka similarly the householders who have some license for sense gratification perform such acts with great restraint sex life intoxication and meat eating are general tendencies of human society but a regulated householder does not indulge in unrestricted sex life and other sense gratifications marriage on principles of religious life is therefore current in all civilized human society because that is the way for restricted sex life this restricted unattached sex life is also a kind of yaja because the restricted householder sacrifices his general tendency toward sense gratification for higher transcendental life text 27 sarvndriyakarmi prakarmi cpare tmasayamayoggnau juhvati jnadpite sarviall indriyasenses karmifunctions prakarmi

who are interested in selfrealization in terms of mind and sense control offer the functions of all the senses as well as the vital force breath as oblations into the fire of the controlled mind purport the yoga system conceived by patajali is referred to herein in the yogastra of patajali the soul is called pratyagtm and paragtm as long as the soul is attached to sense enjoyment it is called paragtm the soul is subjected to the functions of ten kinds of air at work within the body and this is perceived through the breathing system the ptajala system of yoga instructs one on how to control the functions of the bodys air in a technical manner so that ultimately all the functions of the air within become favorable for purifying the soul of material attachment according to this yoga system pratyag tm is the ultimate goal this pratyag tm is a withdrawal from activities in matter the senses interact with the sense objects like the ear for hearing eyes for seeing nose for smelling tongue for tasting hand for touching and all of them are thus engaged in activities outside the self they are called the functions of the pravyu the apnavyu goes downwards vynavyu acts to shrink and expand samnavyu adjusts equilibrium udnavyu goes upwardsand when one is enlightened one engages all these in searching for selfrealization text 28 dravyayajs tapoyaj yogayajs tathpare svdhyyajnayaj ca yataya

austerities take strict vows and practice the yoga of eightfold mysticism and others study the vedas for the advancement of transcendental knowledge purport these sacrifices may be fitted into various divisions there are persons who are sacrificing their possessions in the form of various kinds of charities in india the rich mercantile community or princely orders open various kinds of charitable institutions like dharmal annaketra atithil anathalaya vidypha etc in other countries too there are many hospitals old age homes and similar charitable foundations meant for distributing food education and medical treatment free to the poor all these charitable activities are called dravyamayayaja there are others who for higher elevation in life or for promotion to higher planets within the universe voluntarily accept many kinds of austerities such as candryana and cturmsya these processes entail severe vows for conducting life under certain rigid rules for example under the cturmsya vow the candidate does not shave for four months during the year july to october he does not eat certain foods does not eat twice in a day and does not leave home such sacrifice of the comforts of life is called tapomayayaja there are still others who engage themselves in different kinds of mystic yogas like the patajali system for merging into the existence of the absolute or hahayoga or agayoga for particular perfections and some travel to all the sanctified places of pilgrimage all these practices are called yogayaja sacrifice for a certain type of perfection in the material world there are others who engage themselves in the studies of different vedic literatures specifically the upaniads and vedntastras or the skhya philosophy all of these are called svdhyyayaja or engagement in the sacrifice of studies all these yogs are faithfully engaged in different types of sacrifice and are seeking a higher status of life ka consciousness is however different from these because it is the direct service of the supreme lord ka consciousness cannot be attained by any one of the abovementioned types of sacrifices but can be attained only by the mercy of the lord and his bona fide devotee therefore ka consciousness is transcendental text 29 apne juhvati pra pre pna tathpare prpnagat ruddhv prymaparya apare niyathr prn preu juhvati apneair which acts downward juhvatioffers

process of breath restraint to remain in trance and they practice stopping the movement of the outgoing breath into the incoming and incoming breath into the outgoing and thus at last remain in trance stopping all breathing some of them curtailing the eating process offer the outgoing breath into itself as a sacrifice purport this system of yoga for controlling the breathing process is called pryma and in the beginning it is practiced in the hahayoga system through different sitting postures all of these processes are recommended for controlling the senses and for advancement in spiritual realization this practice involves controlling the air within the body to enable simultaneous passage in opposite directions the apna air goes downward and the pra air goes up the pryma yog practices breathing the opposite way until the currents are neutralized into praka equilibrium similarly when the exhaled breathing is offered to inhaled breathing it is called recaka when both air currents are completely stopped it is called kumbhakayoga by practice of kumbhakayoga the yogs increase the duration of life by many many years a ka conscious person however being always situated in the transcendental loving service of the lord automatically becomes the controller of the senses his senses being always engaged in the service of ka have no chance of becoming otherwise engaged so at the end of life he is naturally transferred to the transcendental plane of lord ka consequently he makes no attempt to increase his longevity he is at once raised to the platform of liberation a ka conscious person begins from the transcendental stage and he is constantly in that consciousness therefore there is no falling down and ultimately he enters into the abode of the lord without delay the practice of reduced eating is automatically done when one eats only ka prasdam or food which is offered first to the lord reducing the eating process is very helpful in the matter of sense control and without sense control there is no possibility of getting out of the material entanglement text 30 sarve py ete yajavido yajakapitakalma yajaimtabhujo ynti brahma santanam sarveall apialthough

such performances of yaja amtabhujathose who have tasted such nectar yntido approach brahmathe supreme santanameternal atmosphere translation all these performers who know the meaning of sacrifice become cleansed of sinful reaction and having tasted the nectar of the remnants of such sacrifice they go to the supreme eternal atmosphere purport from the foregoing explanation of differents types of sacrifice namely sacrifice of ones possessions study of the vedas or philosophical doctrines and performance of the yoga system it is found that the common aim of all is to control the senses sense gratification is the root cause of material existence therefore unless and until one is situated on a platform apart from sense gratification there is no chance of being elevated to the eternal platform of full knowledge full bliss and full life this platform is in the eternal atmosphere or brahman atmosphere all the abovementioned sacrifices help one to become cleansed of the sinful reactions of material existence by this advancement in life one not only becomes happy and opulent in this life but also at the end he enters into the eternal kingdom of god either merging into the impersonal brahman or associating with the supreme personality of godhead ka text 31 nya loko sty ayajasya kuto nya kurusattama nanever ayamthis lokaplanet astithere is ayajasyaof the foolish kutawhere is anyathe other kurusattamao best amongst the kurus translation o best of the kuru dynasty without sacrifice one can never live happily on this planet or in this life what then of the next purport whatever form of material existence one is in one is invariably ignorant of his real situation in other words existence in the material world is due to the multiple reactions to our sinful lives ignorance is the cause of sinful life and sinful life is the cause of ones dragging on in material existence the human form of life is the only loophole by which one may get out of this entanglement the vedas therefore give us a chance for escape by pointing out the paths of religion economic comfort regulated sense gratification and at last the means to get out of the miserable condition entirely the path of religion or the different kinds of sacrifice recommended above automatically solves our economic problems by performance of yaja we can have enough food enough milk etceven if there is a socalled increase of population when the body is fully supplied naturally the next stage is to satisfy the senses the vedas prescribe therefore sacred marriage for regulated sense gratification thereby one is gradually elevated to the platform of release from material bondage and the highest perfection of liberated life is to associate with the supreme lord perfection is achieved by performance of yaja sacrifice as described above now if a person is not inclined to perform yaja according to the vedas how can he expect a happy life there are different grades of material comforts in different heavenly planets and in all cases there is immense happiness for persons engaged in different kinds of yaja but the highest kind of happiness that a man can achieve is to be promoted to the spiritual planets by practice of ka consciousness a life of ka consciousness is therefore the solution to all the problems of material existence text 32 eva bahuvidh yaj vitat

them as such you will become liberated purport different types of sacrifice as discussed above are mentioned in the vedas to suit the different types of worker because men are so deeply absorbed in the bodily concept these sacrifices are so arranged that one can work either with the body the mind or the intelligence but all of them are recommended for ultimately bringing about liberation from the body this is confirmed by the lord herewith from his own mouth text 33 reyn dravyamayd yajj jnayaja parantapa sarva karmkhila prtha jne parisampyate reyngreater dravyamaytthan the sacrifice of

translation o chastiser of the enemy the sacrifice of knowledge is greater than the sacrifice of material possessions o son of pth after all the sacrifice of work culminates in transcendental knowledge purport the purpose of all sacrifices is to arrive at the status of complete knowledge then to gain release from material miseries and ultimately to engage in loving transcendental service to the supreme lord ka consciousness nonetheless there is a mystery about all these different activities of sacrifice and one should know this mystery sacrifices sometimes take different forms according to the particular faith of the performer when ones faith reaches the stage of transcendental knowledge the performer of sacrifices should be considered more advanced than those who simply sacrifice material possessions without such knowledge for without attainment of knowledge sacrifices remain on the material platform and bestow no spiritual benefit real knowledge culminates in ka consciousness the highest stage of transcendental knowledge without the elevation of knowledge sacrifices are simply material activities when however they are elevated to the level of transcendental knowledge all such activities enter onto the spiritual platform depending on differences in consciousness sacrificial activities are sometimes called karma ka fruitive activities and sometimes jnaka knowledge in the pursuit of truth it is better when the end is knowledge text 34 tad viddhi praiptena paripranena sevay upadekyanti te jna jninas tattvadarina tatthat knowledge of different sacrifices

selfrealized tattvatruth darinathe seers translation just try to learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master inquire from him submissively and render service unto him the selfrealized soul can impart knowledge unto you because he has seen the truth purport the path of spiritual realization is undoubtedly difficult the lord therefore advises us to approach a bona fide spiritual master in the line of disciplic succession from the lord himself no one can be a bona fides piritual master without following this principle of disciplic succession the lord is the original spiritual master and a person in the disciplic succession can convey the message of the lord as it is to his disciple no one can be spiritually realized by manufacturing his own process as is the fashion of the foolish pretenders the bhgavatam says dharma hi skdbhagavatpratamthe path of religion is directly enunciated by the lord therefore mental speculation or dry arguments cannot help one progress in spiritual life one has to approach a bona fide spiritual master to receive the knowledge such a spiritual master should be accepted in full surrender and one should serve the spiritual master like a menial servant without false prestige satisfaction of the selfrealized spiritual master is the secret of advancement in spiritual life inquiries and submission constitute the proper combination for spiritual understanding unless there is submission and service inquiries from the learned spiritual master will not be effective one must be able to pass the test of the spiritual master and when he sees the genuine desire of the disciple he automatically blesses the disciple with genuine spiritual understanding in this verse both blind following and absurd inquiries are condemned one should not only hear submissively from the spiritual master but one must also get a clear understanding from him in submission and service and inquiries a bona fide spiritual master is by nature very kind toward the disciple therefore when the student is submissive and is always ready to render service the reciprocation of knowledge and inquiries becomes perfect text 35 yaj jtv na punar moham eva ysyasi pava yena

and are mine purport the result of receiving knowledge from a selfrealized soul or one who knows things as they are is learning that all living beings are parts and parcels of the supreme personality of godhead lord r ka the sense of a separated existence from ka is called my mnot ythis some think that we have nothing to do with ka that ka is only a great historical personality and that the absolute is the impersonal brahman factually as it is stated in the bhagavadgt this impersonal brahman is the personal effulgence of ka ka as the supreme personality of godhead is the cause of everything in the brahmasahit it is clearly stated that ka is the supreme personality of godhead the cause of all causes even the millions of incarnations are only his different expansions similarly the living entities are also expansions of ka the myvd philosophers wrongly think that ka loses his own separate existence in his many expansions this thought is material in nature we have experience in the material world that a thing when fragmentally distributed loses its own original identity but the myvd philosophers fail to understand that absolute means that one plus one is equal to one and that one minus one is also equal to one this is the case in the absolute world for want of sufficient knowledge in the absolute science we are now covered with illusion and therefore we think that we are separate from ka although we are separated parts of ka we are nevertheless not different from him the bodily difference of the living entities is my or not actual fact we are all meant to satisfy ka by my alone arjuna thought that the temporary bodily relationship with his kinsmen was more important than his eternal spiritual relationship with ka the whole teaching of the gt is targetted toward this end that a living being as his eternal servitor cannot be separated from ka and his sense of being an identity apart from ka is called my the living entities as separate parts and parcels of the supreme have a purpose to fulfill having forgotten that purpose since time immemorial they are situated in different bodies as men animals demigods etc such bodily differences arise from forgetfulness of the transcendental service of the lord but when one is engaged in transcendental service through ka consciousness one becomes at once liberated from this illusion one can acquire such pure knowledge only from the bona fide spiritual master and thereby avoid the delusion that the living entity is equal to ka perfect knowledge is that the supreme soul ka is the supreme shelter for all living entities and giving up such shelter the living entities are deluded by the material energy imagining themselves to have a separate identity thus under different standards of material identity they become forgetful of ka when however such deluded living entities become situated in ka consciousness it is to be understood that they are on the path of liberation as confirmed in the bhgavatam muktir hitvnyath rpa svarpea vyavasthiti liberation means to be situated in ones constitutional position as the eternal servitor of ka ka consciousness text 36 api ced asi ppebhya sarvebhya

in the boat of transcendental knowledge you will be able to cross over the ocean of miseries purport proper understanding of ones constitutional position in relationship to ka is so nice that it can at once lift one from the struggle for existence which goes on in the ocean of nescience this material world is sometimes regarded as an ocean of nescience and sometimes as a blazing forest in the ocean however expert a swimmer one may be the struggle for existence is very severe if someone comes forward and lifts the struggling swimmer from the ocean he is the greatest savior perfect knowledge

knowledge ignorance is the cause of our bondage and knowledge is the cause of our liberation this knowledge is the mature fruit of devotional service and when one is situated in transcendental

standard revealed scriptures and some even though they have knowledge of or can cite passages from the revealed scriptures have actually no faith in these words and even though others may have faith in scriptures like bhagavadgt they do not believe in or worship the personality of godhead r ka such persons cannot have any standing in ka consciousness they fall down out of all the abovementioned persons those who have no faith and are always doubtful make no progress at all men without faith in god and his revealed word find no good in this world nor in the next for them there is no happiness whatsoever one should therefore follow the principles of revealed scriptures with faith and thereby be raised to the platform of knowledge only this knowledge will help one become promoted to the transcendental platform of spiritual understanding in other words doubtful persons have no status whatsoever in spiritual emancipation one should therefore follow in the footsteps of great cryas who are in the disciplic succession and thereby attain success text 41 yogasannyastakarma jnasachinnasaayam tmavanta na karmi nibadhnanti dhanajaya yogadevotional service in karmayoga sannyastarenounced

yogamin yoga tihabe situated uttihastand up to fight bhrata o descendant of bharata translation therefore the doubts which have arisen in your heart out of ignorance should be slashed by the weapon of knowledge armed with yoga o bhrata stand and fight purport the yoga system instructed in this chapter is called santanayoga or eternal activities performed by the living entity this yoga has two divisions of sacrificial actions one is called sacrifice of ones material possessions and the other is called knowledge of self which is pure spiritual activity if sacrifice of ones material possessions is not dovetailed for spiritual realization then such sacrifice becomes material but one who performs such sacrifices with a spiritual objective or in devotional service makes a perfect sacrifice when we come to spiritual activities we find that these are also divided into two namely understanding of ones own self or ones constitutional position and the truth regarding the supreme personality of godhead one who follows the path of the gt as it is can very easily understand these two important divisions of spiritual knowledge for him there is no difficulty in obtaining perfect knowledge of the self as part and parcel of the lord and such understanding is beneficial for such a person who easily understands the transcendental activities of the lord in the beginning of this chapter the transcendental activities of the lord were discussed by the supreme lord himself one who does not understand the instructions of the gt is faithless and is to be considered to be misusing the fragmental independence awarded to him by the lord in spite of such instructions one who does not understand the real nature of the lord as the eternal blissful allknowing personality of godhead is certainly fool number one ignorance can be removed by gradual acceptance of the principles of ka consciousness ka consciousness is awakened by different types of sacrifices to the demigods sacrifice to brahman sacrifice in celibacy in household life in controlling the senses in practicing mystic yoga in penance in foregoing material possessions in studying the vedas and in partaking of the social institution called varramadharma all of these are known as sacrifice and all of them are based on regulated action but within all these activities the important factor is selfrealization one who seeks that objective is the real student of bhagavadgt but one who doubts the authority of ka falls back one is therefore advised to study bhagavadgt or any other scripture under a bona fide spiritual master with service and surrender a bona fide spiritual master is in the disciplic succession from time eternal and he does not deviate at all from the instructions of the supreme lord as they were imparted millions of years ago to the sungod from whom the instructions of bhagavadgt have come down to the earthly kingdom one should therefore follow the path of bhagavadgt as it is expressed in the gt itself and beware of selfinterested people after personal aggrandizement who deviate others from the actual path the lord is definitely the supreme person and his activities are transcendental one who understands this is a liberated person from the very beginning of his study of the gt thus end the bhaktivedanta purports to the fourth chapter of the rmadbhagavadgt in the matter of transcendental knowledge bg5 chapter five karmayoga action in ka consciousness text 1 arjuna uvca sannysa karma ka punar yoga ca asasi yac chreya etayor eka tan me brhi sunicitam arjuna

me brhiplease tell sunicitamdefinitely translation arjuna said o ka first of all you ask me to renounce work and then again you recommend work with devotion now will you kindly tell me definitely which of the two is more beneficial purport in this fifth chapter of the bhagavadgt the lord says that work in devotional service is better than dry mental speculation devotional service is easier than the latter because being transcendental in nature it frees one from reaction in the second chapter preliminary knowledge of the soul and its entanglement in the material body were explained how to get out of this material encagement by buddhiyoga or devotional service was also explained therein in the third chapter it was explained that a person who is situated on the platform of knowledge no longer has any duties to perform and in the fourth chapter the lord told arjuna that all kinds of sacrificial work culminate in knowledge however at the end of the fourth chapter the lord advised arjuna to wake up and fight being situated in perfect knowledge therefore by simultaneously stressing the importance of both work in devotion and inaction in knowledge ka has perplexed arjuna and confused his determination arjuna understands that renunciation in knowledge involves cessation of all kinds of work performed as sense activities but if one performs work in devotional service then how is work stopped in other words he thinks that sannysam or renunciation in knowledge should be altogether free from all kinds of activity because work and renunciation appear to him to be incompatible he appears not to have understood that work in full knowledge is nonreactive and is therefore the same as inaction he inquires therefore whether he should cease work altogether or work with full knowledge text 2 rbhagavn uvca sannysa karmayoga ca nireyasakarv ubhau tayos tu karmasannyst karmayogo viiyate r bhagavn uvcathe personality of godhead said sannysa renunciation of work

devotion viiyateis better translation the blessed lord said the renunciation of work and work in devotion are both good for liberation but of the two work in devotional service is better than renunciation of works purport fruitive activities seeking sense gratification are cause for material bondage as long as one is engaged in activities aimed at improving the standard of bodily comfort one is sure to transmigrate to different types of bodies thereby continuing material bondage perpetually rmadbhgavatam confirms this as follows nna pramatta kurute vikarma yadindriyaprtaya poti na sdhu manye yata tmano yam asann api kleada sa deha parbhavas tvad abodhajto yvanna jijsata tmatattvam yvat kriys tvad ida mano vai karmtmaka yena arrabandha eva mana karma vaa prayukte avidyaytmany upadhyamne prtir na yvan mayi vsudeve na mucyate dehayogena tvat people are mad after sense gratification and they do not know that this present body which is full of miseries is a result of ones fruitive activities in the past although this body is temporary it is always giving one trouble in many ways therefore to act for sense gratification is not good one is considered to be a failure in life as long as he makes no inquiry about the nature of work for fruitive results for as long as one is engrossed in the consciousness of sense gratification one has to transmigrate from one body to another although the mind may be engrossed in fruitive activities and influenced by ignorance one must develop a love for devotional service to vsudeva only then can one have the opportunity to get out of the bondage of material existence bhg 5546 therefore jna or knowledge that one is not this material body but spirit soul is not sufficient for liberation one has to act in the status of spirit soul otherwise there is no escape from material bondage action in ka consciousness is not however action on the fruitive platform activities performed in full knowledge strengthen ones advancement in real knowledge without ka consciousness mere renunciation of fruitive activities does not actually purify the heart of a conditioned soul as long as the heart is not purified one has to work on the fruitive platform but action in ka consciousness automatically helps one escape the result of fruitive action so that one need not descend to the material platform therefore action in ka consciousness is always superior to renunciation which always entails a risk of falling renunciation without ka consciousness is incomplete as is confirmed by rla rpa gosvm in his bhaktirasmtasindhu prpacikatay buddhy harisambandhivastuna mumukubhi paritygo vairgya phalgu kathyate renunciation by persons eager to achieve liberation of things which are related to the supreme personality of godhead though they are material is called incomplete renunciation renunciation is compete when it is in the knowledge that everything in existence belongs to the lord and that no one should claim proprietorship over anything one should understand that factually nothing belongs to anyone then where is the question of renunciation one who knows that everything is kas property is always situated in renunciation since everything belongs to ka everything should be employed in the service of ka this perfect form of action in ka consciousness is far better than any amount of artificial renunciation by a sannys of the myvd school text 3 jeya sa nityasannys yo na dvei na kkati nirdvandvo hi mahbho sukha bandht pramucyate jeyashould be known sahe nityaalways sannys renouncer yawho nanever dveiabhors nanor

fruits of his activities is known to be always renounced such a person liberated from all dualities easily overcomes material bondage and is completely liberated o mightyarmed arjuna purport one who is fully in ka consciousness is always a renouncer because he feels neither hatred nor desire for the results of his actions such a renouncer dedicated to the transcendental loving service of the lord is fully qualified in knowledge because he knows his constitutional position in his relationship with ka he knows fully well that ka is the whole and that he is part and parcel of ka such knowledge is perfect because it is qualitatively and quantitatively correct the concept of oneness with ka is incorrect because the part cannot be equal to the whole knowledge that one is one in quality yet different in quantity is correct transcendental knowledge leading one to become full in himself having nothing to aspire to nor lament over there is no duality in his mind because whatever he does he does for ka being thus freed from the platform of dualities he is liberatedeven in this material world text 4 skhyayogau pthag bl pravadanti na pait ekam apy sthita samyag ubhayor vindate phalam

skhya those who are actually learned say that he who applies himself well to one of these paths achieves the results of both purport the aim of the analytical study of the material world is to find the soul of existence the soul of the material world is viu or the supersoul devotional service to the lord entails service to the supersoul one process is to find the root of the tree and next to water the root the real student of skhya philosophy finds the root of the material world viu and then in perfect knowledge engages himself in the service of the lord therefore in essence there is no difference between the two because the aim of both is viu those who do not know the ultimate end say that the purposes of skhya and karmayoga are not the same but one who is learned knows the unifying aim in these different processes text 5 yat skhyai prpyate sthna tad yogair api gamyate eka skhya ca yoga ca ya payati sa payati yatwhat skhyaiby means of skhya philosophy prpyateis achieved

renunciation are one sees things as they are purport the real purpose of philosophical research is to find the ultimate goal of life since the ultimate goal of life is selfrealization there is no difference between the conclusions reached by the two processes by skhya philosophical research one comes to the conclusion that a living entity is not a part and parcel of the material world but of the supreme spirit whole consequently the spirit soul has nothing to do with the material world his actions must be in some relation with the supreme when he acts in ka consciousness he is actually in his constitutional position in the first process of skhya one has to become detached from matter and in the devotional yoga process one has to attach himself to the work of ka factually both processes are the same although superficially one process appears to involve detachment and the other process appears to involve attachment however detachment from matter and attachment to ka are one and the same one who can see this sees things as they are text 6 sannysas tu mahbho dukham ptum ayogata yogayukto munir brahma na ciredhigacchati sannysathe renounced order of life tubut mahbhoo mightyarmed

unless one is engaged in the devotional service of the lord mere renunciation of activities cannot make one happy the sages purified by works of devotion achieve the supreme without delay purport there are two classes of sannyss or persons in the renounced order of life the myvd sannyss are engaged in the study of skhya philosophy whereas the vaisnava sannyss are engaged in the study of bhgavatam philosophy which affords the proper commentary on the vedntastras the myvd sannyss also study the vedntastras but use their own commentary called rrakabhya written by akarcrya the students of the bhgavata school are engaged in devotional service of the lord according to pcartrik regulations and therefore the vaiava sannyss have multiple engagements in the transcendental service of the lord the vaiava sannyss have nothing to do with material activities and yet they perform various activities in their devotional service to the lord but the myvd sannyss engaged in the studies of skhya and vednta and speculation cannot relish transcendental service of the lord because their studies become very tedious they sometimes become tired of brahman speculation and thus they take shelter of the bhgavatam without proper understanding consequently their study of the rmadbhgavatam becomes troublesome dry speculations and impersonal interpretations by artificial means are all useless for the myvd sannyss the vaiava sannyss who are engaged in devotional service are happy in the discharge of their transcendental duties and they have the guarantee of ultimate entrance into the kingdom of god the myvd sannyss sometimes fall down from the path of selfrealization and again enter into material activities of a philanthropic and altruistic nature which are nothing but material engagements therefore the conclusion is that those who are engaged in ka consciousness are better situated than the sannyss engaged in simple brahman speculation although they too come to ka consciousness after many births text 7 yogayukto viuddhtm vijittm jitendriya sarvabhttmabhttm kurvann api na lipyate yogayuktaengaged in devotional service viuddhatma purified soul vijitatmselfcontrolled

is a pure soul and who controls his mind and senses is dear to everyone and everyone is dear to him though always working such a man is never entangled purport one who is on the path of liberation by ka consciousness is very dear to every living being and every living being is dear to him this is due to his ka consciousness such a person cannot think of any living being as separate from ka just as the leaves and branches of a tree are not separate from the tree he knows very well that by pouring water on the root of the tree the water will be distributed to all the leaves and branches or by supplying food to the stomach the energy is automatically distributed throughout the body because one who works in ka consciousness is servant to all he is very dear to everyone and because everyone is satisfied by his work he is pure in consciousness because he is pure in consciousness his mind is completely controlled and because his mind is controlled his senses are also controlled because his mind is always fixed on ka there is no chance of his being deviated from ka nor is there a chance that he will engage his senses in matters other than the service of the lord he does not like to hear anything except topics relating to ka he does not like to eat anything which is not offered to ka and he does not wish to go anywhere if ka is not involved therefore his senses are controlled a man of controlled senses cannot be offensive to anyone one may ask why then was arjuna offensive in battle to others wasnt he in ka consciousness arjuna was only superficially offensive because as has already been explained in the second chapter all the assembled persons on the battlefield would continue to live individually as the soul cannot be slain so spiritually no one was killed on the battlefield of kuruketra only their dresses were changed by the order of ka who was personally present therefore arjuna while fighting on the battlefield of kuruketra was not really fighting at all he was simply carrying out the orders of ka in full ka consciousness such a person is never entangled in the reactions of work texts 89 naiva kicit karomti yukto manyeta tattvavit paya van spa jighrann

actually does nothing at all because while speaking evacuating receiving opening or closing his eyes he always knows that only the material senses are engaged with their objects and that he is aloof from them purport a person in ka consciousness is pure in his existence and consequently he has nothing to do with any work which depends upon five immediate and remote causes the doer the work the situation the endeavor and fortune this is because he is engaged in the loving transcendental service of ka although he appears to be acting with his body and senses he is always conscious of his actual position which is spiritual engagement in material consciousness the senses are engaged in sense gratification but in ka consciousness the senses are engaged in the satisfaction of kas senses therefore the ka conscious person is always free even though he appears to be engaged in things of the senses activities such as seeing hearing speaking evacuating etc are actions of the senses meant for work a ka consciousness person is never affected by the actions of the senses he cannot perform any act except in the service of the lord because he knows that he is the eternal servitor of the lord text 10 brahmay dhya karmi saga tyaktv karoti ya lipyate na sa ppena padmapatram ivmbhas brahmaithe supreme personality of godhead dhyaresigning unto karmiall works sagamattachment tyaktvgiving

unto the supreme god is not affected by sinful action as the lotus leaf is untouched by water purport here brahmai means in ka consciousness the material world is a sum total manifestation of the three modes of material nature technically called the pradhna the vedic hymns sarvam etad brahma tasmd etad brahma nmarpam anna ca jyate and in the bhagavadgt mama yonir mahad brahma indicate that everything in the material world is the manifestation of brahman and although the effects are differently manifested they are nondifferent from the cause in the opaniad it is said that everything is related to the supreme brahman or ka and thus everything belongs to him only one who knows perfectly well that everything belongs to ka that he is the proprietor of everything and that therefore everything is engaged in the service of the lord naturally has nothing to do with the results of his activities whether virtuous or sinful even ones material body being a gift of the lord for carrying out a particular type of action can be engaged in ka consciousness it is beyond contamination by sinful reactions exactly as the lotus leaf though remaining in the water is not wet the lord also says in the gt mayi sarvi karmi sannyasya resign all works unto me ka the conclusion is that a person without ka consciousness acts according to the concept of the material body and senses but a person in ka consciousness acts according to the knowledge that the body is the property of ka and should therefore be engaged in the service of ka text 11 kyena manas buddhy kevalair indriyair api yogina karma

consciousness or in other words in the service of ka with his body mind intelligence and words is a liberated person even within the material world although he may be engaged in many socalled material activities he has no false ego nor does he believe that he is this material body nor that he possesses the body he knows that he is not this body and that this body does not belong to him he himself belongs to ka and the body too belongs to ka when he applies everything produced of the body mind intelligence words life wealth etcwhatever he may have within his possessionto kas service he is at once dovetailed with ka he is one with ka and is devoid of the false ego that leads one to believe that he is the body etc this is the perfect stage of ka consciousness text 12 yukta karmaphala tyaktv

attains unadulterated peace because he offers the result of all activities to me whereas a person who is not in union with the divine who is greedy for the fruits of his labor becomes entangled purport the difference between a person in ka consciousness and a person in bodily consciousness is that the former is attached to ka whereas the latter is attached to the results of his activities the person who is attached to ka and works for him only is certainly a liberated person and he is not anxious for fruitive rewards in the bhgavatam the cause of anxiety over the result of an activity is explained as being due to ones functioning in the conception of duality that is without knowledge of the absolute truth ka is the supreme absolute truth the personality of godhead in ka consciousness there is no duality all that exists is a product of kas energy and ka is all good therefore activities in ka consciousness are on the absolute plane they are transcendental and have no material effect one is therefore filled with peace in ka consciousness one who is however entangled in profit calculation for sense gratification cannot have that peace this is the secret of ka consciousness realization that there is no existence besides ka is the platform of peace and fearlessness text 13 sarvakarmi manas sannyasyste sukha va navadvre pure deh naiva kurvan na krayan

the city of nine gates the material body neither working nor causing work to be done purport the embodied soul lives in the city of nine gates the activities of the body or the figurative city of body are conducted automatically by the particular modes of nature the soul although subjecting himself to the conditions of the body can be beyond those conditions if he so desires owing only to forgetfulness of his superior nature he identifies with the material body and therefore suffers by ka consciousness he can revive his real position and thus come out of his embodiment therefore when one takes to ka consciousness one at once becomes completely aloof from bodily activities in such a controlled life in which his deliberations are changed he lives happily within the city of nine gates the nine gates are described as follows navadvre pure deh haso lelyate bahi va sarvasya lokasya sthvarasya carasya ca the supreme personality of godhead who is living within the body of a living entity is the controller of all living entities all over the universe the body consists of nine gates two eyes two nostrils two ears one mouth the anus and the genital the living entity in his conditioned stage identifies himself with the body but when he identifies himself with the lord within himself he becomes just as free as the lord even while in the body vet 318 therefore a ka conscious person is free from both the outer and inner activities of the material body text 14 na karttva na karmi lokasya sjati prabhu na karmaphalasayoga svabhvas tu pravartate nanever

material nature tubut pravartate acts translation the embodied spirit master of the city of his body does not create activities nor does he induce people to act nor does he create the fruits of action all this is enacted by the modes of material nature purport the living entity as will be explained in the seventh chapter is one in nature with the supreme lord distinguished from matter which is another naturecalled inferiorof the lord somehow the superior nature the living entity has been in contact with material nature since time immemorial the temporary body or material dwelling place which he obtains is the cause of varieties of activities and their resultant reactions living in such a conditional atmosphere one suffers the results of the activities of the body by identifying himself in ignorance with the body it is ignorance acquired from time immemorial that is the cause of bodily suffering and distress as soon as the living entity becomes aloof from the activities of the body he becomes free from the reactions as well as long as he is in the city of body he appears to be the master of it but actually he is neither its proprietor nor controller of its actions and reactions he is simply in the midst of the material ocean struggling for existence the waves of the ocean are tossing him and he has no control over them his best solution is to get out of the water by transcendental ka consciousness that alone will save him from all turmoil text 15 ndatte kasyacit ppa na caiva sukta vibhu ajnenvta jna tena muhyanti jantava nanever datteaccepts kasyacitanyones

does the supreme spirit assume anyones sinful or pious activities embodied beings however are bewildered because of the ignorance which covers their real knowledge purport the sanskrit word vibhu means the supreme lord who is full of unlimited knowledge riches strength fame beauty and renunciation he is always satisfied in himself undisturbed by sinful or pious activities he does not create a particular situation for any living entity but the living entity bewildered by ignorance desires to be put into certain conditions of life and thereby his chain of action and reaction begins a living entity is by superior nature full of knowledge nevertheless he is prone to be influenced by ignorance due to his limited power the lord is omnipotent but the living entity is not the lord is vibhu or omniscient but the living entity is au or atomic because he is a living soul he has the capacity to desire by his free will such desire is fulfilled only by the omnipotent lord and so when the living entity is bewildered in his desires the lord allows him to fulfill those desires but the lord is never responsible for the actions and reactions of the particular situation which may be desired being in a bewildered condition therefore the embodied soul identifies himself with the circumstantial material body and becomes subjected to the temporary misery and happiness of life the lord is the constant companion of the living entity as paramtm or the supersoul and therefore he can understand the desires of the individual soul as one can smell the flavor of a flower by being near it desire is a subtle form of conditioning of the living entity the lord fulfills his desire as he deserves man proposes and god disposes the individual is not therefore omnipotent in fulfilling his desires the lord however can fulfill all desires and the lord being neutral to everyone does not interfere with the desires of the minute independant living entities however when one desires ka the lord takes special care and encourages one to desire in such a way that one can attain to him and be eternally happy the vedic hymn therefore declares ea u hy eva sdhu karma krayati ta yamebhyo lokebhya unninate ea u evsdhu karma krayati yamadho ninate ajo jantur ano yam tmana sukhadukhayo varaprerito gacchet svarga vvabhram eva ca the lord engages the living entity in pious activities so he may be elevated the lord engages him in impious activities so he may go to hell the living entity is completely dependant in his distress and happiness by the will of the supreme he can go to heaven or hell as a cloud is driven by the air therefore the embodied soul by his immemorial desire to avoid ka consciousness causes his own bewilderment consequently although he is constitutionally eternal blissful and cognizant due to the littleness of his existence he forgets his constitutional position of service to the lord and is thus entrapped by nescience and under the spell of ignorance the living entity claims that the lord is responsible for his conditional existence the vedntastras also confirm this vaiamyanairghye na spekatvt tath hi darayati the lord neither hates nor likes anyone though he appears to text 16 jnena tu tad ajna ye nitam tmana tem dityavaj jna prakayati tat param jnenaby knowledge tubut tatthat ajnamnescience yem of those nitamis destroyed tmanaof the living entity temof their dityavatlike the rising sun jnamknowledge prakayati discloses tat paramin ka consciousness translation when however one is enlightened with the knowledge by which nescience is destroyed then his knowledge reveals everything as the sun lights up everything in the daytime purport those who have forgotten ka must certainly be bewildered but those who are in ka consciousness are not bewildered at all it is stated in the bhagavadgt sarva jnaplavena jngni sarva karmi and na hi jnena sadam knowledge is always highly esteemed and what is that knowledge perfect knowledge is achieved when one surrenders unto ka as is said in the seventh chapter 19th verse bahn janmanm ante jnavn m prapadyate after passing through many many births when one perfect in knowledge surrenders unto ka or when one attains ka consciousness then everything is revealed to him as the sun reveals everything in the daytime the living entity is bewildered in so many ways for instance when he thinks himself god unceremoniously he actually falls into the last snare of nescience if a living entity is god then how can he become bewildered by nescience does god become bewildered by nescience if so then nescience or satan is greater than god real knowledge can be obtained from a person who is in perfect ka consciousness therefore one has to seek out such a bona fide spiritual master and under him learn what ka consciousness is the spiritual master can drive away all nescience as the sun drives away darkness even though a person may be in full knowledge that he is not this body but is transcendental to the body he still may not be able to discriminate between the soul and the supersoul however he can know everything well if he cares to take shelter of the perfect bona fide ka conscious spiritual master one can know god and ones relationship with god only when one actually meets a representative of god a representative of god never claims that he is god although he is paid all the respect ordinarily paid to god because he has knowledge of god one has to learn the distinction between god and the living entity lord r ka therefore stated in the second chapter 212 that every living being is individual and that the lord also is individual they were all individuals in the past they are individuals at present and they will continue to be individuals in the future even after liberation at night we see everything as one in the darkness but in day when the sun is up we see everything in its real identity identity with individuality in spiritual life is real knowledge text 17 tadbuddhayas

refuge are all fixed in the supreme then one becomes fully cleansed of misgivings through complete knowledge and thus proceeds straight on the path of liberation purport the supreme transcendental truth is lord ka the whole bhagavad gt centers around the declaration of ka as the supreme personality of godhead that is the version of all vedic literature paratattva means the supreme reality who is understood by the knowers of the supreme as brahman paramtm and bhagavn bhagavn or the supreme personality of godhead is the last word in the absolute there is nothing more than thatthe lord says matta paratara nnyat kicit asti dhanajaya impersonal brahman is also supported by ka brahmao pratihham therefore in all ways ka is the supreme reality one whose mind intelligence faith and refuge are always in ka or in other words one who is fully in ka consciousness is undoubtedly washed clean of all misgivings and is in perfect knowledge in everything concerning transcendence a ka conscious person can thoroughly understand that there is duality simultaneous identity and individuality in ka and equipped with such transcendental knowledge one can make steady progress on the path of liberation text 18 vidyvinayasampanne brhmae gavi hastini uni caiva vapke ca pait samadarina vidyeducation vinayagentleness sampannefully equipped brhmaein the brhmaa gaviin the cow hastiniin the

knowledge sees with equal vision a learned and gentle brhmaa a cow an elephant a dog and a dogeater outcaste purport a ka conscious person does not make any distinction between species or castes the brhmaa and the outcaste may be different from the social point of view or a dog a cow or an elephant may be different from the point of view of species but these differences of body are meaningless from the viewpoint of a learned transcendentalist this is due to their relationship to the supreme for the supreme lord by his plenary portion as paramtm is present in everyones heart such an understanding of the supreme is real knowledge as far as the bodies are concerned in different castes or different species of life the lord is equally kind to everyone because he treats every living being as a friend yet maintains himself as paramtm regardless of the circumstances of the living entities the lord as paramtm is present both in the outcaste and in the brhmaa although the body of a brhmaa and that of an outcaste are not the same the bodies are material productions of different modes of material nature but the soul and the supersoul within the body are of the same spiritual quality the similarity in the quality of the soul and the supersoul however does not make them equal in quantity for the individual soul is present only in that particular body whereas the paramtm is present in each and every body a ka conscious person has full knowledge of this and therefore he is truly learned and has equal vision the similar characteristics of the soul and supersoul are that they are both conscious eternal and blissful but the difference is that the individual soul is conscious within the limited jurisdiction of the body whereas the supersoul is conscious of all bodies the supersoul is present in all bodies without distinction text 19 ihaiva tair jita sargo ye smye sthita mana nirdoa hi sama brahma tasmd brahmai te sthit ihain this life evacertainly taiby them

are already situated in brahman purport equanimity of mind as mentioned above is the sign of selfrealization those who have actually attained to such a stage should be considered to have conquered material conditions specifically birth and death as long as one identifies with this body he is considered a conditioned soul but as soon as he is elevated to the stage of equanimity through realization of self he is liberated from conditional life in other words he is no longer subject to take birth in the material world but can enter into the spiritual sky after his death the lord is flawless because he is without attraction or hatred similarly when a living entity is without attraction or hatred he also becomes flawless and eligible to enter into the spiritual sky such persons are to be considered already liberated and their symptoms are described below text 20 na prahyet priya prpya nodvijet prpya cpriyam sthirabuddhir asammho brahmavid brahmai sthita nanever

unbewildered and who knows the science of god is to be understood as already situated in transcendence purport the symptoms of the selfrealized person are given herein the first symptom is that he is not illusioned by the false identification of the body with his true self he knows perfectly well that he is not this body but is the fragmental portion of the supreme personality of godhead he is therefore not joyful in achieving something nor does he lament in losing anything which is related to his body this steadiness of mind is called sthirabuddhi or self intelligence he is therefore never bewildered by mistaking the gross body for the soul nor does he accept the body as permanent and disregard the existence of the soul this knowledge elevates him to the station of knowing the complete science of the absolute truth namely brahman paramtm and bhagavn he thus knows his constitutional position perfectly well without falsely trying to become one with the supreme in all respects this is called brahman realization or self realization such steady consciousness is called ka consciousness text 21 bhyasparev asakttm vindaty tmani yat sukham sa brahmayogayukttm sukham akayam anute

because the body itself is temporary a liberated soul is not interested in anything which is temporary knowing well the joys of transcendental pleasures how can a liberated soul agree to enjoy false pleasure in the padma pura it is said ramante yogino nante satynandacidtmani iti rmapadensau para brahmbhidhyate the mystics derive unlimited transcendental pleasures from the absolute truth and therefore the supreme absolute truth the personality of godhead is also known as rma in the rmadbhgavatam also it is said nya deho dehabhj nloke kan kmnarhate vibhuj ye tapo divya putrak yena sattva

rather you should undergo penances in this life by which your existence will be purified and as a result you will be able to enjoy unlimited transcendental bliss bhg 551 therefore those who are true yogs or learned transcendentalists are not attracted by sense pleasures which are the causes of continuous material existence the more one is addicted to material pleasures the more he is entrapped by material miseries text 23 aknothaiva ya sohu prk arravimokat kmakrodhodbhava vega sa yukta sa sukh nara aknotiable to do iha evain the present body yaone who sohumto tolerate prkbefore arrabody

urges of the material senses and check the force of desire and anger he is a yog and is happy in this world purport if one wants to make steady progress on the path of selfrealization he must try to control the forces of the material senses there are the forces of talk forces of anger forces of mind forces of the stomach forces of the genitals and forces of the tongue one who is able to control the forces of all these different senses and the mind is called gosvm or svm such gosvms live strictly controlled lives and forego altogether the forces of the senses material desires when unsatiated generate anger and thus the mind eyes and chest become agitated therefore one must practice to control them before one gives up this material body one who can do this is understood to be selfrealized and is thus happy in the state of selfrealization it is the duty of the transcendentalist to try strenuously to control desire and anger text 24 yo ntasukho ntarrmas tathntarjyotir eva ya sa yog

superficial happiness a liberated person enjoys happiness by factual experience he can therefore sit silently at any place and enjoy the activities of life from within such a liberated person no

entities when a person is actually in the knowledge that ka is the fountainhead of everything then when he acts in that spirit he acts for everyone the sufferings of humanity are due to forgetfulness of ka as the supreme enjoyer the supreme proprietor and the supreme friend therefore to act to revive this consciousness within the entire human society is the highest welfare work one cannot be engaged in firstclass welfare work without being liberated in the supreme a ka conscious person has no doubt about the supremacy of ka he has no doubt because he is completely freed from all sins this is the state of divine love a person engaged only in ministering to the physical welfare of human society cannot factually help anyone temporary relief of the external body and the mind is not satisfactory the real cause of ones difficulties in the hard struggle for life may be found in ones forgetfulness of his relationship with the supreme lord when a man is fully conscious of his relationship with ka he is actually a liberated soul although he may be in the material tabernacle text 26 kmakrodhavimuktn yatn yatacetasm abhito brahmanirva vartate vidittmanm kmadesires krodhaanger

so deeprooted that it is very difficult even for the great sages to control such desires despite great endeavors a devotee of the lord constantly engaged in devotional service in ka consciousness

liberated purport being engaged in ka consciousness one can immediately understand ones spiritual identity and then one can understand the supreme lord by means of devotional service when he is well situated in devotional service one comes to the transcendental position qualified to feel the presence of the lord in the sphere of ones activity this particular position is called liberation in the supreme after explaining the above principles of liberation in the supreme the lord gives instruction to arjuna as to how one can come to that position by the practice of mysticism or yoga known as agayoga which is divisible into an eightfold procedure called yama niyama sana pryma pratyhra dhra dhyna and samdhi in the sixth chapter the subject of yoga is explicitly detailed and at the end of the fifth it is only preliminarily explained one has to drive out the sense objects such as sound touch form taste and smell by the pratyhra breathing process in yoga and then keep the vision of the eyes between the two eyebrows and concentrate on the tip of the nose with half closed lids there is no benefit in closing the eyes altogether because then there is every chance of falling asleep nor is there benefit in opening the eyes completely because then there is the hazard of being attracted by sense objects the breathing movement is restrained within the nostrils by neutralizing the upand downmoving air within the body by practice of such yoga one is able to gain control over the senses refrain from outward sense objects and thus prepare oneself for liberation in the supreme this yoga process helps one become free from all kinds of fear and anger and thus feel the presence of the supersoul in the transcendental situation in other words ka consciousness is the easiest process of executing yoga principles this will be thoroughly explained in the next chapter a ka conscious person however being always engaged in devotional service does not risk losing his senses to some other engagement this is a better way of controlling the senses than by the agayoga text 29 bhoktra yajatapas sarvalokamahevaram suhda sarvabhtn jtv m ntim cchati bhoktrambeneficiary yajasacrifices tapasmof

of all living entities attain peace from the pangs of material miseries purport the conditioned souls within the clutches of illusory energy are all anxious to attain peace in the material world but they do not know the formula for peace which is explained in this part of the bhagavadgt the greatest peace formula is simply this lord ka is the beneficiary in all human activities men should offer everything to the transcendental service of the lord because he is the proprietor of all planets and the demigods thereon no one is greater than he he is greater than the greatest of the demigods lord iva and lord brahm in the vedas the supreme lord is described as tam var paramam mahevaram under the spell of illusion living entities are trying to be lords of all they survey but actually they are dominated by the material energy of the lord the lord is the master of material nature and the conditioned souls are under the stringent rules of material nature unless one understands these bare facts it is not possible to achieve peace in the world either individually or collectively this is the sense of ka consciousness lord ka is the supreme predominator and all living entities including the great demigods are his subordinates one can attain perfect peace only in complete ka consciousness this fifth chapter is a practical explanation of ka consciousness generally known as karmayoga the question of mental speculation as to how karmayoga can give liberation is answered herewith to work in ka consciousness is to work with the complete knowledge of the lord as the predominator such work is not different from transcendental knowledge direct ka consciousness is bhaktiyoga and jnayoga is a path leading to bhaktiyoga ka consciousness means to work in full knowledge of ones relationship with the supreme absolute and the perfection of this consciousness is full knowledge of ka or the supreme personality of godhead a pure soul is the eternal servant of god as his fragmental part and parcel he comes into contact with my illusion due to the desire to lord it over my and that is the cause of his many sufferings as long as he is in contact with matter he has to execute work in terms of material necessities ka consciousness however brings one into spiritual life even while one is within the jurisdiction of matter for it is an arousing of spiritual existence by practice in the material world the more one is advanced the more he is freed from the clutches of matter the lord is not partial toward anyone everything depends on ones practical performance of duties in an effort to control the senses and conquer the influence of desire and anger and attaining ka consciousness by controlling the abovementioned passions one remains factually in the transcendental stage or brahmannirva the eightfold yoga mysticism is automatically practiced in ka consciousness because the ultimate purpose is served there is gradual process of elevation in the practice of yama niyama sana pratyhra dhyna dhra pryma and samdhi but these only preface perfection by devotional service which alone can award peace to the human being it is the highest perfection of life thus end the bhaktivedanta purports to the fifth chapter of the rmadbhagavadgt in the matter of karmayoga or action in ka consciousness bg6 chapter six skhyayoga text 1 rbhagavn uvca anrita

his work and who works as he is obligated is in the renounced order of life and he is the true mystic not he who lights no fire and performs no work purport in this chapter the lord explains that the process of the eightfold yoga system is a means to control the mind and the senses however this is very difficult for people in general to perform especially in the age of kali although the eightfold yoga system is recommended in this chapter the lord emphasizes that the process of karmayoga or acting in ka consciousness is better everyone acts in this world to maintain his family and their paraphernalia but no one is working without some selfinterest some personal gratification be it concentrated or extended the criterion of perfection is to act in ka consciousness and not with a view to enjoying the fruits of work to act in ka consciousness is the duty of every living entity because all are constitutionally parts and parcels of the supreme the parts of the body work for the satisfaction of the whole body the limbs of the body do not act for selfsatisfaction but for the satisfaction of the complete whole similarly the living entity who acts for satisfaction of the supreme whole and not for personal satisfaction is the perfect sannys the perfect yog the sannyss sometimes artificially think that they have become liberated from all material duties and therefore they cease to perform agnihotra yajas fire sacrifices but actually they are selfinterested because their goal is becoming one with the impersonal brahman such a desire is greater than any material desire but it is not without selfinterest similarly the mystic yog who practices the yoga system with halfopen eyes ceasing all material activities desires some satisfaction for his personal self but a person acting in ka consciousness works for the satisfaction of the whole without selfinterest a ka conscious person has no desire for selfsatisfaction his criterion of success is the satisfaction of ka and thus he is the perfect sannys or perfect yog lord caitanya the highest perfectional symbol of renunciation prays in this way na dhana na jana na sundar kavit v jagada kmaye mama janmani janmanvare

kacanaanyone translation what is called renunciation is the same as yoga or linking oneself with the supreme for no one can become a yog unless he renounces the desire for sense gratification purport real sannysayoga or bhakti means that one should know his constitutional position as the living entity and act accordingly the living entity has no separate independant identity he is the marginal energy of the supreme when he is entrapped by material energy he is conditioned and when he is ka conscious or aware of the spiritual energy then he is in his real and natural state of life therefore when one is in complete knowledge one ceases all material sense gratification or renounces all kinds of sense gratificatory activities this is practiced by the yogs who restrain the senses from material attachment but a person in ka consciousness has no opportunity to engage his senses in anything which is not for the purpose of ka therefore a ka conscious person is simultaneously a sannys and a yog the purpose of knowledge and of restraining the senses as prescribed in the jna and yoga processes is automatically served in ka consciousness if one is unable to give up the activities of his selfish nature then jna and yoga are of no avail the real aim is for a living entity to give up all selfish satisfaction and to be prepared to satisfy the supreme a ka conscious person has no desire for any kind of self enjoyment he is always engaged for the enjoyment of the supreme one who has no information of the supreme must therefore be engaged in self satisfaction because no one can stand on the platform of inactivity all these purposes are perfectly served by the practice of ka consciousness text 3 rurukor muner yoga karma kraam ucyate yogrhasya tasyaiva ama kraam ucyate

amacessation of all material activities kraam the cause ucyateis said to be translation for one who is a neophyte in the eightfold yoga system work is said to be the means and for one who has already attained to yoga cessation of all material activities is said to be the means purport the process of linking oneself with the supreme is called yoga which may be compared to a ladder for attaining the topmost spiritual realization this ladder begins from the lowest material condition of the living entity and rises up to perfect selfrealization in pure spiritual life according to various elevations different parts of the ladder are known by different names but all in all the complete ladder is called yoga and may be divided into three parts namely jnayoga dhynayoga and bhaktiyoga the beginning of the ladder is called the yogruruka stage and the highest rung is called yogrha concerning the eightfold yoga system attempts in the beginning to enter into meditation through regulative principles of life and practice of different sitting postures which are more or less bodily exercises are considered fruitive material activities all such activities lead to achieving perfect mental equilibrium to control the senses when one is accomplished in the practice of meditation he ceases all disturbing mental activities a ka conscious person is however situated from the beginning on the platform of meditation because he always thinks of ka and being constantly engaged in the service of ka he is considered to have ceased all material activities text 4 yad hi nendriyrtheu na karmasv anuajjate

engaged in sense gratification or in fruitive activities otherwise one must be engaged in sense gratification since one cannot live without engagement without ka consciousness one must be always seeking selfcentered or extended selfish activities but a ka conscious person can do everything for the satisfaction of ka and thereby be perfectly detached from sense gratification one who has no such realization must mechanically try to escape material desires before being elevated to the top rung of the yoga ladder text 5 uddhared tmantmna ntmnam avasdayet tmaiva hy tmano bandhur tmaiva

and his enemy as well purport the word tm denotes body mind and souldepending upon different circumstances in the yoga system the mind and the conditioned soul are especially important since the mind is the central point of yoga practice tm refers here to the mind the purpose of the yoga system is to control the mind and to draw it away from attachment to sense objects it is stressed herein that the mind must be so trained that it can deliver the conditioned soul from the mire of nescience in material existence one is subjected to the influence of the mind and the senses in fact the pure soul is entangled in the material world because of the minds ego which desires to lord it over material nature therefore the mind should be trained so that it will not be attracted by the glitter of material nature and in this way the conditioned soul may be saved one should not degrade oneself by attraction to sense objects the more one is attracted by sense objects the more one becomes entangled in material existence the best way to disentangle oneself is to always engage the mind in ka consciousness the word hi isused for emphasizing this point ie that one must do this it is also said mana eva manuy kraa bandhamokayo bandhya viaysago muktyai nirviaya mana for man mind is the cause of bondage and mind is the cause of liberation mind absorbed in sense objects is the cause of bondage and mind detached from the sense objects is the cause of liberation therefore the mind which is always engaged in ka consciousness is the cause of supreme liberation text 6 bandhur tmtmanas

best of friends but for one who has failed to do so his very mind will be the greatest enemy purport the purpose of practicing eightfold yoga isto control the mind in order to make it a friend in discharging the human mission unless the mind is controlled the practice of yoga for show is simply a waste of time one who cannot control his mind lives always with the greatest enemy and thus his life and its mission are spoiled the constitutional position of the living entity is to carry out the order of the superior as long as ones mind remains an unconquered enemy one has to serve the dictations of lust anger avarice illusion etc but when the mind is conquered one voluntarily agrees to abide by the dictation of the personality of godhead who is situated within the heart of everyone as paramtm real yoga practice entails meeting the paramtm within the heart and then following his dictation for one who takes to ka consciousness directly perfect surrender to the dictation of the lord follows automatically text 7 jittmana prantasya paramtm samhita toasukhadukheu tath mnpamnayo jitatmanaof one who has conquered his mind prantasyaof one who has attained tranquility by such

the mind the supersoul is already reached for he has attained tranquility to such a man happiness and distress heat and cold honor and dishonor are all the same purport actually every living entity is intended to abide by the dictation of the supreme personality of godhead who is seated in everyones heart as paramtm when the mind is misled by the external illusory energy one becomes entangled in material activities therefore as soon as ones mind is controlled through one of the yoga systems one is to be considered as having already reached the destination one has to abide by superior dictation when ones mind is fixed on the superior nature he has no other alternative but to follow the dictation of the supreme the mind must admit some superior dictation and follow it the effect of controlling the mind is that one automatically follows the dictation of the paramtm or supersoul because this transcendental position is at once achieved by one who is in ka consciousness the devotee of the lord is unaffected by the dualities of material existence namely distress and happiness cold and heat etc this state is practical samdhi or absorption in the supreme text 8 jnavijnatpttm kastho

transcendental service to the lord are the transcendental name form quality and pastimes of the lord revealed to him padma pura this bhagavadgt is the science of ka consciousness no one can become ka conscious simply by mundane scholarship one must be fortunate enough to associate with a person who is in pure consciousness a ka conscious person has realized knowledge by the grace of ka because he is satisfied with pure devotional service by realized knowledge one becomes perfect by transcendental knowledge one can remain steady in his convictions but by mere academic knowledge one can be easily deluded and confused by apparent contradictions it is the realized soul who is actually selfcontrolled because he is surrendered to ka he is transcendental because he has nothing to do with

translation a transcendentalist should always try to concentrate his mind on the supreme self he should live alone in a secluded place and should always carefully control his mind he should be free from desires and feelings of possessiveness purport ka is realized in different degrees as brahman paramtm and the supreme personality of godhead ka consciousness means concisely to be always engaged in the transcendental loving service of the lord but those who are attached to the impersonal brahman or the localized supersoul are also partially ka conscious because impersonal brahman is the spiritual ray of ka and supersoul is the allpervading partial expansion of ka thus the impersonalist and the meditator are also indirectly ka conscious a directly ka conscious person is the topmost transcendentalist because such a devotee knows what is meant by brahman or paramtm his knowledge of the absolute truth is perfect whereas the impersonalist and the meditative yog are imperfectly ka conscious nevertheless all of these are instructed herewith to be constantly engaged in their particular pursuits so that they may come to the highest perfection sooner or later the first business of a transcendentalist is to keep the mind always on ka one should always think of ka and not forget him even for a moment concentration of the mind on the supreme is called samdhi or trance in order to concentrate the mind one should always remain in seclusion and avoid disturbance by external objects he should be very careful to accept favorable and reject unfavorable conditions that affect his realization and in perfect determination he should not hanker after unnecessary material things that entangle him by feelings of possessiveness all these perfections and precautions are perfectly executed when one is directly in ka consciousness because direct ka consciousness means selfabnegation wherein there is very little chance for material possessiveness rla rpa gosvm characterizes ka

everything without knowledge of its relationship to ka is not as complete in his renunciation a ka conscious person well knows that everything belongs to ka and thus he is always free from feelings of personal possession as such he has no hankering for anything on his own personal account he knows how to accept things in favor of ka consciousness and how to reject things unfavorable to ka consciousness he is always aloof from material things because he is always transcendental and he is always alone having nothing to do with persons not in ka consciousness therefore a person in ka consciousness is the perfect yog texts 1112 ucau dee pratihpya sthiram sanam tmana ntyucchrita ntinca cailjinakuottaram tatraikgra mana ktv yatacittendriyakriya upaviysane yujyd yogam tmaviuddhaye

fixing the mind on one point purport sacred place refers to places of pilgrimage in india the yogs the transcendentalists or the devotees all leave home and reside in sacred places such as prayg mathur vndvana hkea and hardwar and in solitude practice yoga where the sacred rivers like the yamun and the ganges flow but often this is not possible especially for westerners the socalled yoga societies in big cities may be successful in earning material benefit but they are not at all suitable for the actual practice of yoga one who is not selfcontrolled and whose mind is not undisturbed cannot practice meditation therefore in the bhannradya pura it is said that in the kaliyuga the present yuga or age when people in general are shortlived slow in spiritual realization and always disturbed by various anxieties the best means of spiritual realization is chanting the holy name of the lord harer nma harer nma harer nmaiva kevalam kalau nsty eva nsty eva nsty eva gatir anyath in

in a straight line and stare steadily at the tip of the nose thus with an unagitated subdued mind devoid of fear completely free from sex life one should meditate upon me within the heart and make me the ultimate goal of life purport the goal of life is to know ka who is situated within the heart of every living being as paramtm the fourhanded viu form the yoga process is practiced in order to discover and see this localized form of viu and not for any other purpose the localized viumrti is the plenary representation of ka dwelling within ones heart one who has no program to realize this viu murti is uselessly engaged in mockyoga practice and is certainly wasting his time k is the ultimate goal of life and the viumurti situated in ones heart is the object of yoga practice to realize this viumurti within the heart one has to observe complete abstinence from sex life therefore one has to leave home and live alone in a secluded place remaining seated as mentioned above one cannot enjoy sex life daily at home or elsewhere and attend a socalled yoga class and thus become a yog one has to practice controlling the mind and avoiding all kinds of sense gratification of which sex life is the chief in the rules of celibacy written by the great sage yjavalkya it is said karma manas vc sarvvasthsu sarvad sarvatra maithuatygo brahmacarya pracakate the vow of brahmacarya is meant to help one completely abstain from sex indulgence in work words and mindat all times under all circumstances and in all places no one can perform correct yoga practice through sex indulgence brahmacarya is taught therefore from childhood when one has no knowledge of sex life children at the age of five are sent to the gurukula or the place of the spiritual master and the master trains the young boys in the strict discipline of becoming brahmacrs without such practice no one can make advancement in any yoga whether it be dhyna jna or bhakti one who however follows the rules and regulations of married life having sexual relationship only with his wife and that also under regulation is also called brahmacr such a restrained householder brahmacr may be accepted in the bhakti school but the jna and dhyna schools do not admit even householder brahmacrs they require complete abstinence without compromise in the bhakti school a householder brahmacr is allowed controlled sex life because the cult of bhaktiyoga is so powerful that one automatically loses sexual attraction being engaged in the superior service of the lord in the bhagavadgt it is said viay vinivartante nirhrasya dehina rasavarja raso py asya para dv nivartate whereas others are forced to restrain themselves from sense gratification a devotee of the lord automatically refrains because of superior taste other than the devotee no one has any information of that superior taste vigatabh one cannot be fearless unless one is fully in ka consciousness a conditioned soul is fearful due to his perverted memory his forgetfulness of his eternal relationship with ka the bhgavatam says bhaya dvitybhiniveata syd d apetasya viparyayo smti ka consciousness is the only basis for fearlessness therefore perfect practice is possible for a person who is ka conscious and since the ultimate goal of yoga practice is to see the lord within a ka conscious person is already the best of all yogs the principles of the yoga system mentioned herein are different from those of the popular socalled yoga societies text 15 yujann eva sadtmna yog niyatamnasa nti nirvaparamm matsasthm adhigacchati

matsasthmin the spiritual sky the kingdom of god adhigacchatidoes attain translation thus practicing control of the body mind and activities the mystic transcendentalist attains to the kingdom of god or the abode of ka by cessation of material existence purport the ultimate goal in practicing yoga is now clearly explained yoga practice is not meant for attaining any kind of material facility it is to enable the cessation of all material existence one who seeks an improvement in health or aspires after material perfection is no yog according to bhagavadgt nor does cessation of material existence entail ones entering into the void which is only a myth there is no void anywhere within the creation of the lord rather the cessation of material existence enables one to enter into the spiritual sky the abode of the lord the abode of the lord is also clearly described in the bhagavadgt as that place where there is no need of sun moon nor electricity all the planets in the spiritual kingdom are selfilluminated like the sun in the material sky the kingdom of god is everywhere but the spiritual sky and the planets thereof are called para dhma or superior abodes a consummate yog who is perfect in understanding lord ka as is clearly stated herein matcitta matpara matsthnam by the lord himself can attain real peace and can ultimately reach his supreme abode the kaloka known as goloka vndvana in the brahmasahit it is clearly stated goloka eva nivasaty akhiltma bhta that the lord although residing always in his abode called goloka is the allpervading brahman and the localized paramtm as well by dint of his superior spiritual energies no one can reach the spiritual sky or enter into the eternal abode vaikuha goloka vndvana of the lord without the proper understanding of ka and his plenary expansion viu therefore a person working in ka consciousness is the perfect yog because his mind is always absorbed in kas activities sa vai mana kapadravindayo in the vedas also we learn tam eva viditvtimtyum eti one can overcome the path of birth and death only by understanding the supreme personality of godhead ka in other words perfection of the yoga system is the attainment of freedom

sleeps too much or does not sleep enough purport regulation of diet and sleep is recommended herein for the yogs too much eating means eating more than is required to keep the body and soul together there is no need for men to eat animals because there is an ample supply of grains vegetables fruits and milk such simple foodstuff is considered to be in the mode of goodness according to the bhagavad gt animal food is for those in the mode of ignorance therefore those who indulge in animal food drinking smoking and eating food which is not first offered to ka will suffer sinful reactions because of eating only polluted things bhujate te tv agha papa ye pacanty tmakrat anyone who eats for sense pleasure or cooks for himself not offering his food to ka eats only sin one who eats sin and eats more than is allotted to him cannot execute perfect yoga it is best that one eat only the remnants of foodstuff offered to ka a person in ka consciousness does not eat anything which is not first offered to ka therefore only the ka conscious person can attain perfection in yoga practice nor can one who artificially abstains from eating manufacturing his own personal process of fasting practice yoga the ka conscious person observes fasting as it is recommended in the scriptures he does not fast or eat more than is required and he is thus competent to perform yoga practice one who eats more than required will dream very much while sleeping and he must consequently sleep more than is required one should not sleep more than six hours daily one who sleeps more than six hours out of twentyfour is certainly influenced by the mode of ignorance a person in the mode of ignorance is lazy and prone to sleep a great deal such a person cannot perform yoga text 17 yukthravihrasya

advancement in the practice of yoga as far as eating is concerned it can be regulated only when one is practiced to take and accept prasdam sanctified food lord ka is offered according to the bhagavadgt bg 926 vegetables flowers fruits grains milk etc in this way a person in ka consciousness becomes automatically trained not to accept food not meant for human consumption or which is not in the category of goodness as far as sleeping is concerned a ka conscious person is always alert in the discharge of his duties in ka consciousness and therefore any unnecessary time spent sleeping is considered a great loss a ka conscious person cannot bear to pass a minute of his life without being engaged in the service of the lord therefore his sleeping is kept to a minimum his ideal in this respect is rla rpa gosvm who was always engaged in the service of ka and who could not sleep more than two hours a day and sometimes not even that hkura haridsa would not even accept prasdam nor even sleep for a moment without finishing his daily routine of chanting with his beads three hundred thousand names as far as work is concerned a ka conscious person does not do anything which is not connected with kas interest and thus his work is always regulated and is untainted by sense gratification since there is no question of sense gratification there is no material leisure for a person in ka consciousness and because he is regulated in all his work speech sleep wakefulness and all other bodily activities there is no material misery for him text 18 yad viniyata cittam tmany evvatihate

are quite befitting a pure devotee this transcendental stage may be inexpressible subjectively by the followers of the impersonalist path but it becomes very easy and practical for a person in ka consciousness as is apparent in the above description of the engagements of mahrja ambara unless the mind is fixed on the lotus feet of the lord by constant remembrance such transcendental engagements are not practical in the devotional service of the lord therefore these prescribed activities are called arcan or engaging all the senses in the service of the lord the senses and the mind require engagements simple abnegation is not practical therefore for people in generalespecially those who are not in the renounced order of life transcendental engagement of the senses and the mind as described above is the perfect process for transcendental achievement which is called yukta in the bhagavadgt text 19 yath dpo nivtastho negate sopam smt yogino yatacittasya yujato yogam tmana yathas

trance in yoga translation the stage of perfection is called trance or samdhi when ones mind is completely restrained from material mental activities by practice of yoga this is characterized by ones ability to see the self by the pure mind and to relish and rejoice in the self in that joyous state one is situated in boundless transcendental happiness and enjoys himself through transcendental senses established thus one never departs from the truth and upon gaining this he thinks there is no greater gain being situated in such a position one is never shaken even in the midst of greatest difficulty this indeed is actual freedom from all miseries arising from material contact purport by practice of yoga one becomes gradually detached from material concepts this is the primary characteristic of the yoga principle and after this one becomes situated in trance or samdhi which means that the yog realizes the supersoul through transcendental mind and intelligence without any of the misgivings of identifying the self with the superself yoga practice is more or less based on the principles of the patajali system some unauthorized commentators try to identify the individual soul with the supersoul and the monists think this to be liberation but they do not understand the real purpose of the patajali system of yoga there is an acceptance of transcendental pleasure in the patajali system but the monists do not accept this transcendental pleasure out of fear of jeopardizing the theory of oneness the duality of knowledge and knower is not accepted by the nondualist but in this verse transcendental pleasure realized through transcendental sensesis accepted and this is corroborated by the patajali muni the famous exponent of the yoga system the great sage declares in his yogastras pururthanyn gun pratiprasava kaivalya svarpapratih v citiaktir iti this citiakti or internal potency is transcendental pururtha means material religiosity economic development sense gratification and at the end the attempt to become one with the supreme this oneness with the supreme is called kaivalyam by the monist but according to patajali this kaivalyam is an internal or transcendental potency by which the living entity becomes aware of his constitutional position in the words of lord caitanya this state of affairs is called cetodarpaamrjanam or clearance of the impure mirror of the mind this clearance is actually liberation or bhavamahdvgninirvpaam the theory of nirvaalso preliminary corresponds with this principle in the bhgavatam this is called svarpea vyavasthiti the bhagavadgt also confirms this situation in this verse after nirva or material cessation there is the manifestation of spiritual activities or devotional service of the lord known as ka consciousness in the words of the bhgavatam svarpea vyavasthiti this is the real life of the living entity my or illusion is the condition of spiritual life contaminated by material infection liberation from this material infection does not mean destruction of the original eternal position of the living entity patajali also accepts this by his words kaivalyam svarpapratih v citiaktir iti this citiakti or transcendental pleasure is real life this is confirmed in the vedntastras as nandamayo bhyst this natural transcendental pleasure is the ultimate goal of yoga and is easily achieved by execution of devotional service or bhaktiyoga bhaktiyoga will be vividly described in the seventh chapter of bhagavadgt in the yoga system as described in this chapter there are two kinds of samdhi called samprajtasamdhi and asamprajtasamdhi when one becomes situated in the transcendental position by various philosophical researches it is called samprajtasamdhi in the asamprajtasamdhi there is no longer any connection with mundane pleasure for one is then transcendental to all sorts of happiness derived from the senses when the yog is once situated in that transcendental position he is never shaken from it unless the yog is able to reach this position he is unsuccessful todays socalled yoga practice which involves various sense pleasures is contradictory a yog indulging in sex and intoxication is a mockery even those yogs who are attracted by the siddhis perfections in the process of yoga are not perfectly situated if the yogs are attracted by the byproducts of yoga then they cannot attain the stage of perfection as is stated in this verse persons therefore indulging in the makeshow practice of gymnastic feats or siddhis should know that the aim of yoga is lost in that way the best practice of yoga in this age is ka consciousness which is not baffling a ka conscious person is so happy in his occupation that he does not aspire after any other happiness there are many impediments especially in this age of hypocrisy to practicing haha yoga dhynayoga and jnayoga but there is no such problem in executing karmayoga or bhaktiyoga as long as the material body exists one has to meet the demands of the body namely eating sleeping defending and mating but a person who is in pure bhaktiyoga or in ka consciousness does not arouse the senses while meeting the demands of the body rather he accepts the bare necessities of life making the best use of a bad bargain and enjoys transcendental happiness in ka consciousness he is callous toward incidental occurrencessuch as accidents disease scarcity and even the death of a most dear relativebut he is always alert to execute his duties in ka consciousness or bhaktiyoga accidents never deviate him from his duty as stated in the bhagavadgt gampyino nitys ts titikasva bhrata he endures all such incidental occurences because he knows that they come and go and do not affect his duties in this way he achieves the highest

prasidhyati the process of bhaktiyoga can be executed successfully with fullhearted enthusiasm perseverance and determination by following the prescribed duties in the association of devotees and by engaging completely in activities of goodness as for determination one should follow the example of the sparrow who lost her eggs in the waves of the ocean a sparrow laid her eggs on the shore of the ocean but the big ocean carried away the eggs on its waves the sparrow became very upset and asked the ocean to return her eggs the ocean did not even consider her appeal so the sparrow decided to dry up the ocean she began to pick out the water in her small beak and everyone laughed at her for her impossible determination the news of her activity spread and at last garua the gigantic bird carrier of lord viu heard it he became compassionate toward his small sister bird and so he came to see the sparrow garua was very pleased by the determination of the small sparrow and he promised to help thus garua at once asked the ocean to return her eggs lest he himself take up the work of the sparrow the ocean was frightened at this and returned the eggs thus the sparrow became happy by the grace of garua similarly the practice of yoga especially bhaktiyoga in ka consciousness may appear to be a very difficult job but if anyone follows the principles with great determination the lord will surely help for god helps those who help themselves text 25 anai anair uparamed buddhy dhtightay tmasastha mana ktv na kicid api cintayet anaigradually anaistep by step uparamethesitated buddhy by

at that time there is no longer any danger of becoming engaged in the material conception of life in other words although one is involved with matter as long as the material body exists one should not think about sense gratification one should think of no pleasure aside from the pleasure of the supreme self this state is easily attained by directly practicing ka consciousness text 26 yato yato

not control him one who controls the mind and therefore the senses as well is called gosvm or svm and one who is controlled by the mind is called godsa or the servant of the senses a gosvm knows the standard of sense happiness in transcendental sense happiness the senses are engaged in the service of hkea or the supreme owner of the senseska serving ka with purified senses is called ka

lord is eternally transcendental and is not materially affected by his presence in either a dog or a brhmaa that is the supreme neutrality of the lord the individual soul is also situated in the individual heart but he is not present in all hearts that is the distinction between the individual soul and the supersoul one who is not factually in the practice of yoga cannot see so clearly a ka conscious person can see ka in the heart of both the believer and nonbeliever in the smti this is confirmed as follows tatatvc ca mttvd tm hi paramo hari the lord being the source of all beings is like the mother and the maintainer as the mother is neutral to all different kinds of children the supreme father or mother is also consequently the supersoul is always in every living being outwardly also every living being is situated in the energy of the lord as will be explained in the seventh chapter the lord has primarily two energiesthe spiritual or superior and the material or inferior the living entity although part of the superior energy is conditioned by the inferior energy the living entity is always in the lords energy every living entity is situated in him in one way or another the yog sees equally because he sees that all living entities although in different situations according to the results of fruitive work in all circumstances remain the servants of god while in the material energy the living entity serves the material senses and while in spiritual energy he serves the supreme lord directly in either case the living entity is the servant of god this vision of

material nature but in each and every instance he is conscious of ka knowing that everything is the manifestation of kas energy nothing can exist without ka and ka is the lord of everythingthis is the basic principle of ka consciousness ka consciousness is the development of love of kaa position transcendental even to material liberation it is the stage beyond selfrealization at which the devotee becomes one with ka in the sense that ka becomes everything for the devotee and the devotee becomes full in loving ka an intimate relationship between the lord and the devotee then exists in that stage the living entity attains his immortality nor is the personality of godhead ever out of the sight of the devotee to merge in ka is spiritual annihilation a devotee takes no such risk it is stated in the brahmasahit premjanacchuritabhaktivilocanena santa sadaiva hdayeu vilokayanti ya ymasundaram acintyaguasvarpa govindam dipurua tam aha bhajmi i worship the primeval lord govinda who is

pure devotee and cannot bear to live for a moment without seeing the lord within himself text 31 sarvabhtasthita yo m bhajaty ekatvam sthita sarvath vartamno pi sa yog mayi vartate

viu is not different from ka ka in this form of supersoul is situated in everyones heart furthermore there is no difference between the innumerable supersouls present in the innumerable hearts of living entities nor is there a difference between a ka conscious person always engaged in the transcendental loving service of ka and a perfect yog engaged in meditation on the supersoul the yog in ka consciousness even though he may be engaged in various activities while in material existence remains always situated in ka this is confirmed in the bhaktirasmta sindhu of rla rpa gosvm nikhileu avasthsu jvanmukta sa ucyate a devotee of the lord always acting in ka consciousness is automatically liberated in the nradapacartra this is confirmed in this way dikkldyanavacchinne ke ceto vidhya ca

makes the yog faultless the vedas confirm this inconceivable potency of the lord as follows eko pi san bahudh yo vabhti aivaryd rpam eka ca sryavad bahudheyate viu is one and yet he is certainly

purport one who is ka conscious is a perfect yog he is aware of everyones happiness and distress by dint of his own personal experience the cause of the distress of a living entity is forgetfulness of his relationship with god and the cause of happiness is knowing ka to be the supreme enjoyer of all the activities of the human being ka is the proprietor of all lands and planets the perfect yog is the sincerest friend of all living entities he knows that the living being who is conditioned by the modes of material nature is subjected to the threefold material miseries due to forgetfulness of his relationship with ka because one in ka consciousness is happy he tries to distribute the knowledge of ka everywhere since the perfect yog tries to broadcast the importance of becoming ka conscious he is the best philanthropist in the world and he is the dearest servitor of the lord na tasmt kacid me priyakt tama in other words a devotee of the lord always looks to the welfare of all living entities and in this way he is factually the friend of everyone he is the best yog because he does not desire perfection in yoga for his personal benefit but tries for others also he does not envy his fellow living entities here is a contrast between a pure devotee of the lord and a yog interested only in his personal elevation the yog who has withdrawn to a secluded place in order to meditate perfectly may not be as perfect as a devotee who is trying his best to turn every man toward ka consciousness text 33 arjuna uvca yo ya yogas tvay prokta smyena madhusdana etasyha na paymi cacalatvt

is restless and unsteady purport the system of mysticism described by lord ka to arjuna beginning with the words ucau dee and ending with yog parama is here being rejected by arjuna out of a feeling of inability it is not possible for an ordinary man to leave home and go to a secluded place in the mountains or jungles to practice yoga in this age of kali the present age is characterized by a bitter struggle for a life of short duration people are not serious about selfrealization even by simple practical means and what to speak of this difficult yoga system which regulates the mode of living the manner of sitting selection of place and detachment of the mind from material engagements as a practical man arjuna thought it was impossible to follow this system of yoga even though he was favorably endowed in many ways he belonged to the royal family and was highly elevated in terms of numerous qualities he was a great warrior he had great longevity and above all he was the most intimate friend of lord ka the supreme personality of godhead five thousand years ago arjuna had much better facilities then we do now yet he refused to accept this system of yoga in fact we do not find any record in history of his practicing it at any time therefore this system must be considered generally impossible in this age of kali of course it may be possible for some very few rare men but for the people in general it is an impossible proposal if this were so five thousand years ago then what of the present day those who are imitating this yoga system in different socalled schools and societies although complacent are certainly wasting their time they are completely in ignorance of the desired goal text 34 cacala hi mana ka pramthi balavad dham tasyha nigraha manye vyor iva

for the mind is restless turbulent obstinate and very strong o ka and to subdue it is it seems to me more difficult than controlling the wind purport the mind is so strong and obstinate that it sometimes overcomes the intelligence although mind is supposed to be subservient to the intelligence for a man in the practical world who has to fight so many opposing elements it is certainly very difficult to control the mind artificially one may establish a mental equilibrium toward both friend and enemy but ultimately no worldly man can do so for this is more difficult than controlling the raging wind in the vedic literatures it is said tmna rathina viddhi arra ratham eva ca buddhintu srathi viddhi mana pragraham eva ca indriyi haynhur viays teu gocarn tmendriyamanoyukto bhoktety hur mania the individual is the passenger in the car of the material body and intelligence is the driver mind is the driving instrument and the senses are the horses the self is thus the enjoyer or sufferer in the association of the mind and senses so it is understood by great thinkers intelligence is supposed to direct the mind but the mind is so strong and obstinate that it often overcomes even ones own intelligence such a strong mind is supposed to be controlled by the practice of yoga but such practice is never practical for a worldly person like arjuna and what can we say of modern man the simile used here is appropriate one cannot capture the blowing wind and it is even more difficult to capture the turbulent mind the easiest way to control the mind as suggested by lord caitanya is chanting hare ka the great mantra for deliverance in all humility the method prescribed is sa vai mana kapadravindayo one must engage ones mind fully in ka only then will there remain no other engagements to agitate the mind text 35 r bhagavn uvca asaaya mahbho mano durnigraha calam abhysena tu kaunteya vairgyea ca ghyate r bhagavn uvcathe personality of godhead said asaayam

translation the blessed lord said o mightyarmed son of kunt it is undoubtedly very difficult to curb the restless mind but it is possible by constant practice and by detachment purport the difficulty of controlling the obstinate mind as expressed by arjuna is accepted by the personality of godhead but at the same time he suggests that by practice and detachment it is possible what is that practice in the present age no one can observe strict rules and regulations such as placing oneself in a sacred place focusing the mind on the supersoul restraining the senses and mind observing celibacy remaining alone etc by the practice of ka consciousness however one engages in nine types of devotional service to the lord the first and foremost of such devotional engagements is hearing about ka this is a very powerful transcendental method for purging the mind of all misgivings the more one hears about ka the more one becomes enlightened and detached from everything that draws the mind away from ka by detaching the mind from activities not devoted to the lord one can very easily learn vairgya vairgya means detachment from matter and engagement of the mind in spirit impersonal spiritual detachment is more difficult than attaching the mind to the activities of ka this is practical because by hearing about ka one becomes automatically attached to the supreme spirit this attachment is called parenubhti spiritual satisfaction it is just like the feeling of satisfaction a hungry man has for every morsel of food he eats similarly by discharge of devotional service one feels transcendental satisfaction as the mind becomes detached from material objectives it is something like curing a disease by expert treatment and appropriate diet hearing of the transcendental activities of lord ka is therefore expert treatment for the mad mind and eating the foodstuff offered to ka is the appropriate diet for the suffering patient this treatment is the process of ka consciousness text 36 asayattman yogo duprpa iti me mati vaytman tu yatat akyo vptum upyata asayataunbridled tmanby the mind yogaselfrealization duprpadifficult to obtain itithus memy matiopinion vaya

whose mind is controlled and who strives by right means is assured of success that is my opinion purport the supreme personality of godhead declares that one who does not accept the proper treatment to detach the mind from material engagement can hardly achieve success in selfrealization trying to practice yoga while engaging the mind in material enjoyment is like trying to ignite a fire while pouring water on it similarly yoga practice without mental control is a waste of time such a show of yoga practice may be materially lucrative but it is useless as far as spiritual realization is concerned therefore the mind must be controlled by engaging it constantly in the transcendental loving service of the lord unless one is engaged in ka consciousness he cannot steadily control the mind a ka conscious person easily achieves the result of yoga practice without separate endeavor but a yoga practitioner cannot achieve success without becoming ka conscious text 37 arjuna uvca ayati

of faith who does not persevere who in the beginning takes to the process of selfrealization but who later desists due to worldly mindedness and thus does not attain perfection in mysticism purport the path of selfrealization or mysticism is described in the bhagavadgt the basic principle of selfrealization is knowledge that the living entity is not this material body but that he is different from it and that his happiness is in eternal life bliss and knowledge these are transcendental beyond both body and mind self realization is sought by the path of knowledge the practice of the eightfold system or by bhaktiyoga in each of these processes one has to realize the constitutional position of the living entity his relationship with god and the activities whereby he can reestablish the lost link and achieve the highest perfectional stage of ka consciousness following any of the abovementioned three methods one is sure to reach the supreme goal sooner or later this was asserted by the lord in the second chapter even a little endeavor on the transcendental path offers a great hope for deliverance out of these three methods the path of bhaktiyoga is especially suitable for this age because it is the most direct method of god realization to be doubly assured arjuna is asking lord ka to confirm his former statement one may sincerely accept the path of selfrealization but the process of cultivation of knowledge and the practice of the eightfold yoga system are generally very difficult for this age therefore despite constant endeavor one may fail for many reasons first of all one may not be following the process to pursue the transcendental path is more or less to declare war on illusory energy consequently whenever a person tries to escape the clutches of the illusory energy she tries to defeat the practitioner by various allurements a conditioned soul is already allured by the modes of material energy and there is every chance of being allured again even while performing transcendental disciplines this is called yogt calitamnasa deviation from the transcendental path arjuna is inquisitive to know the results of deviation from the path of selfrealization text 38 kaccin nobhayavibhraa chinnbhram iva nayati apratiho mahbho vimho brahmaa pathi kaccitwhether nanot ubhayaboth vibhraadeviated from chinnafallen abhramcloud ivalikened

more interested in material advancement by economic development or in promotion to the higher planets by appropriate work when one takes to the path of transcendence one has to cease all material activities and sacrifice all forms of socalled material happiness if the aspiring transcendentalist fails then he apparently loses both ways in other words he can enjoy neither material happiness nor spiritual success he has no position he is like a riven cloud a cloud in the sky sometimes deviates from a small cloud and joins a big one but if it cannot join a big one then it is blown away by the wind and becomes a nonentity in the vast sky the brahmaa pathi is the path of transcendental realization through knowing oneself to be spiritual in essence part and parcel of the supreme lord who is manifested as brahman paramtm and bhagavn lord r ka is the fullest manifestation of the supreme absolute truth and therefore one who is surrendered to the supreme person is a successful transcendentalist to reach this goal of life through brahman and paramtm realization takes many many births bahn janmanm ante therefore the supermost of transcendental realization is bhaktiyoga or ka consciousness the direct method text 39 etan me saaya ka chettum arhasy aeata tvadanya saayasysya chett na hy upapadyate etatthis is memy saayamdoubt kao ka chettumto dispel arhasirequested to do

exist individually in the past that they exist now in the present and that they continue to retain individual identity in the future even after liberation from the material entanglement so he has already cleared up the question of the future of the individual living entity now arjuna wants to know of the future of the unsuccessful transcendentalist no one is equal to or above ka and certainly the socalled great sages and philosophers who are at the mercy of material nature cannot equal him therefore the verdict of ka is the final and complete answer to all doubts because he knows past present and future perfectlybut no one knows him ka and ka conscious devotees alone can know what is what text 40 r bhagavn uvca prtha naiveha nmutra vinas tasya vidyate na hi kalyakt kacid durgati

someone gives up all material prospects and takes complete shelter of the supreme personality of godhead there is no loss or degradation in any way on the other hand a nondevotee may fully engage in his occupational duties and yet not gain anything for material prospects there are many activities both scriptural and customary a transcendentalist is supposed to give up all material activities for the sake of spiritual advancement in life ka consciousness one may argue that by ka consciousness one may attain the highest perfection if it is completed but if one does not attainsuch a perfectional stage then he loses both materially and spiritually it is enjoined in the scriptures that one has to suffer the reaction of not executing prescribed duties therefore one who fails to discharge transcendental activities properly becomes subjected to these reactions the bhgavatam assures the unsuccessful transcendentalist that there need be no worries even though he may be subjected to the reaction of not perfectly executing prescribed duties he is still not a loser because auspicious ka consciousness is never forgotten and one so engaged will continue to be so even if he is lowborn in the next life on the other hand one who simply follows strictly the prescribed duties need not necessarily attain auspicious results if he is lacking in ka consciousness the purport may be understood as follows humanity may be divided into two sections namely the regulated and the nonregulated those who are engaged simply in bestial sense gratifications without knowledge of their next life or spiritual salvation belong to the nonregulated section and those who follow the principles of prescribed duties in the scriptures are classified amongst the regulated section the nonregulated section both civilized and noncivilized educated and noneducated strong and weak are full of animal propensities their activities are never auspicious because enjoying the animal propensities of eating sleeping defending and mating they perpetually remain in material existence which is always miserable on the other hand those who are regulated by scriptural injunctions and thus gradually rise to ka consciousness certainly progress in life those who are then following the path of auspiciousness can be divided into three sections namely 1 the followers of scriptural rules and regulations who are enjoying material prosperity 2 those who are trying to find out the ultimate liberation from material existence and 3 those who are devotees in ka consciousness those who are following the rules and regulations of the scriptures for material happiness may be further divided into two classes those who are fruitive workers and those who desire no fruit for sense gratification those who are after fruitive results for sense gratification may be elevated to a higher standard of lifeeven to the higher planets but still because they are not free from material existence they are not following the truly auspicious path the only auspicious activities are those which lead one to liberation any activity which is not aimed at ultimate selfrealization or liberation from the material bodily concept of life is not at all auspicious activity in ka consciousness is the only auspicious activity and anyone who voluntarily accepts all bodily discomforts for the sake of making progress on the path of ka consciousness can be called a perfect transcendentalist under severe austerity and because the eightfold yoga system is directed toward the ultimate realization of ka consciousness such practice is also auspicious and no one who is trying his best in this matter need fear degradation text 41 prpya puyakt lokn uitv vat sam ucn rmat gehe yogabhrao bhijyate prpyaafter achieving puyaktmof those who

period of practice goes to the higher planets where pious living entities are allowed to enter after prolonged life there he is sent back again to this planet to take birth in the family of a righteous brhmaa vaiava or of aristocratic merchants the real purpose of yoga practice is to achieve the highest perfection of ka consciousness but those who do not persevere to such an extent and fail due to material allurements are allowed by the grace of the lord to make full utilization of their material propensities and after that they are given opportunities to live prosperous lives in

impetus from the very beginning of his life it is especially the case in the crya or gosvm families such families are very learned and devoted by tradition and training and thus they become spiritual masters in india there are many such crya families but they have now degenerated due to insufficient education and training by the grace of the lord there are still families that foster transcendentalists generation after generation it is certainly very fortunate to take birth in such families fortunately both our spiritual master om viupda r rmad bhaktisiddhnta sarasvat gosvm mahrja

in the family of a good brhmaa and was known as jaabharata because he always remained secluded and did not talk to anyone and later on he was discovered as the greatest transcendentalist by king

ritualistic principles of the scriptures purport advanced yogs are not very much attracted to the rituals of the scriptures but they automatically become attracted to the yoga principles which can elevate them to complete ka consciousness the highest yoga perfection in the rmadbhgavatam 3338 such disregard of vedic rituals by the advanced transcendentalists is explained as follows aho bata vapaco to garyn yajjihvgre vartate nma tubhyam tepus tapas te juhuvu sasnur ry brahmncur nma ganti ye te o my lord persons who chant the holy names of your lordship are far far advanced in spiritual life even if born in families of dogeaters such chanters have undoubtedly performed all kinds of austerities and sacrifices bathed in all sacred places and finished all scriptural studies the famous example of this was presented by lord caitanya who accepted hkur haridsa as one of his most important disciples although hkur haridsa happened to take his birth in a moslem family he was elevated to the post of nmcrya by lord caitanya due to his rigidly attended principle of chanting three hundred thousand holy names of the lord daily hare ka hare ka ka ka hare hare hare rma hare rma rma rma hare hare and because he chanted the holy name of the lord constantly it is understood that in his previous life he must have passed through all the ritualistic methods of the vedas known as abdabrahman

contaminations then ultimately after many many births of practice he attains the supreme goal purport a person born in a particularly righteous aristocratic or sacred family becomes conscious of his favorable condition for executing yoga practice with determination therefore he begins his unfinished task and thus he completely cleanses himself of all material contaminations when he is finally free from all contaminations he attains the supreme perfection ka consciousness ka consciousness is the perfect stage of being freed of all contaminations this is confirmed in the bhagavadgt ye tvantagata ppa jann puyakarmam te dvandvamohanirmukt bhajante m dhavrat after many many births of executing pious activities when one is completely freed from all contaminations and from all illusory

transcendentalist bhavajust become arjunao arjuna translation a yog is greater than the ascetic greater than the empiricist and greater than the fruitive worker therefore o arjuna in all circumstances be a yog purport when we speak of yoga we refer to linking up our consciousness with the supreme absolute truth such a process is named differently by various practitioners in terms of the particular method adopted when the linking up process is predominantly in fruitive activities it is called karmayoga when it is predominantly empirical it is called jnayoga and when it is predominantly in a devotional relationship with the supreme lord it is called bhaktiyoga bhaktiyoga or ka consciousness is the ultimate perfection of all yogas as will be explained in the next verse the lord has confirmed herein the superiority of yoga but he has not mentioned that it is better than bhaktiyoga bhaktiyoga is full spiritual knowledge and as such nothing can excel it asceticism without selfknowledge is imperfect empiric knowledge without surrender to the supreme lord is also imperfect and fruitive work without ka consciousness is a waste of time therefore the most highly praised form of yoga performance mentioned here is bhaktiyoga and this is still more clearly explained in the next verse text 47 yoginm api sarve madgatenntartman raddhvn bhajate yo m sa me yuktatamo mata

lord sahe memine yuktatamathe greatest yog matais considered translation and of all yogs he who always abides in me with great faith worshiping me in transcendental loving service is most intimately united with me in yoga and is the highest of all purport the word bhajete is significant here bhajete has its root in the verb bhaj which is used when there is need of service the english word worship cannot be used in the same sense as bhaja worship means to adore or to show respect and honor to the worthy one but service with love and faith is especially meant for the supreme personality of godhead one can avoid worshiping a respectable man or a demigod and may be called discourteous but one cannot avoid serving the supreme lord without being thoroughly condemned every living entity is part and parcel of the supreme personality of godhead and thus every living entity is intended to serve the supreme lord by his own constitution failing to do this he falls down the bhgavatam confirms this as follows ya e purua skd tmaprabhavam varam na bhajanty avajnanti sthnd bhra patanty adha anyone who does not render service and neglects his duty unto the primeval lord who is the source of all living entities will certainly fall down from his constitutional position in this verse also the word bhajanti is used therefore bhajanti is applicable to the supreme lord only whereas the word worship can be applied to demigods or to any other common living entity the word avajnanti used in this verse of rmadbhgavatam is also found in the bhagavadgt avajnanti m mh only the fools and rascals deride the supreme personality of godhead lord ka such fools take it upon themselves to write commentaries on the bhagavadgt without an attitude of service to the lord consequently they cannot properly distinguish between the word bhajanti and the word worship the culmination of all kinds of yoga practices lies in bhaktiyoga all other yogas are but means to come to the point of bhakti in bhaktiyoga yoga actually means bhaktiyoga all other yogas are progressions toward the destination of bhaktiyoga from the beginning of karmayoga to the end of bhaktiyoga is a long way to selfrealization karmayoga without fruitive results is the beginning of this path when karmayoga increases in knowledge and renunciation the stage is called jnayoga when jnayoga increases in meditation on the supersoul by different physical processes and the mind is on him it is called agayoga and when one surpasses the agayoga and comes to the point of the supreme personality of godhead ka it is called bhaktiyoga the culmination factually bhaktiyoga is the ultimate goal but to analyze bhaktiyoga minutely one has to understand these other yogas the yog who is progressive is therefore on the true path of eternal good fortune one who sticks to a particular point and does not make further progress is called by that particular name karmayog jnayog or dhynayog rjayog hahayog etc if one is fortunate enough to come to the point of bhaktiyoga it is to be understood that he has surpassed all the other yogas therefore to become ka conscious is the highest stage of yoga just as when we speak of himalayan we refer to the worlds highest mountains of which the highest peak mount everest is considered to be the culmination it is by great fortune that one comes to ka consciousness on the path of bhaktiyoga to become well situated according to the vedic direction the ideal yog concentrates his attention on ka who is called ymasundara who is as beautifully colored as a cloud whose lotuslike face is as effulgent as the sun whose dress is brilliant with jewels and whose body is flower garlanded illuminating all sides is his gorgeous luster which is called the brahmajyoti he incarnates in different forms such as rma nsiha varha and ka the supreme personality of godhead and he descends like a human being as the son of mother yaod and he is known as ka govinda and vsudeva he is the perfect child husband friend and master and he is full with all opulences and transcendental qualities if one remains fully conscious of these features of the lord he is called the highest yog this stage of highest perfection in yoga can be attained only by bhaktiyoga as is confirmed in all vedic literature yasya deve par bhaktir yath deve tath gurau tasyaite kathit hy arth prakante mahtmana only unto those great souls who have implicit faith in both the lord and the spiritual master are all the imports of vedic knowledge automatically revealed bhaktir asya bhajana tadihmutropdhi nairsyenmumin mana kalpanam etad eva naikarmyam bhakti means devotional service to the lord which is free from desire for material profit either in this life or in the next devoid of such inclinations one should fully absorb the mind in the supreme that is the purpose of naikarmya these are some of the means for performance of bhakti or ka consciousness the highest perfectional stage of the yoga

arjuna how by practicing yoga in full consciousness of me with mind attached to me you can know me in full free from doubt purport in this seventh chapter of bhagavadgt the nature of ka consciousness is fully described ka is full in all opulences and how he manifests such opulences is described herein also four kinds of fortunate people who become attached to ka and four kinds of unfortunate people who never take to ka are described in this chapter in the first six chapters of bhagavadgt the living entity has been described as nonmaterial spirit soul which is capable of elevating himself to selfrealization by different types of yogas at the end of the sixth chapter it has been clearly stated that the steady concentration of the mind upon ka or in other words ka consciousness is the highest form of all yoga by concentrating ones mind upon ka one is able to know the absolute truth completely but not otherwise impersonal brahmajyoti or localized paramtm realization is not perfect knowledge of the absolute truth because it is partial full and scientific knowledge is ka and everything is revealed to the person in ka consciousness in complete ka consciousness one knows that ka is ultimate knowledge beyond any doubts different types of yoga are only steppingstones on the path of ka consciousness one who takes directly to ka consciousness automatically knows about brahmajyoti and paramtm in full by practice of ka consciousness yoga one can know everything in fullnamely the absolute truth the living entities the material nature and their manifestations with paraphernalia one should therefore begin yoga practice as directed in the last verse of the sixth chapter concentration of the mind upon ka the supreme is made possible by prescribed devotional service in nine different forms of which ravaam is the first and most important the lord therefore says to arjuna tat u or hear from me no one can be a greater authority than ka and therefore by hearing from him one receives the greatest opportunity for progress in ka consciousness one has therefore to learn from ka directly or from a pure devotee of kaand not from a nondevotee upstart puffed up with academic education in the rmadbhgavatam this process of understanding ka the supreme personality of godhead the absolute truth is described in the second chapter of the first canto as follows vat svakath ka

vedic literatures or to hear from him directly through the bhagavadgt is itself righteous activity and for one who hears about ka lord ka who is dwelling in everyones heart acts as a bestwishing friend and purifies the devotee who constantly engages in hearing of him in this way a devotee naturally develops his dormant transcendental knowledge as he hears more about ka from the bhgavatam and from the devotees he becomes fixed in the devotional service of the lord by development of devotional service one becomes freed from the modes of passion and ignorance and thus material lusts and avarice are diminished when these impurities are wiped away the candidate remains steady in his position of pure goodness becomes enlivened by devotional service and understands the science of god perfectly thus bhaktiyoga severs the hard knot of material affection and enables one to come at once to the stage of asaaya samagramunderstanding of the supreme absolute truth personality of godhead bhg 121721 therefore only by hearing from ka or from his devotee in ka consciousness can one understand the science of ka text 2 jna te ha savijnam ida vakymy aeata yaj jtv neha bhyo nyaj jtavyam

system of knowledge because arjuna is kas confidential devotee and friend in the beginning of the fourth chapter this explanation was given by the lord and it is again confirmed here complete knowledge can be achieved only by the devotee of the lord directly from the lord in disciplic succession therefore one should be intelligent enough to know the source of all knowledge who is the cause of all causes and the only object for meditation in all types of yoga practices when the cause of all causes becomes known then everything knowable becomes known and nothing remains unknown the vedas

thousands among men one may endeavor for perfection and of those who have achieved perfection hardly one knows me in truth purport there are various grades of men and out of many thousands one may be sufficiently interested in transcendental realization to try to know what is the self what is the body and what is the absolute truth generally mankind is simply engaged in the animal propensities namely eating sleeping defending and mating and hardly anyone is interested in transcendental knowledge the first six chapters of the gt are meant for those who are interested in transcendental knowledge in understanding the self the superself and the process of realization by jnayoga dhynayoga and discrimination of the self from matter however ka can only be known by persons who are in ka consciousness other transcendentalists may achieve impersonal brahman realization for this is easier than understanding ka ka is the supreme person but at the same time he is beyond the knowledge of brahman and paramtm the yogs and jns are confused in their attempts to understand ka although the greatest of the impersonalists rpda akarcrya has admitted in his gt commentary that ka is the supreme personality of godhead but his followers do not accept ka as such for it is very difficult to know ka even though one has transcendental realization of impersonal brahman ka is the supreme personality of godhead the cause of all causes the primeval lord govinda vara parama ka saccidnandavigraha andir dir govinda sarvakraakraam it is very difficult for the nondevotees to know him although nondevotees declare that the path of bhakti or devotional service is very easy they cannot practice it if the path of bhakti is so easy as the nondevotee class of men proclaim then why do they take up the difficult path actually the path of bhakti is not easy the socalled path of bhakti practiced by unauthorized persons without knowledge of bhakti may be easy but when it is practiced factually according to the rules and regulations the speculative scholars and philosophers fall away from the path rla rpa gosvm writes in his bhaktirasmtasindhu rutismtipurdipacartravidhi vin aikntik harer bhaktir utptyaiva kalpate devotional service of the lord that ignores the authorized vedic literatures like the upaniads puras nradapacartra etc is simply an unnecessary disturbance in society it is not possible for the brahman realized impersonalist or the paramtm realized yog to understand ka the supreme personality of godhead as the son of mother yaod or the charioteer of arjuna even the great demigods are sometimes confused about ka muhyanti yat sraya m tu veda na kacana no one knows me as i am the lord says and if one does know him then sa mahtm sudurlabha such a great soul is very rare therefore unless one practices devotional service to the lord he cannot know ka as he is tattvata even though one is a great scholar or philosopher only the pure devotees can know something of the inconceivable transcendental qualities in ka in the cause of all causes in his omnipotence and opulence and in his wealth fame strength beauty knowledge and renunciation because ka is benevolently inclined to his devotees he is the last word in brahman realization and the devotees alone can realize him as he is therefore it is said ata rkanmdi na bhaved grhyam indriyai sevonmukhe hi jihvdau svayam eva sphuraty ada no one can understand ka as he is by the blunt material senses but he reveals himself to the devotees being pleased with them for their transcendental loving service unto him

each of them the third krodakay viu is diffused as the allpervading supersoul in all the universes and is known as paramtm who is present even within the atoms anyone who knows these three vius can be liberated from material entanglement this material world is a temporary manifestation of one of the energies of the lord all the activities of the material world are directed by these three viu expansions of lord ka these puruas are called incarnations generally one who does not know the science of god ka assumes that this material world is for the enjoyment of the living entities and that the living entities are the causes puruas controllers and enjoyers of the material energy according to bhagavadgt this atheistic conclusion is false in the verse under discussion it is stated that ka is the original cause of the material manifestation rmadbhgavatam also confirms this the ingredients of the material manifestation are separated energies of the lord even the brahmajyoti which is the ultimate goal of the impersonalists is a spiritual energy manifested in the spiritual sky there are no spiritual diversities in brahmajyoti as there are in the vaikuhalokas and the impersonalist accepts this brahmajyoti as the ultimate eternal goal the paramtm manifestation is also a temporary allpervasive aspect of the krodakay viu the paramtm manifestation is not eternal in the spiritual world therefore the factual absolute truth is the supreme personality of godhead ka he is the complete energetic person and he possesses different separated and internal energies in the material energy the principal manifestations are eight as above mentioned out of these the first five manifestations namely earth water fire air and sky are called the five gigantic creations or the gross creations within which the five sense objects are included they are the manifestations of physical sound touch form taste and smell material science comprises these ten items and nothing more but the other three items namely mind intelligence and false ego are neglected by the materialists philosophers who deal with mental activities are also not perfect in knowledge because they do not know the ultimate source ka the false egoi am and it is mine which constitute the basic principle of material existenceincludes ten sense organs for material activities intelligence refers to the total material creation called the mahattattva therefore from the eight separated energies of the lord are manifest the twentyfour elements of the material world which are the subject matter of skhya atheistic philosophy they are originally offshoots from kas energies and are separated from him but atheistic skhya philosophers with a poor fund of knowledge do not know ka as the cause of all causes the subject matter for discussion in the skhya philosophy is only the manifestation of the external energy of ka as it is described in the bhagavadgt text 5 apareyam itas tv any prakti viddhi me parm

one yayby whom idamthis dhryatebeing utilized or exploited jagatthe material world translation besides this inferior nature o mightyarmed arjuna there is a superior energy of mine which are all living entities who are struggling with material nature and are sustaining the universe purport here it is clearly mentioned that living entities belong to the superior nature or energy of the supreme lord the inferior energy is matter manifested in different elements namely earth water fire air ether mind intelligence and false ego both forms of material nature namely gross earth etc and subtle mind etc are products of the inferior energy the living entities who are exploiting these inferior energies for different purposes are the superior energy of the supreme lord and it is due to this energy that the entire material world functions the cosmic manifestation has no power to act unless it is moved by the superior energy the living entity energies are always controlled by the energetic and therefore living entities are always controlled by the lordthey have no independent existence they are never equally powerful as unintelligent men think the distinction between the living entities and the lord is described in rmadbhgavatam as follows 108730 aparimit dhruvs tanubhto yadi sarvagats tarhi na syateti niyamo dhruva netarath ajani ca yanmaya tad avimucya niyant bhavet samam anujnat yadamata mataduatay o supreme eternal if the embodied living entities were eternal and allpervading like you then they would not be under your control but if the living entities are accepted as minute energies of your lordship then they are at once subject to your supreme control therefore real liberation entails surrender by the living entities to your control and that surrender will make them happy in that constitutional position only can they be controllers therefore men with limited knowledge who advocate the monistic theory that god and the living entities are equal in all respects are actually misleading themselves and others the supreme lord ka is the only controller and all living entities are controlled by him these living entities are his superior energy because the quality of their existence is one and the same with the supreme but they are never equal to the lord in quantity of power while exploiting the gross and subtle inferior energy matter the superior energy the living entity forgets his real spiritual mind and intelligence this forgetfulness is due to the influence of matter upon the living entity but when the living entity becomes free from the influence of the illusory material energy he attains the stage called mukti or liberation the false ego under the influence of material illusion thinks i am matter and material acquisitions are mine his actual position is realized when he is liberated from all material ideas including the conception of his becoming one in all respects with god therefore one may conclude that the gt confirms the living entity to be only one of the multienergies of ka and when this energy is freed from material contamination it becomes fully ka conscious or liberated text 6 etad yonni bhtni sarvty upadhraya aha

everything that exists is a product of matter and spirit spirit is the basic field of creation and matter is created by spirit spirit is not created at a certain stage of material development rather this material world is manifested only on the basis of spiritual energy this material body is developed because spirit is present within matter a child grows gradually to boyhood and then to manhood because of that superior energy spirit soul being present similarly the entire cosmic manifestation of the gigantic universe is developed because of the presence of the supersoul viu therefore spirit and matter which combine together to manifest this gigantic universal form are originally two energies of the lord and consequently the lord is the original cause of everything a fragmental part and parcel of the lord namely the living entity may by manipulation of material energy construct a skyscraper factory or city but he cannot create matter out of nothing and he certainly cannot construct a planet or a universe the cause of the universe is the supersoul ka the supreme creator of all individual souls and the original cause of all causes as the kaha upaniad confirms nityo nityn cetana cetannm text 7 matta paratara nnyat kicid asti dhanajaya mayi sarvam ida prota stre maiga iva mattabeyond myself parataramsuperior nanot anyat anything else kicitsomething astithere is dhanajayao conquerer of wealth mayiin me sarvamall that be idamwhich we see protam strung streon a thread maigapearls ivalikened translation o conquerer of wealth arjuna there is no truth superior to me everything rests upon me as pearls are strung on a thread purport there is a common controversy over whether the supreme absolute truth is personal or impersonal as far as bhagavadgt is concerned the absolute truth is the personality of godhead r ka and this is confirmed in every step in this verse in particular it is stressed that the absolute truth is a person that the personality of godhead is the supreme absolute truth is also the affirmation of the brahmasahit vara parama ka saccidnandavigraha that is the supreme absolute truth personality of godhead is lord ka who is the primeval lord the reservoir of all pleasure govinda and the eternal form of complete bliss and knowledge these authorities leave no doubt that the absolute truth is the supreme person the cause of all causes the impersonalist however argues on the strength of the vedic version given in the vetvatara upaniad tato yad uttaratara tad arpam anmaya ya etad vidur amts te bhavanti athetare dukham evpi yanti in the material world brahm the primeval living entity within the universe is understood to be the supreme amongst the demigods human beings and lower animals but beyond brahm there is the transcendence who has no material form and is free from all material contaminations anyone who can know him also becomes transcendental but those who do not know him suffer the miseries of the material world the impersonalist puts more stress on the word arpam but this arpam is not impersonal it indicates the transcendental form of eternity bliss and knowledge as described in the brahmasahit quoted above other verses in the vetvatara upaniad substantiate this as follows vedham eta purua mahntam dityavara tamasa parastt tam eva vidvn amta iha bhavati nnya panth vidyate ayanya yasmt para nparam asti kicid yasmnnyo na jyyo sti kicit i know that supreme personality of godhead who is transcendental to all material conceptions of darkness only he who knows him can transcend the bonds of birth and death there is no way for liberation other than this knowledge of that supreme person there is no truth superior to that supreme person because he is the supermost he is smaller than the smallest and he is greater than the greatest he is situated as a silent tree and he illumines the transcendental sky and as a tree spreads its roots he spreads his extensive energies from these verses one concludes that the supreme absolute truth is the supreme personality of godhead who is allpervading by his multienergies both material and spiritual text 8 raso ham apsu kaunteya prabhsmi aisryayo

vedas ab dasound vibration khein the ether pauruamability nuin man translation o son of kunt arjuna i am the taste of water the light of the sun and the moon the syllable om in the vedic mantras i am the sound in ether and ability in man purport this verse explains how the lord is allpervasive by his diverse material and spiritual energies the supreme lord can be preliminarily perceived by his different energies and in this way he is realized impersonally as the demigod in the sun is a person and is perceived by his allpervading energy the sunshine similarly the lord although in his eternal abode is perceived by his allpervading diffusive energies the taste of water is the active principle of water no one likes to drink sea water because the pure taste of water is mixed with salt attraction for water depends on the purity of the taste and this pure taste is one of the energies of the lord the impersonalist perceives the presence of the lord in water by its taste and the personalist also glorifies the lord for his kindly supplying water to quench mans thirst that is the way of perceiving the supreme practically speaking there is no conflict between personalism and impersonalism one who knows god knows that the impersonal conception and personal conception are simultaneously present in everything and that there is no contradiction therefore lord caitanya established his sublime doctrine acintyabheda and abheda tattvamsimultaneously one and different the light of the sun and the moon is also originally emanating from the brahmajyoti which is the impersonal effulgence of the lord similarly praava or the omkra transcendental sound used in the beginning of every vedic hymn to address the supreme lord also emanates from him because the impersonalists are very much afraid of addressing the supreme lord ka by his innumerable names they prefer to vibrate the transcendental sound omkra but they do not realize that omkra is the sound representation of ka the jurisdiction of ka consciousness extends everywhere and one who knows ka consciousness is blessed those who do not know ka are in illusion and so knowledge of ka is liberation and ignorance of him is bondage text 9 puyo gandha pthivy ca teja csmi vibhvasau jvana sarvabhteu tapa csmi tapasviu puyaoriginal gandhafragrance pthivymin the earth ca also tejatemperature caalso

the modes and inexhaustible purport the whole world is enchanted by three modes of material nature those who are bewildered by these three modes cannot understand that transcendental to this material nature is the supreme lord ka in this material world everyone is under the influence of these three guas and is thus bewildered by nature living entities have particular types of body and particular types of psychic and biological activities accordingly there are four classes of men functioning in the three material modes of nature those who are purely in the mode of goodness are called brhmaas those who are purely in the mode of passion are called katriyas those who are in the modes of both passion and ignorance are called vaiyas those who are completely in ignorance are called dras and those who are less than that are animals or animal life however these designations are not permanent i may either be a brhmaa katriya vaiya or whateverin any case this life is temporary but although life is temporary and we do not know what we are going to be in the next life still by the spell of this illusory energy we consider ourselves in the light of this bodily conception of life and we thus think that we are american indian russian or brhmaa hindu muslim etc and if we become entangled with the modes of material nature then we forget the supreme personality of godhead who is behind all these modes so lord ka says that men deluded by these three modes of nature do not understand that behind the material background is the supreme godhead there are many different kinds of living entitieshuman beings demigods animals etcand each and every one of them is under the influence of material nature and all of them have forgotten the transcendent personality of godhead those who are in the modes of passion and ignorance and even those who are in the mode of goodness cannot go beyond the impersonal brahman conception of the absolute truth they are bewildered before the supreme lord in his personal feature which possesses all beauty opulence knowledge strength fame and renunciation when even those who are in goodness cannot understand what hope is there for those in passion and ignorance ka consciousness is transcendental to all these three modes of material nature and those who are truly established in ka consciousness are actually liberated text 14 daiv hy e guamay

mmunto me evacertainly yethose prapadyantesurrender mym etmthis illusory energy taranti overcome tethey translation this divine energy of mine consisting of the three modes of material nature is difficult to overcome but those who have surrendered unto me can easily cross beyond it purport the supreme personality of godhead has innumerable energies and all these energies are divine although the living entities are part of his energies and are therefore divine due to contact with material energy their original superior power is covered being thus covered by material energy one cannot possibly overcome its influence as previously stated both the material and spiritual natures being emanations from the supreme personality of godhead are eternal the living entities belong to the eternal superior nature of the lord but due to contamination by the inferior nature matter their illusion is also eternal the conditioned soul is therefore called nityabaddha or eternally conditioned no one can trace out the history of his becoming conditioned at a certain date in material history consequently his release from the clutches of material nature is very difficult even though that material nature is an inferior energy because material energy is ultimately conducted by the supreme will which the living entity cannot overcome inferior material nature is defined herein as divine nature due to its divine connection and movement by the divine will being conducted by divine will material nature although inferior acts so wonderfully in the construction and destruction of the cosmic manifestation the vedas confirm this as follows my tu prakti vidyn myina tu mahevaram although my illusion is false or temporary the background of my is the supreme magician the personality of godhead who is mahevara the supreme controller another meaning of gua is rope it is to be understood that the conditioned soul is tightly tied by the ropes of illusion a man bound by the hands and feet cannot free himselfhe must be helped by a person who is unbound because the bound cannot help the bound the rescuer must be liberated therefore only lord ka or his bona fide representative the spiritual master can release the conditioned soul without such superior help one cannot be freed from the bondage of material nature devotional service or ka consciousness can help one gain such release ka being the lord of illusory energy can order this insurmountable energy to release the conditioned soul he orders this release out of his causeless mercy on the surrendered soul and out of his paternal affection for the living entity who is originally a beloved son of the lord therefore surrender unto the lotus feet of the lord is the only means to get free from the clutches of the stringent material nature the words mm eva are also significant mm means unto ka viu only and not brahm or iva although brahm and iva are greatly elevated and are almost on the level of viu it is not possible for such incarnations of rjogua passion and tamogua ignorance to release the conditioned soul from the clutches of my in other words both brahm and iva are also under the influence of my only viu is the master of my therefore he can alone give release to the conditioned soul the vedas confirm this in the phrase tvam eva viditv or freedom is possible only by understanding ka even lord iva affirms that liberation can be achieved only by the mercy of viu lord iva says muktipradt sarve viur eva na saaya there is no doubt that viu is the deliverer of liberation for everyone text 15 na m

atheistic nature of demons do not surrender unto me purport it is said in bhagavadgt that simply by surrendering oneself unto the lotus feet of the supreme personality ka one can surmount the stringent laws of material nature at this point a question arises how is it that educated philosophers scientists businessmen administrators and all the leaders of ordinary men do not surrender to the lotus feet of r ka the allpowerful personality of godhead mukti or liberation from the laws of material nature is sought by the leaders of mankind in different ways and with great plans and perseverance for a great many years and births but if that liberation is possible by simply surrendering unto the lotus feet of the supreme personality of godhead then why dont these intelligent and hardworking leaders adopt this simple method the gt answers this question very frankly those really learned leaders of society like brahm iva kapila the kumras manu vysa devala asita janaka prahlda bali and later on madhvcrya rmnujcrya r caitanya and many otherswho are faithful philosophers politicians educators scientists etcsurrender to the lotus feet of the supreme person the allpowerful authority those who are not actually philosophers scientists educators administrators etc but who pose themselves as such for material gain do not accept the plan or path of the supreme lord they have no idea of god they simply manufacture their own worldly plans and consequently complicate the problems of material existence in their vain attempts to solve them because material energy nature is so powerful it can resist the unauthorized plans of the atheists and baffle the knowledge of planning commissions the atheistic planmakers are described herein by the word duktina or miscreants ktina means one who has performed meritorious work the atheist planmaker is sometimes very intelligent and meritorious also because any gigantic plan good or bad must take intelligence to execute but because the atheists brain is improperly utilized in opposing the plan of the supreme lord the atheistic planmaker is called duktina which indicates that his intelligence and efforts are misdirected in the gt it is clearly mentioned that material energy works fully under the direction of the supreme lord it has no independant authority it works as the shadow moves in accordance with the movements of the object but still material energy is very powerful and the atheist due to his godless temperament cannot know how it works nor can he know the plan of the supreme lord under illusion and the modes of passion and ignorance all his plans are baffled as in the case of hirayakaipu and rvaa whose plans were smashed to dust although they were both materially learned as scientists philosophers administrators and educators these duktinas or miscreants are of four different patterns as outlined below 1 the mhas are those who are grossly foolish like hardworking beasts of burden they want to enjoy the fruits of their labor by themselves and so do not want to part with them for the supreme the typical example of the beast of burden is the ass this humble beast is made to work very hard by his master the ass does not really know for whom he works so hard day and night he remains satisfied by filling his stomach with a bundle of grass sleeping for a while under fear of being beaten by his master and satisfying his sex appetite at the risk of being repeatedly kicked by the opposite party the ass sings poetry and philosophy sometimes but this braying only disturbs others this is the position of the foolish fruitive worker who does not know for whom he should work he does not know that karma action is meant for yaja sacrifice most often those who work very hard day and night to clear the burden of selfcreated duties say that they have no time to hear of the immortality of the living being to such mhas material gains which are destructible are lifes all in alldespite the fact that the mhas enjoy only a very small fraction of the fruit of labor sometimes they spend sleepless days and nights for fruitive gain and although they may have ulcers or indigestion they are satisfied with practically no food they are simply absorbed in working hard day and night for the benefit of illusory masters ignorant of their real master the foolish workers waste their valuable time serving mammon unfortunately they never surrender to the supreme master of all masters nor do they take time to hear of him from the proper sources the swine who eat the soil do not care to accept sweetmeats made of sugar and ghee similarly the foolish worker will untiringly continue to hear of the senseenjoyable tidings of the flickering mundane force that moves the material world 2 another class of duktina or miscreant is called the nardhama or the lowest of mankind nara means human being and adhama means the lowest out of the 8400000 different species of living beings there are 400000 human species out of these there are numerous lower forms of human life that are mostly uncivilized the civilized human beings are those who have regulated principles of social political and religious life those who are socially and politically developed but who have no religious principles must be considered nardhamas nor is religion without god religion because the purpose of following religious principles is to know the supreme truth and mans relation with him in the gt the personality of godhead clearly states that there is no authority above him and that he is the supreme truth the civilized form of human life is meant for mans reviving the lost consciousness of his eternal relation with the supreme truth the personality of godhead r ka who is allpowerful whoever loses this chance is classified as a nardhama we get information from revealed scriptures that when the baby is in the mothers womb an extremely uncomfortable situation he prays to god for deliverance and promises to worship him alone as soon as he gets out to pray to god when he is in difficulty is a natural instinct in every living being because he is eternally related with god but after his deliverance the child forgets the difficulties of birth and forgets his deliverer also being influenced by my the illusory energy it is the duty of the guardians of children to revive the divine consciousness dormant in them the ten processes of reformatory ceremonies as enjoined in the manusmti which is the guide to religious principles are meant for reviving god consciousness in the system of varrama however no process is strictly followed now in any part of the world and therefore 999 percent of the population is nardhama when the whole population becomes nardhama naturally all their socalled education is made null and void by the allpowerful energy of physical nature according to the standard of the gt a learned man is he who sees on equal terms the learned brhmaa the dog the cow the elephant and the dogeater that is the vision of a true devotee r nitynanda prabhu who is the incarnation of godhead as divine master delivered the typical nardhamas the brothers jagai and madhai and showed how the mercy of a real devotee is bestowed upon the lowest of mankind so the nardhama who is condemned by the personality of godhead can again revive his spiritual consciousness only by the mercy of a devotee r caitanya mahprabhu in propagating the bhgavatadharma or activities of the devotees has recommended that people submissively hear the message of the personality of godhead the essence of this message is bhagavadgt the lowest amongst human beings can be delivered by this submissive hearing process only but unfortunately they even deny giving an aural reception to these messages and what to speak of surrendering to the will of the supreme lord nardhamas or the lowest of mankind will fully neglect the prime duty of the human being 3 the next class of duktina is called myaypahtajna or those persons whose erudite knowledge has been nullified by the influence of illusory material energy they are mostly very learned fellowsgreat philosophers poets literati scientists etcbut the illusory energy misguides them and therefore they disobey the supreme lord there are a great number of myaypahtajnas at the present moment even amongst the scholars of the gt in the gt in plain and simple language it is stated that r ka is the supreme personality of godhead there is none equal to or greater than him he is mentioned as the father of brahm the original father of all human beings in fact r ka is said to be not only the father of brahm but also the father of all species of life he is the root of the impersonal brahman and paramtm the supersoul in every entity is his plenary portion he is the fountainhead of everything and everyone is advised to surrender unto his lotus feet despite all these clear statements the myaypahtajna deride the personality of the supreme lord and consider him merely another human being they do not know that the blessed form of human life is designed after the eternal and transcendental feature of the supreme lord all the unauthorized interpretations of the gt by the class of myaypahtajna outside the purview of the parampar system are so many stumbling blocks in the path of spiritual understanding the deluded interpreters do not surrender unto the lotus feet of r ka nor do they teach others to follow this principle 4 the last class of duktina is called sura bhvam rita or those of demonic principles this class is openly atheistic some of them argue that the supreme lord can never descend upon this material world but they are unable to give any tangible reasons as to why not there are others who make him subordinate to the impersonal feature although the opposite is declared in the gt envious of the supreme personality of godhead the atheist will present a number of illicit incarnations manufactured in the factory of his brain such persons whose very principle of life is to decry the personality of godhead cannot surrender unto the lotus feet of r ka r ymuncrya albandru of south india said o my lord you are unknowable to persons involved with atheistic principles despite your uncommon qualities features and activities and despite your personality being confirmed by all the revealed scriptures in the quality of goodness and despite your being acknowledged by the famous authorities renowned for their depth of knowledge in the transcendental science and situated in the godly qualities therefore 1 grossly foolish persons 2 the lowest of mankind 3 the deluded speculators and 4 the professed atheists as above mentioned never surrender unto the lotus feet of the personality of godhead in spite of all scriptural and authoritative advice text 16 caturvidh bhajante m jan suktino rjuna rto jijsur arthrth jn ca bharatarabha caturvidhfour kinds of bhajanterender

bharatarabhao great one amongst the descendants of bharata translation o best among the bhratas arjuna four kinds of pious men render devotional service unto methe distressed the desirer of wealth the inquisitive and he who is searching for knowledge of the absolute purport unlike the miscreants these are adherents of the regulative principles of the scriptures and they are called suktina or those who obey the rules and regulations of scriptures the moral and social laws and are more or less devoted to the supreme lord out of these there are four classes of men those who are sometimes distressed those who are in need of money those who are sometimes inquisitive and those who are sometimes searching after knowledge of the absolute truth these persons come to the supreme lord for devotional service under different conditions these are not pure devotees because they have some aspiration to fulfill in exchange for devotional service pure devotional service is without aspiration and without desire for material profit the bhaktirasmtasindhu defines pure devotion thus anybhilitnya jnakarmdyanvtam nuklyena knulana bhaktir uttam one should render transcendental loving service to the supreme lord ka favorably and without desire for material profit or gain through fruitive activities or philosophical speculation that is called pure devotional service when these four kinds of persons come to the supreme lord for devotional service and are completely purified by the association of a pure devotee they also become pure devotees as far as the miscreants are concerned for them devotional service is very difficult because their lives are selfish irregular and without spiritual goals but even some of them by chance when they come in contact with a pure devotee also become pure devotees those who are always busy with fruitive activities come to the lord in material distress and at that time associate with pure devotees and become in their distress devotees of the lord those who are simply frustrated also come sometimes to associate with the pure devotees and become inquisitive to know about god similarly when the dry philosophers are frustrated in every field of knowledge they sometimes want to learn of god and they come to the supreme lord to render devotional service and thus transcend knowledge of the impersonal brahman and the localized paramtm and come to the personal conception of godhead by the grace of the supreme lord or his pure devotee on the whole when the distressed the inquisitive the seekers of knowledge and those who are in need of money are free from all material desires and when they fully understand that material remuneration has nothing to do with spiritual improvement they become pure devotees as long as such a purified stage is not attained devotees in transcendental service to the lord are tainted with fruitive activities and they search after mundane knowledge etc so one has to transcend all this before one can come to the stage of pure devotional service text 17 te jn nityayukta ekabhaktir viiyate priyo hi jnino tyartham aha sa ca mama priya temout of them jnone in full knowledge nityayuktaalways engaged ekaonly one

full knowledge in union with me through pure devotional service is the best for i am very dear to him and he is dear to me purport free from all contaminations of material desires the distressed the inquisitive the penniless and the seeker after supreme knowledge can all become pure devotees but out of them he who is in knowledge of the absolute truth and free from all material desires becomes a really pure devotee of the lord and of the four orders the devotee who is in full knowledge and is at the same time engaged in devotional service is the lord says the best by searching after knowledge one realizes that his self is different from his material body and when further advanced he comes to the knowledge of impersonal brahman and paramtm when one is fully purified he realizes that his constitutional position is to be the eternal servant of god so by association with pure devotees the inquisitive the distressed the seeker after material amelioration and the man in knowledge all become themselves pure but in the preparatory stage the man who is in full knowledge of the supreme lord and is at the same time executing devotional service is very dear to the lord he who is situated in pure knowledge of the transcendence of the supreme personality of god is so protected in devotional service that material contaminations cannot touch him text 18 udr sarva evaite jn tv

situated in knowledge of me i consider verily to dwell in me being engaged in my transcendental service he attains me purport it is not that other devotees who are less complete in knowledge are not dear to the lord the lord says that all are magnanimous because anyone who comes to the lord for any purpose is called a mahtm or great soul the devotees who want some benefit out of devotional service are accepted by the lord because there is an exchange of affection out of affection they ask the lord for some material benefit and when they get it they become so satisfied that they also advance in devotional service but the devotee in full knowledge is considered to be very dear to the lord because his only purpose is to serve the supreme lord with love and devotion such a devotee cannot live a second without contacting or serving the supreme lord similarly the supreme lord is very fond of his devotee and cannot be separated from him in the rmadbhgavatam 9457 the lord says aha bhaktapardhno hy asvatantra iva dvija sdhubhir grastahdayo bhaktair bhaktajanapriya the devotees are always in my heart and i am always in the heart of the devotees the devotee does not know anything beyond me and i also cannot forget the devotee there is a very intimate relationship between me and the pure devotees pure devotees in full knowledge are never out of spiritual touch and therefore they are very much dear to me text 19 bahn janmanm ante jnavn m prapadyate vsudeva sarvam iti sa mahtm sudurlabha bahnmmany janmanmbirths anteafter jnavnhe possessing knowledge mmunto me

me knowing me to be the cause of all causes and all that is such a great soul is very rare purport the living entity while executing devotional service or transcendental rituals after many many births may actually become situated in transcendental pure knowledge that the supreme personality of godhead is the ultimate goal of spiritual realization in the beginning of spiritual realization while one is trying to give up ones attachment to materialism there is some leaning towards impersonalism but when one is further advanced he can understand that there are activities in the spiritual life and that these activities constitute devotional service realizing this he becomes attached to the supreme personality of godhead and surrenders to him at such a time one can understand that lord r kas mercy is everything that he is the cause of all causes and that this material manifestation is not independent from him he realizes the material world to be a perverted reflection of spiritual variegatedness and realizes that in everything there is a relationship with the supreme lord ka thus he thinks of everything in relation to vsudeva or r ka such a universal vision of vsudeva precipitates ones full surrender to the supreme lord r ka as the highest goal such surrendered great souls are very rare this verse is very nicely explained in the third chapter of vetvatara upaniad in this body there are powers of speaking of seeing of hearing of mental activities etc but these are not important if not related to the supreme lord and because vsudeva is allpervading and everything is vsudeva the devotee surrenders in full knowledge cf bhagavadgt 717 and 1140 text 20 kmais tais tair htajn prapadyante nyadevat ta ta niyamam sthya prakty niyat svay kamaiby desires taiby

whose minds are distorted by material desires surrender unto demigods and follow the particular rules and regulations of worship according to their own natures purport those who are freed from all material contaminations surrender unto the supreme lord and engage in his devotional service as long as the material contamination is not completely washed off they are by nature nondevotees but even those who have material desires and who resort to the supreme lord are not so much attracted by external nature because of approaching the right goal they soon become free from all material lust in the rmadbhgavatam it is recommended that whether one is free from all material desires or is full of material desires or desires liberation from material contamination or is a pure devotee and has no desire for material sense gratification he should in all cases surrender to vsudeva and worship him it is said in the bhgavatam that less intelligent people who have lost their spiritual sense take shelter of demigods for immediate fulfillment of material desires generally such people do not go to the supreme personality of godhead because they are in particular modes of nature ignorance and passion and therefore worship various demigods following the rules and regulations of worship they are satisfied the worshipers of demigods are motivated by small desires and do not know how to reach the supreme goal but a devotee of the supreme lord is not misguided because in vedic literature there are recommendations for worshiping different gods for different purposes eg a diseased man is recommended to worship the sun those who are not devotees of the lord think that for certain purposes demigods are better than the supreme lord but a pure devotee knows that the supreme lord ka is the master of all in the caitanyacaritmta it is said that only the supreme personality of godhead ka is master and all others are servants therefore a pure devotee never goes to demigods for satisfaction of his material needs he depends on the supreme lord and the pure devotee is satisfied with whatever he gives text 21 yo yo y y tanu bhakta raddhayrcitum icchati tasya tasycal raddh tm eva vidadhmy

vidadhmigive ahami translation i am in everyones heart as the supersoul as soon as one desires to worship the demigods i make his faith steady so that he can devote himself to some particular deity purport god has given independence to everyone therefore if a person desires to have material enjoyment and wants very sincerely to have such facilities from the material demigods the supreme lord as supersoul in everyones heart understands and gives facilities to such persons as the supreme father of all living entities he does not interfere with their independence but gives all facilities so that they can fulfill their material desires some may ask why the allpowerful god gives facilities to the living entities for enjoying this material world and so lets them fall into the trap of the illusory energy the answer is that if the supreme lord as supersoul does not give such facilities then there is no meaning to independence therefore he gives everyone full independencewhatever one likesbut his ultimate instruction we find in the bhagavadgt man should give up all other engagements and fully surrender unto him that will make man happy both the living entity and the demigods are subordinate to the will of the supreme personality of godhead therefore the living entity cannot worship the demigod by his own desire nor can the demigod bestow any benediction without the supreme will as it is said not a blade of grass moves without the will of the supreme personality of godhead generally persons who are distressed in the material world go to the demigods as they are advised in the vedic literature a person wanting some particular thing may worship such and such a demigod for example a diseased person is recommended to worship the sungod a person wanting education may worship the goddess of learning sarasvat and a person wanting a beautiful wife may worship the goddess um the wife of lord iva in this way there are recommendations in the stras vedic scriptures for different modes of worship of different demigods and because a particular living entity wants to enjoy a particular material facility the lord inspires him with a strong desire to achieve that benediction from that particular demigod and so he successfully receives the benediction the particular mode of the devotional attitude of the living entity toward a particular type of demigod is also arranged by the supreme lord the demigods cannot infuse the living entities with such an affinity but because he is the supreme lord or the supersoul who is present in the heart of all living entities ka gives impetus to man to worship certain demigods the demigods are actually different parts of the universal body of the supreme lord therefore they have no independence in the vedic literature taittirya upaniad first anuvka it is stated the supreme personality of godhead as supersoul is also present within the heart of the demigod therefore he arranges through the demigod to fulfill the desire of the living entity but both the demigod and the living entity are dependent on the supreme wil1 they are not independent text 22 sa tay raddhay yuktas tasyrdhanam hate labhate ca tata kmn

translation endowed with such a faith he seeks favors of a particular demigod and obtains his desires but in actuality these benefits are bestowed by me alone purport the demigods cannot award benediction to the devotees without the permission of the supreme lord the living entity may forget that everything is the property of the supreme lord but the demigods do not forget so the worship of demigods and achievement of desired results are not due to the demigods but to the supreme personality of godhead by arrangement the less intelligent living entity does not know this and therefore he foolishly goes to the demigods for some benefit but the pure devotee when in need of something prays only to the supreme lord asking for material benefit however is not a sign of a pure devotee a living entity goes to the demigods usually because he is mad to fulfill his lust this happens when something undue is desired by the living entity and the lord himself does not fulfill the desire in the caitanyacaritmta it is said that one who worships the supreme lord and at the same time desires material enjoyment is contradictory in his desires devotional service of the supreme lord and the worship of a demigod cannot be on the same platform because worship of a demigod is material and devotional service to the supreme lord is completely spiritual for the living entity who desires to return to godhead material desires are impediments a pure devotee of the lord is therefore not awarded the material benefits desired by less intelligent living entities who prefer to worship demigods of the material world rather than engage in devotional service of the supreme lord text 23 antavat tu phala te tad bhavaty alpamedhasm devn devayajo ynti madbhakt ynti mm api antavat tulimited and

me api surely translation men of small intelligence worship the demigods and their fruits are limited and temporary those who worship the demigods go to the planets of the demigods but my devotees ultimately reach my supreme planet purport some commentators on the gt say that one who worships a demigod can reach the supreme lord but here it is clearly stated that the worshipers of demigods go to the different planetary systems where various demigods are situated just as a worshiper of the sun achieves the sun or a worshiper of the demigod of the moon achieves the moon similarly if anyone wants to worship a demigod like indra he can attain that particular gods planet it is not that everyone regardless of whatever demigod is worshiped will reach the supreme personality of godhead that is denied here for it is clearly stated that the worshipers of demigods go to different planets in the material world but the devotee of the supreme lord goes directly to the supreme planet of the personality of godhead here the point may be raised that if the demigods are different parts of the body of the supreme lord then the same end should be achieved by worshiping them however worshipers of the demigods are less intelligent because they dont know to what part of the body food must be supplied some of them are so foolish that they claim that there are many parts and many ways to supply food this isnt very sanguine can anyone supply food to the body through the ears or eyes they do not know that these demigods are different parts of the universal body of the supreme lord and in their ignorance they believe that each and every demigod is a separate god and a competitor of the supreme lord not only are demigods parts of the supreme lord but ordinary living entities are also in the rmadbhgavatam it is stated that the brhmaas are the head of the supreme lord the katriyas are the arms etc and that all serve different functions regardless of the situation if one knows that both the demigods and himself are part and parcel of the supreme lord his knowledge is perfect but if he does not understand this he achieves different planets where the demigods reside this is not the same destination the devotee reaches the results achieved by the demigods benedictions are perishable because within this material world the planets the demigods and their worshipers are all perishable therefore it is clearly stated in this verse that all results achieved by worshiping demigods are perishable and therefore such worship is performed by the less intelligent living entity because the pure devotee engaged in ka consciousness in devotional service of the supreme lord achieves eternal blissful existence that is full of knowledge his achievements and those of the common worshiper of the demigods are different the supreme lord is unlimited his favor is unlimited his mercy is unlimited therefore the mercy of the supreme lord upon his pure devotees is unlimited text 24 avyakta

due to their small knowledge they do not know my higher nature which is changeless and supreme purport those who are worshipers of demigods have been described as less intelligent persons and here the impersonalists are similarly described lord ka in his personal form is here speaking before arjuna and still due to ignorance impersonalists argue that the supreme lord ultimately has no form ymuncrya a great devotee of the lord in the disciplic succession from rmnujcrya has written two very appropriate verses in this connection he says my dear lord devotees like vysadeva and nrada know you to be the personality of godhead by understanding different vedic literatures one can come to know your characteristics your form and your activities and one can thus understand that you are the supreme personality of godhead but those who are in the modes of passion and ignorance the demons the nondevotees cannot understand you they are unable to understand you however expert such nondevotees may be in discussing vednta and the upaniads and other vedic literatures it is not possible for them to understand the personality of godhead in the brahmasahit it is stated that the personality of godhead cannot be understood simply by study of the vednta literature only by the mercy of the supreme lord can the personality of the supreme be known therefore in this verse it is clearly stated that not only the worshipers of the demigods are less intelligent but those nondevotees who are engaged in vednta and speculation on vedic literature without any tinge of true ka consciousness are also less intelligent and for them it is not possible to understand gods personal nature persons who are under the impression that the absolute truth is impersonal are described as asuras which means one who does not know the ultimate feature of the absolute truth in the rmadbhgavatam it is stated that supreme realization begins from the impersonal brahman and then rises to the localized supersoulbut the ultimate word in the absolute truth is the personality of godhead modern impersonalists are still less intelligent for they do not even follow their great predecessor akarcrya who has specifically stated that ka is the supreme personality of godhead impersonalists therefore not knowing the supreme truth think ka to be only the son of devak and vasudeva or a prince or a powerful living entity this is also condemned in bhagavadgt only the fools regard me as an ordinary person the fact is that no one can understand ka without rendering devotional service and without developing ka consciousness the gt confirms this one cannot understand the supreme personality of godhead ka or his form quality or name simply by mental speculation or by discussing vedic literature one must understand him by devotional service when one is fully engaged in ka consciousness beginning by chanting the mahmantrahare ka hare ka ka ka hare harehare rma hare rma rma rma hare harethen only can one understand the supreme personality of godhead nondevotee impersonalists think that ka has a body made of this material nature and that all his activities his form and everything are my these impersonalists are known as myvd they do not know the ultimate truth the twentieth verse clearly states those who are blinded by lusty desires surrender unto the different demigods it is accepted that besides the supreme personality of godhead there are demigods who have theirdifferent planets bg 723 and the lord also has a planet it is also stated that the worshipers of the demigods go to the different planets of the demigods and those who are devotees of lord ka go to the kaloka planet although this is clearly stated the foolish impersonalists still maintain that the lord is formless and that these forms are impositions from the study of the gt does it appear that the demigods and their abodes are impersonal clearly neither the demigods nor ka the supreme personality of godhead are impersonal they are all persons lord ka is the supreme personality of godhead and he has his own planet and the demigods have theirs therefore the monistic contention that ultimate truth is formless and that form is imposed does not hold true it is clearly stated here that it is not imposed from the gt we can clearly understand that the forms of the demigods and the form of the supreme lord are simultaneously existing and that lord ka is saccidnanda eternal blissful knowledge the vedas also confirm that the supreme absolute truth is nandamaya or full of blissful pleasure and that he is abhyst by nature the reservoir of unlimited auspicious qualities and in the gt the lord says that although he is aja unborn he still appears these are the facts that we should understand from the gt we cannot understand how the supreme personality of godhead can be impersonal the imposition theory of the impersonalist monist is false as far as the statements of the gt are concerned it is clear herein that the supreme absolute truth lord ka has both form and personality text 25 nha praka sarvasya yogamysamvta mho ya nbhijnti loko mm ajam avyayam nanor ahami prakamanifest sarvasyato everyone

foolish and unintelligent for them i am covered by my eternal creative potency yogamy and so the deluded world knows me not who am unborn and infallible purport it may be argued that since ka was present on this earth and was visible to everyone then why isnt he manifest to everyone now but actually he was not manifest to everyone when ka was present there were only a few people who could understand him to be the supreme personality of godhead in the assembly of kurus when iupla spoke against ka being elected president of the assembly bhma supported him and proclaimed him to be the supreme god similarly the pavas and a few others knew that he was the supreme but not everyone he was not revealed to the nondevotees and the common man therefore in the gt ka says that but for his pure devotees all men consider him to be like themselves he was manifest only to his devotees as the reservoir of all pleasure but to others to unintelligent nondevotees he was covered by his eternal potency in the prayers of kunt in the rmadbhgavatam 1818 it is said that the lord is covered by the curtain of yogamy and thus ordinary people cannot understand him kunt prays o my lord you are the maintainer of the entire universe and devotional service to you is the highest religious principle therefore i pray that you will also maintain me your transcendental form is covered by the yogamy the brahmajyoti is the covering of the internal potency may you kindly remove this glowing effulgence that impedes my seeing your saccidnandavigraha your eternal form of bliss and knowledge this yogamy curtain is also mentioned in the fifteenth chapter of the gt the supreme personality of godhead in his transcendental form of bliss and knowledge is covered by the eternal potency of brahmajyoti and the less intelligent impersonalists cannot see the supreme on this account also in the rmadbhgavatam 10147 there is this prayer by brahm o supreme personality of godhead o supersoul o master of all mystery who can calculate your potency and pastimes in this world you are always expanding your eternal potency and therefore no one can understand you learned scientists and learned scholars can examine the atomic constitution of the material world or even the planets but still they are unable to calculate your energy and potency although you are present before them the supreme personality of godhead lord ka is not only unborn but he is avyaya inexhaustible his eternal form is bliss and knowledge and his energies are all inexhaustible text 26 vedha samattni vartamnni crjuna bhaviyi ca

arjuna as the supreme personality of godhead i know everything that has happened in the past all that is happening in the present and all things that are yet to come i also know all living entities but me no one knows purport here the question of personality and impersonality is clearly stated if ka the form of the supreme personality of godhead is considered by the impersonalists to be my to be material then he would like the living entity change his body and forget everything in his past life anyone with a material body cannot remember his past life nor can he foretell his future life nor can he predict the outcome of his present life therefore he cannot know what is happening in past present and future unless one is liberated from material contamination he cannot know past present and future unlike the ordinary human being lord ka clearly says that he completely knows what happened in the past what is happening in the present and what will happen in the future in the fourth chapter we have seen that lord ka remembers instructing vivasvn the sungod millions of years ago ka knows every living entity because he is situated in every living beings heart as the supreme soul but despite his presence in every living entity as supersoul and his presence beyond the material sky as the supreme personality of godhead the less intelligent cannot realize him as the supreme person certainly the transcendental body of r ka is not perishable he is just like the sun and may is like the cloud in the material world we can see that there is the sun and that there are clouds and different stars and planets the clouds may cover all these in the sky temporarily but this covering is only apparent to our limited vision the sun moon and stars are not actually covered similarly my cannot cover the supreme lord by his internal potency he is not manifest to the less intelligent class of men as it is stated in the third verse of this chapter out of millions and millions of men some try to become perfect in this human form of life and out of thousands and thousands of such perfected men hardly one can understand what lord ka is even if one is perfected by realization of impersonal brahman or localized paramtm he cannot possibly understand the supreme personality of godhead r ka without being in ka consciousness text 27 icchdveasamutthena dvandvamohena bhrata

real constitutional position of the living entity is that of subordination to the supreme lord who is pure knowledge when one is deluded into separation from this pure knowledge he becomes controlled by illusory energy and cannot understand the supreme personality of godhead the illusory energy is manifested in the duality of desire and hate due to desire and hate the ignorant person wants to become one with the supreme lord and envies ka as the supreme personality of godhead pure devotees who are not so deluded or contaminated by desire and hate can understand that lord r ka appears by his internal potencies but those who are deluded by duality and nescience think that the supreme personality of godhead is created by material energies this is their misfortune such deluded persons symptomatically dwell in dualities of dishonor and honor misery and happiness woman and man good and bad pleasure and pain etc thinking this is my wife this is my house i am the master of this house i am the husband of this wife these are the dualities of delusion those who are so deluded by dualities are completely foolish and therefore cannot understand the supreme personality of godhead text 28

completely eradicated and who are freed from the duality of delusion engage themselves in my service with determination purport those eligible for elevation to the transcendental position are mentioned in this verse for those who are sinful atheistic foolish and deceitful it is very difficult to transcend the duality of desire and hate only those who have passed their lives in practicing the regulative principles of religion who have acted piously and have conquered sinful reactions can accept devotional service and gradually rise to the pure knowledge of the supreme personality of godhead then gradually they can meditate in trance on the supreme personality of godhead that is the process of being situated on the spiritual platform this elevation is possible in ka consciousness in the association of pure devotees who can deliver one from delusion it is stated in the rmadbhgavatam that if one actually wants to be liberated he must render service to the devotees but one who associates with materialistic people is on the path leading to the darkest region of existence all the devotees of the lord traverse this earth just to recover the conditioned souls from their delusion the impersonalists do not know that forgetting their constitutional position as subordinate to the supreme lord is the greatest violation of gods law unless one is reinstated in his own constitutional position it is not possible to understand the supreme personality or to be fully engaged in his transcendental loving service with determination text 29 jarmaraamokya mm ritya yatanti

affect this material body but not the spiritual body there is no birth death old age and disease for the spiritual body so one who attains a spiritual body becomes one of the associates of the supreme personality of godhead and engages in eternal devotional service is really liberated aha brahmsmi i am spirit it is said that one should understand that he is brahmanspirit soul this brahman conception of life is also in devotional service as described in this verse the pure devotees are transcendentally situated on the brahman platform and they know everything about transcendental and material activities four kinds of impure devotees who engage themselves in the transcendental service of the lord achieve their respective goals and by the grace of the supreme lord when they are fully ka conscious they actually enjoy spiritual association with the supreme lord but those who are worshipers of demigods never reach the supreme lord in his supreme planet even the less intelligent brahmanrealized persons cannot reach the supreme planet of ka known as goloka vndvana only persons who perform activities in ka consciousness mm rityaare actually entitled to be called brahman because they are actually endeavoring to reach the ka planet such persons have no misgivings about ka and thus they are factually brahman those who are engaged in worshiping the form or arc of the lord or who are engaged in meditation on the lord simply for liberation from material bondage also know by the grace of the lord the purports of brahman adhibhta etc as explained by the lord in the next chapter text 30 sdhib htdhidaiva m sdhiyaja ca ye vidu prayakle pi ca m te vidur yuktacetasa saadhibhtathe governing principle of the material manifestation adhidaivamunderlying all the demigods mmme

supreme lord as the governing principle of the material manifestation who know me as the one underlying all the demigods and as the one sustaining all sacrifices can with steadfast mind understand and know me even at the time of death purport persons acting in ka consciousness are never entirely deviated from the path of understanding the supreme personality of godhead in the transcendental association of ka consciousness one can understand how the supreme lord is the governing principle of the material manifestation and even of the demigods gradually by such transcendental association one becomes convinced of the supreme personality of godhead himself and at the time of death such a ka conscious person can never forget ka naturally he is thus promoted to the planet of the supreme lord goloka vndvana this seventh chapter particularly explains how one can become a fully ka conscious person the beginning of ka consciousness is association of persons who are ka conscious such association is spiritual and puts one directly in touch with the supreme lord and by his grace one can understand ka to be the supreme god at the same time one can really understand the constitutional position of the living entity and how the living entity forgets ka and becomes entangled in material activities by gradual development of ka consciousness in good association the living entity can understand that due to forgetfulness of ka he has become conditioned by the laws of material nature he can also understand that this human form of life is an opportunity to regain ka consciousness and that it should be fully utilized to attain the causeless mercy of the supreme lord many subjects have been discussed in this chapter the man in distress the inquisitive man the man in want of material necessities knowledge of brahman knowledge of paramtm liberation from birth death and diseases and worship of the supreme lord however he who is actually elevated in ka consciousness does not care for the different processes he simply directly engages himself in activities of ka consciousness and thereby factually attains his constitutional position as eternal servitor of lord ka in such a situation he takes pleasure in hearing and glorifying the supreme lord in pure devotional service he is convinced that by doing so all his objectives will be fulfilled this determined faith is called dhavrata and it is the beginning of bhaktiyoga or transcendental loving service that is the verdict of all scriptures this seventh chapter of the gt is the substance of that conviction thus end the bhaktivedanta purports to the seventh chapter of the rmadbhagavadgt in the matter of knowledge of the absolute bg8 chapter eight attaining the supreme text 1 arjuna uvca ki tadbrahma kim adhytma ki

self what are fruitive activities what is this material manifestation and what are the demigods please explain this to me purport in this chapter lord ka answers these different questions of arjuna beginning with what is brahman the lord also explains karma fruitive activities devotional service and yoga principles and devotional service in its pure form the rmad bhgavatam explains that the supreme absolute truth is known as brahman paramtm and bhagavn in addition the living entity individual soul is also called brahman arjuna also inquires about tm which refers to body soul and mind according to the vedic dictionary tm refers to the mind soul body and senses also arjuna has addressed the supreme lord as puruottama supreme person which means that he was putting these questions not simply to a friend but to the supreme person knowing him to be the supreme authority able to give definitive answers text 2 adhiyaja katha ko tra dehe smin madhusdana prayakle ca katha jeyo si

niyatatmabhiby the selfcontrolled translation how does this lord of sacrifice live in the body and in which part does he live o madhusdana and how can those engaged in devotional service know you at the time of death purport the lord of sacrifice accepts indra and viu viu is the chief of the primal demigods including brahm and iva and indra is the chief of the administrative demigods both indra and viu are worshiped by yaja performances but here arjuna asks who is actually the lord of yaja sacrifice and how is the lord residing within the body of the living entity arjuna addresses the lord as madhusdana because ka once killed a demon named madhu actually these questions which are of the nature of doubts should not have arisen in the mind of arjuna because arjuna is a ka conscious devotee therefore these doubts are like demons since ka is so expert in killing demons arjuna here addresses him as madhusdana so that ka might kill the demonic doubts that arise in arjunas mind now the word prayakle in this verse is very significant because whatever we do in life will be tested at the time of death arjuna fears that at the time of death those who are in ka consciousness will forget the supreme lord because at such a time body functions are disrupted and the mind may be in a panicstricken state therefore mahrja kulaekhara a great devotee prays my dear lord may i die immediately now that im healthy so that the swan of my mind may enter into the stem of thy lotus feet this metaphor is used because the swan often takes pleasure in entering the stem of the lotus flowersimilarly the mind of the pure devotee is drawn to the lotus feet of the lord mahrja kulaekhara fears that at the moment of death his throat will be so choked up that he will not be able to chant the holy names so it is better to die immediately arjuna questions how ones mind can remain fixed on kas lotus feet at such times text 3 r bhagavn uvca akara brahma parama svabhvo dhytmam ucyate

called bhtabhvaudbhavakaraaction producing the material bodies of the living entities visargacreation karmafruitive activities sajitais called translation the supreme lord said the indestructible transcendental living entity is called brahman and his eternal nature is called the self action pertaining to the development of these material bodies is called karma or fruitive activities purport brahman is indestructible and eternally existing and its constitution is not changed at any time but beyond brahman there is parabrahman brahman refers to the living entity and parabrahman refers to the supreme personality of godhead the constitutional position of the living entity is different from the position he takes in the material world in material consciousness his nature is to try to be the lord of matter but in spiritual ka consciousness his position is to serve the supreme when the living entity is in material consciousness he has to take on various bodies in the material world that is called karma or varied creation by the force of material consciousness in vedic literature the living entity is called jvtm and brahman but he is never called parabrahman the living entity jvtm takes different positionssometimes he merges into the dark material nature and identifies himself with matter and sometimes he identifies himself with the superior spiritual nature therefore he is called the supreme lords marginal energy according to his identification with material or spiritual nature he receives a material or spiritual body in material nature he may take a body from any of the 8400000 species of life but in spiritual nature he has only one body in material nature he is sometimes manifested as a man demigod an animal a beast bird etc according to his karma to attain material heavenly planets and enjoy their facilities he sometimes performs sacrifices yaja but when his merit is exhausted he returns to earth again in the form of a man in the process of sacrifice the living entity makes specific sacrifices to attain specific heavenly planets and consequently reaches them when the merit of sacrifice is exhausted then the living entity descends to earth in the form of rain then takes on the form of grains and the grains are eaten by man and transformed into semen which impregnates a woman and thus the living entity once again attains the human form to perform sacrifice and so repeat the same cycle in this way the living entity perpetually comes and goes on the material path the ka conscious person however avoids such sacrifices he takes directly to ka consciousness and thereby prepares himself to return to godhead impersonalist commentators on the gt unreasonably assume that brahman takes the form of jva in the material world and to substantiate this they refer to chapter fifteen verse 7 of the gt but this verse also speaks of the living entity as an eternal fragment of myself the fragment of god the living entity may fall down into the material world but the supreme lord acyuta never falls down therefore this assumption that the supreme brahman assumes the form of jva is not acceptable it is important to remember that in vedic literature brahman the living entity is distinguished from parabrahman the supreme lord text 4 adhibhta karo bhva purua cdhidaivatam adhiyajo ham evtra dehe dehabht vara adhibhtamthe physical

dehebody dehabhtm of the embodied varathe supreme translation physical nature is known to be endlessly mutable the universe is the cosmic form of the supreme lord and i am that lord represented as the supersoul dwelling in the heart of every embodied being purport the physical nature is constantly changing material bodies generally pass through six stages they are born they grow they remain for some duration they produce some byproducts they dwindle and then they vanish this physical nature is called adhibhtam because it is created at a certain point and will be annihilated at a certain point the conception of the universal form of the supreme lord that includes all the demigods and their different planets is called adhidaivatam the individual soul jva accompanies the body the supersoul a plenary representation of lord ka is called the paramtm or adhiyaja and is situated in the heart the word eva is particularly important in the context of this verse because by this word the lord stresses that the paramtm is not different from him the supersoul the supreme personality of godhead seated beside the individual soul is the witness of the individual souls activities and is the source of consciousness the supersoul gives the jva an opportunity to act freely and he witnesses his activities the functions of all these different manifestations of the supreme lord automatically become clarified for the pure ka conscious devotee engaged in transcendental service of the lord the gigantic universal form of the lord called adhidaivatam is contemplated by the neophyte who cannot approach the supreme lord in his manifestation as supersoul the neophyte is advised to contemplate the universal form whose legs are considered the lower planets and whose eyes are considered the sun and moon and whose head is considered the upper planetary system text 5 antakle ca mm eva smaran muktv kalevaram ya prayti sa madbhva yti nsty atra saaya antakleat the end of life

body in ka consciousness is at once transferred to the transcendental abode of the supreme lord the word smaran remembering is important remembrance of ka is not possible for the impure soul who has not practiced ka consciousness in devotional service to remember ka one should chant the mahmantra hare ka hare ka ka ka hare hare hare rma hare rma rma rma hare hare incessantly following in the footsteps of lord caitanya being more tolerant than the tree humbler than the grass and offering all respect to others without requiring respect in return in such a way one will be able to depart from

explained how can one die in the proper state of mind mahrja bharata thought of a deer at the time of death and so was transferred to that form of life however as a deer mahrja bharata could remember his past activities of course the cumulative effect of the thoughts and actions of ones life influences ones thoughts at the moment of death therefore the actions of this life determine ones future state of being if one is transcendentally absorbed in kas servicethen his next body will be transcendental spiritual not physical therefore the chanting of hare ka is the best process for successfully changing ones state of being to transcendental life text 7 tasmt sarveu kleu mm anusmara yudhya ca mayy arpitamano buddhir mm evaiyasy asaaya tasmttherefore sarveualways kleutime mmunto me anusmarago

of me in the form of ka and at the same time carry out your prescribed duty of fighting with your activities dedicated to me and your mind and intelligence fixed on me you will attain me without doubt purport this instruction to arjuna is very important for all men engaged in material activities the lord does not say that one should give up his prescribed duties or engagements one can continue them and at the same time think of ka by chanting hare ka this will free one from material contamination and engage the mind and intelligence in ka by chanting kas names one will be transferred to the supreme planet kaloka without a doubt text 8 abhysayogayuktena cetas nnyagmin parama purua divya yti prthnucintayan abhysapractice yogayuktenabeing engaged in meditation cetas by the mind and

meditates on the supreme personality of godhead his mind constantly engaged in remembering me undeviated from the path he o prtha arjuna is sure to reach me purport in this verse lord ka stresses the importance of remembering him ones memory of ka is revived by chanting the mahmantra hare ka by this practice of chanting and hearing the sound vibration of the supreme lord ones ear tongue and mind are engaged this mystic meditation is very easy to practice and it helps one attain the supreme lord puruam means enjoyer although living entities belong to the marginal energy of the supreme lord they are in material contamination they think themselves enjoyers but they are not the supreme enjoyer here it is clearly stated that the supreme enjoyer is the supreme personality of godhead in his different manifestations and plenary expansions as nryaa vsudeva etc the devotees can constantly think of the object of worship the supreme lord in any of his features nryaa ka rma etc by chanting hare ka this practice will purify him and at the end of his life due to his constant chanting he will be transferred to the kingdom of god yoga practice is meditation on the supersoul within similarly by chanting hare ka one fixes his mind always on the supreme lord the mind is fickle and therefore it is necessary to engage the mind by force to think of ka one example often given is that of the caterpillar that thinks of becoming a butterfly and so is transformed into a butterfly in the same life similarly if we constantly think of ka it is certain that at the end of our lives we shall have the same bodily constitution as ka text 9 kavi puram anusitram aor aysam anusmared ya sarvasya dhtram acintyarpam dityavara tamasa parastt kavimone who knows everything puramthe oldest anusitram the

nature purport the process of thinking of the supreme is mentioned in this verse the foremost point is that he is not impersonal or void one cannot meditate on something impersonal or void that is very difficult the process of thinking of ka however is very easy and is factually stated herein first of all he is purua spiritual rma and ka and is described herein as kavim that is he knows past present and future and therefore knows everything he is the oldest personality because he is the origin of everything everything is born out of him he is also the supreme controller of the universe maintainer and instructor of humanity he is smaller than the smallest the living entity is one 10000th part of the tip of a hair but the lord is so inconceivably small that he enters into the heart of this particle therefore he is called smaller than the smallest as the supreme he can enter into the atom and into the heart of the smallest and control him as the supersoul although so small he is still allpervading and is maintaining everything by him all these planetary systems are sustained we often wonder how these big planets are floating in the air it is stated here that the supreme lord by his inconceivable energy is sustaining all these big planets and systems of galaxies the word acintya inconceivable is very significant in this connection gods energy is beyond our conception beyond our thinking jurisdiction and is therefore called inconceivable acintya who can argue this point he pervades this material world and yet is beyond it we cannot even comprehend this material world which is insignificant compared to the spiritual worldso how can we comprehend what is beyond acintya means that which is beyond this material world that which our argument logic and philosophical speculation cannot touch that which is inconceivable therefore intelligent persons avoiding useless argument and speculation should accept what is stated in scriptures like the vedas gt and rmadbhgavatam and follow the principles they set down this will lead one to understanding text 10 prayakle manascalena bhakty yukto yogabalena caiva bhruvor madhye pram veya samyak sa ta para

translation one who at the time of death fixes his life air between the eyebrows and in full devotion engages himself in remembering the supreme lord will certainly attain to the supreme personality of godhead purport in this verse it is clearly stated that at the time of death the mind must be fixed in devotion on the supreme godhead for those practiced in yoga it is recommended that they raise the life force between the eyebrows but for a pure devotee who does not practice such yoga the mind should always be engaged in ka consciousness so that at death he can remember the supreme by his grace this is explained in verse fourteen the particular use of the word yogabalena is significant in this verse because without practice of yoga one cannot come to this transcendental state of being at the time of death one cannot suddenly remember the supreme lord at death unless he is practiced in some yoga system especially the system of bhaktiyoga since ones mind at death is very disturbed one should practice transcendence through yoga during ones life text 11 yad akara vedavido vadanti vianti yad yatayo vtarg yad icchanto brahmacarya caranti tat te pada sagrahea pravakye yatthat which

the renounced order enter into brahman desiring such perfection one practices celibacy i shall now explain to you this process by which one may attain salvation purport lord ka explains that brahman although one without a second has different manifestations and features for the impersonalists the syllable om is identical with brahman ka here explains the impersonal brahman in which the renounced order of sages enter in the vedic system of knowledge students from the very beginning are taught to vibrate om and learn of the ultimate impersonal brahman by living with the spiritual master in complete celibacy in this way they realize two of brahmans features this practice is very essential for the students advancement in spiritual life but at the moment such brahmacr unmarried celibate life is not at all possible the social construction of the world has changed so much that there is no possibility of ones practicing celibacy from the beginning of student life throughout the world there are many institutions for different departments of knowledge but there is no recognized institution where students can be educated in the brahmacr principles unless one practices celibacy advancement in spiritual life is very difficult therefore lord caitanya has announced according to the scriptural injunctions for this age of kali that no process of realizing the supreme is possible except the chanting of the holy name of lord ka hare ka hare ka ka ka hare hare hare rma hare rma rma rma hare hare text 12 sarvadvri sayamya mano hdi nirudhya ca mrdhny dhytmana pram sthito yogadhram

situation translation the yogic situation is that of detachment from all sensual engagements closing all the doors of the senses and fixing the mind on the heart and the life air at the top of the head one establishes himself in yoga purport to practice yoga as suggested here one first has to close the door of all sense enjoyment this practice is called pratyhra or withdrawing the senses from the sense objects sense organs for acquiring knowledge such as the eyes ears nose tongue and touch should be fully controlled and should not be allowed to engage in selfgratification in this way the mind focuses on the supersoul in the heart and the life force is raised to the top of the head in the sixth chapter this process is described in detail but as mentioned before this practice is not practical in this age the best process is ka consciousness if one is always able to fix his mind on ka in devotional service it is very easy for him to remain in an undisturbed transcendental trance or in samdhi text 13 o ity ekkara brahmavyharan mm anusmaran ya prayti tyajan deha sa yti param gatim omthe combination of letters omkra itithus ekaakaram supreme indestructible brahmaabsolute

practice and vibrating the sacred syllable om the supreme combination of letters if one thinks of the supreme personality of godhead and quits his body he will certainly reach the spiritual planets purport it is clearly stated here that om brahman and lord ka are not different the impersonal sound of ka is om but the sound hare ka contains om it is clearly recommended in this age that if one quits his body at the end of this life chanting the mahmantra hare ka he will reach the spiritual planets similarly those who are devotees of ka enter the ka planet or goloka vndvana whereas the impersonalists remain in the brahmajyoti the personalists also enter many innumerable planets in the spiritual sky known as vaikuhas text 14 ananyacet satata yo m smarati nityaa tasyha sulabha prtha

verse the bhaktiyoga of the unalloyed devotees of the supreme godhead is described the preceeding verses mention four different kinds of devoteesthe distressed the inquisitive those who seek material gain and the speculative philosophers different processes of liberation from material entanglement have also been described karmayoga jnayoga and hahayoga but here bhaktiyoga without any mixture of these is mentioned in bhaktiyoga the devotees desire nothing but ka the pure bhakti devotee does not desire promotion to heavenly planets nor does he seek salvation or liberation from material entanglement a pure devotee does not desire anything in the caitanyacaritmta the pure devotee is called nikma which means he has no desire for selfinterest perfect peace belongs to him alone not to them who strive for personal gain the pure devotee only wants to please the supreme lord and so the lord says that for anyone who is unflinchingly devoted to him he is easy to attain the devotee can render service to any of the transcendental forms of the supreme lord and he meets with none of the problems that plague the practitioners of other yogas bhaktiyoga is very simple and pure and easy to perform one can begin by simply chanting hare ka ka is very merciful to those who engage in his service and he helps in various ways that devotee who is fully surrendered to him so he can understand him as he is the lord gives such a devotee sufficient intelligence so that ultimately the devotee can attain him in his spiritual kingdom the special qualification of the pure devotee is that he is always thinking of ka without considering the time or place there should be no impediments he should be able to carry out his service anywhere and at any time some say that the devotee should remain in holy places like vndvana or some holy town where the lord lived but a pure devotee can live anywhere and create the atmosphere of vndvana by his devotional service it was r advaita who told lord caitanya wherever you are o lordthere is vndvana a pure devotee constantly remembers ka and meditates upon him these are qualifications of the pure devotee for whom the lord is most easily attainable bhaktiyoga is the system that the gt recommends above all others generally the bhaktiyogs are engaged in five different ways 1 ntabhakta engaged in devotional service in neutrality 2 dsyabhakta engaged in devotional service as servant 3 skhyabhakta engaged as friend 4 vtsalyabhakta engaged as parent and 5 mdhurya bhakta engaged as conjugal lover of the supreme lord in any of these ways the pure devotee is always constantly engaged in the transcendental loving service of the supreme lord and cannot forget the supreme lord and so for him the lord is easily attained a pure devotee cannot forget the supreme lord for a moment and similarly the supreme lord cannot forget his pure devotee for a moment this is the great blessing of the ka conscious process of chanting the mahmantra hare ka

perfection and attains the supreme planet kaloka goloka vndvana does not wish to return the supreme planet is described in vedic literature as beyond our material vision and it is considered the highest goal the mahtms great souls receive transcendental messages from the realized devotees and thus gradually develop devotional service in ka consciousness and become so absorbed in transcendental service that they no longer desire elevation to any of the material planets nor do they even want to be transferred to any spiritual planet they only want kas association and nothing else such great souls in ka consciousness attain the highest perfection of life in other words they are the supreme souls text 16 brahmabhuvanl lok punar vartino rjuna mm upetya tu kaunteya punar

elevated to higher planets people in higher planets such as brahmaloka candraloka and indraloka fall down to earth the practice of sacrifice called pacgnividy recommended in the kaha upaniad enables one to achieve brahmaloka but if in brahmaloka one does not cultivate ka consciousness then he must return to earth those who progress in ka consciousness in the higher planets are gradually elevated to higher and higher planets and at the time of universal devastation are transferred to the eternal spiritual kingdom when there is devastation of this material universe brahm and his devotees who

introduced and this yuga lasts 1296000 years in the dvparayuga there is an even greater decline in virtue and religion vice increasing and this yuga lasts 864000 years and finally in kaliyuga the yuga we have now been experiencing over the past 5000 years there is an abundance of strife ignorance irreligion and vice true virtue being practically nonexistent and this yuga lasts 432000 years in kaliyuga vice increases to such a point that at the termination of the yuga the supreme lord himself appears as the kalki avatra vanquishes the demons saves his devotees and commences another satyayuga then the process is set rolling again these four yugas rotating a thousand times comprise one day of brahm the creator god and the same number comprise one night brahm lives one hundred of such years and then dies these hundred years by earth calculations total to 311 trillion and 40 million earth years by these calculations the life of brahm seems fantastic and interminable but from the viewpoint of eternity it is as brief as a lightning flash in the causal ocean there are innumerable brahms rising and disappearing like bubbles in the atlantic brahm and his creation are all part of the material universe and therefore they are in constant flux in the material universe not even brahm is free from the process of birth old age disease and death brahm however is directly engaged in the service of the supreme lord in the management of this universe therefore he at once attains liberation elevated sannyss are promoted to brahms particular planet brahmaloka which is the highest

place where everything is full of spiritual bliss whatever variegatedness is manifest there is all of the quality of spiritual blissthere is nothing material all variegatedness is expanded as the spiritual expansion of the supreme godhead himself for the manifestation there is totally of the spiritual energy as explained in chapter seven as far as this material world is concerned although the lord is always in his supreme abode he is nonetheless allpervading by his material energy so by his spiritual and material energies he is present everywhereboth in the material and in the spiritual universes yasyntasthni means that everything is sustained by him whether it be spiritual or material energy it is clearly stated here that only by bhakti or devotional service can one enter into the vaikuha spiritual planetary system in all the vaikuhas there is only one supreme godhead ka who has expanded himself into millions and millions of plenary expansions these plenary expansions are

are not unalloyed devotees and who depend instead on such methods of spiritual realization as karmayoga jnayoga hahayoga etc must leave the body at a suitable time and thereby be assured whether or not they will return to the world of birth and death if the yog is perfect he can select the time and place for leaving this material world but if he is not so perfect then he has to leave at natures will the most suitable time to leave the body and not return is being explained by the lord in these verses according to crya baladeva vidybhaa the sanskrit word kla used herein refers to the presiding deity of time text 24 agnir jyotir aha ukla ams uttaryaam tatra prayt gacchanti brahma brahmavido jan agnifire jyotilight ahaday uklawhite amssix months uttaryaamwhen the sun passes on the

moon are mentioned it is to be understood that over all of them there are various presiding deities who make arrangements for the passage of the soul at the time of death the jva sets forth on the path to a new life if one leaves the body at the time designated above either accidently or by arrangement it is possible for him to attain the impersonal brahmajyoti mystics who are advanced in yoga practice can arrange the time and place to leave the body others have no controlif by accident they leave at an auspicious moment then they will not return to the cycle of birth and death but if not then there is every possibility that they will have to return however for the pure devotee in ka consciousness there is no fear of returning whether he leaves the body at an auspicious or inauspicious moment by accident or arrangement text 25 dhmo rtris tath ka ams dakiyanam tatra cndramasa jyotir yog prpya nivartate dhmasmoke rtrinight tathalso kathe fortnight of the dark moon amsthe six months

rmadbhgavatam we are informed that those who are expert in fruitive activities and sacrificial methods on earth attain to the moon at death these elevated souls live on the moon for about 10000 years by demigod calculations and enjoy life by drinking somarasa they eventually return to earth this means that on the moon there are higher classes of living beings though they may not be perceived by

the chandogya upaniad in such a way those who are fruitive laborers and philosophical speculators from time immemorial are constantly going and coming actually they do not attain ultimate salvation for they do not surrender to ka text 27 naite st prtha jnan yog muhyati kacana tasmt sarveu kleu yogayukto bhavrjuna nanever eteall these stdifferent paths prthao son of pth jnaneven if they know

know these two paths o arjuna are never bewildered therefore be always fixed in devotion purport ka is here advising arjuna that he should not be disturbed by the different paths the soul can take when leaving the material world a devotee of the supreme lord should not worry whether he will depart either by arrangement or by accident the devotee should be firmly established in kra consciousness and chant hare ka he should know that concern over either of these two paths is troublesome the best way to be absorbed in ka consciousness is to be always dovetailed in his service and this will make ones path to the spiritual kingdom safe certain and direct the word yogayukta is especially significant in this verse one who is firm in yoga is constantly engaged in ka consciousness in all his activities r rpa gosvm advises that one should be unattached in the material world and that all affairs should be steeped in ka consciousness in this way one attains perfection therefore the devotee is not disturbed by these descriptions because he knows that his passage to the supreme abode is guaranteed by devotional service text 28 vedeu yajeu tapasu caiva dneu yat puyaphala pradiam atyeti tat

sacrifices giving charity or pursuing philosophical and fruitive activities at the end he reaches the supreme abode purport this verse is the summation of the seventh and eighth chapters particularly as the chapters deal with ka consciousness and devotional service one has to study the vedas under the guidance of the spiritual master and undergo many austerities and penances while living under his care a brahmacr has to live in the home of the spiritual master just like a servant and he must beg alms from door to door and bring them to the spiritual master he takes food only under the masters order and if the master neglects to call the student for food that day the student fasts these are some of the vedic principles for observing brahmacarya after the student studies the vedas under the master for a period from five to twenty years he may become a man of perfect character study of the vedas isnot meant for the recreation of armchair speculators but for the formation of character after this training the brahmacr is allowed to enter into household life and marry when he is a householder he also has to perform many sacrifices and strive for further enlightenment then after retiring from household life upon accepting the order of vnaprastha he undergoes severe penances such as living in forests dressing with tree bark not shaving etc by carrying out the orders of brahmacr householder vnaprastha and finally sannysa one becomes elevated to the perfectional stage of life some are then elevated to the heavenly kingdoms and when they become even more advanced they are liberated in the spiritual sky either in the impersonal brahmajyoti or in the vaikuha planets or kaloka this is the path outlined by vedic literatures the beauty of ka consciousness however is that by one stroke by engaging in devotional service one can surpass all rituals of the different orders of life one should try to understand the seventh and eighth chapters of the gt not by scholarship or mental speculation but by hearing them in association with pure devotees chapters six through twelve are the essence of the gt if one is fortunate to understand the gtespecially these middle six chaptersin the association of devotees then his life at once becomes glorified beyond all penances sacrifices charities speculations etc one should hear the gt from the devotee because at the beginning of the fourth chapter it is stated that the gta can only be perfectly understood by devotees hearing the gt from devotees not from mental speculators is called faith through association of devotees one is placed in devotional service and by this service kas activities form pastimes name etc become clear and all misgivings are dispelled then once doubts are removed the study of the gt becomes extremely pleasurable and one develops a taste and feeling for ka consciousness in the advanced stage one falls completely in love with ka and that is the beginning of the highest perfectional stage of life which prepares the devotees transferral to kas abode in the spiritual sky goloka vndvana where the devotee enters into eternal happiness thus end the bhaktivedanta purports to the eighth chapter of the rmadbhagavadgt in the matter of attaining the supreme chapter nine the most confidential knowledge text 1 r bhagavn uvca ida tu te guhyatama pravakymy anasyave jna vijnasahita yaj jtv

knowledge sahitamwith yatwhich jtv knowing mokyasebe released aubhtfrom this miserable material existence translation the supreme lord said my dear arjuna because you are never envious of me i shall impart to you this most secret wisdom knowing which you shall be relieved of the miseries of material existence purport as a devotee hears more and more about the supreme lord he becomes enlightened this hearing process is recommended in the rmadbhgavatam the messages of the supreme personality of godhead are full of potencies and these potencies can be realized if topics regarding the supreme godhead are discussed amongst devotees this cannot be achieved by the association of mental speculators or academic scholars for it is realized knowledge the devotees are constantly engaged in the supreme lords service the lord understands the mentality and sincerity of a particular living entity who is engaged in ka consciousness and gives him the intelligence to understand the science of ka in the association of the devotees discussion of ka is very potent and if a fortunate person has such association and tries to assimilate the knowledge then he will surely make advancement toward spiritual realization lord ka in order to encourage arjuna to higher and higher elevation in his potent service describes in this ninth chapter matters more confidential than any he has already disclosed the very beginning of bhagavadgt the first chapter is more or less an introduction to the rest of the book and in the second and third chapters the spiritual knowledge described is called confidential topics discussed in the seventh and eighth chapters are specifically related to devotional service and because they bring enlightenment in ka consciousness they are called more confidential but the matters which are described in the ninth chapter deal with unalloyed pure devotion therefore this is called the most confidential one who is situated in the most confidential knowledge of ka is naturally transcendental he therefore has no material pangs although he is in the material world in the bhaktirasmtasindhu it is said that although one who has a sincere desire to render loving service to the supreme lord is situated in the conditional state of material existence he is to be considered liberated similarly we shall find in the bhagavadgt tenth chapter that anyone who is engaged in that way is a liberated person now this first verse has specific significance knowledge ida jnam refers to pure devotional service which consists of nine different activities hearing chanting remembering serving worshiping praying obeying maintaining friendship and surrendering everything by the practice of these nine elements of devotional service one is elevated to spiritual consciousness ka consciousness at the time when ones heart is cleared of the material contamination one can understand this science of ka simply to understand that a living entity is not material is not sufficient that may be the beginning of spiritual realization but one should recognize the difference between activities of the body and spiritual activities by which one understands that he is not the body in the seventh chapter we have already discussed the opulent potency of the supreme personality of godhead his different energies the inferior and superior natures and all this material manifestation now in chapters nine and ten the glories of the lord will be delineated the sanskrit word anasyave in this verse is also very significant generally the commentators even if they are highly scholarly are all envious of ka the supreme personality of godhead even the most erudite scholars write on bhagavadgt very inaccurately because they are envious of ka their commentaries are useless the commentaries given by devotees of the lord are bona fide no one can explain bhagavadgt or give perfect knowledge of ka if he is envious one who criticizes the character of ka without knowing him is a fool so such commentaries should be very carefully avoided for one who understands that ka is the supreme personality of godhead the pure and transcendental personality these chapters will be very beneficial text 2 rjavidy rjaguhya pavitram idam uttamam pratyakvagama dharmya susukha kartum avyayam rjavidythe king of education rjaguhyamthe king of confidential knowledge pavitramthe purest idamthis uttamam transcendental pratyakadirectly experienced avagamamunderstood dharmyamthe principle of religion susukhamvery happy kartumto execute avyayam everlasting translation this knowledge is the king of education the most secret of all secrets it is the purest knowledge and because it gives direct perception of the self by realization it is the perfection of religion it is everlasting and it is joyfully performed purport this chapter of bhagavadgt is called the king of education because it is the essence of all doctrines and philosophies explained before there are seven principal philosophers in india gautama kada kapila yjavalkya ilya vaivnara and finally vysadeva the author of the vedntastra so there is no dearth of knowledge in the field of philosophy or transcendental knowledge now the lord says that this ninth chapter is the king of all such knowledge the essence of all knowledge that can be derived from the study of the vedas and different kinds of philosophy it is the most confidential because confidential or transcendental knowledge involves understanding the difference between the soul and the body and the king of all confidential knowledge culminates in devotional service generally people are not educated in this confidential knowledge they are educated in external knowledge as far as ordinary education is concerned people are involved with so many departments politics sociology physics chemistry mathematics astronomy engineering etc there are so many departments of knowledge all over the world and many huge universities but there is unfortunately no university or educational institution where the science of the spirit soul is instructed yet the soul is the most important part of this body without the presence of the soul the body has no value still people are placing great stress on the bodily necessities of life not caring for the vital soul the bhagavadgt especially from the second chapter on stresses the importance of the soul in the very beginning the lord says that this body is perishable and that the soul is not perishable that is a confidential part of knowledge simply knowing that spirit soul is different from this body and that its nature is immutable indestructible and eternal but that gives no positive information about the soul sometimes people are under the impression that the soul is different from the body and that when the body is finished or one is liberated from the body the soul remains in a void and becomes impersonal but actually that is not the fact how can the soul which is so active within this body be inactive after being liberated from the body it is always active if it is eternal then it is eternally active and its activities in the spiritual kingdom are the most confidential part of spiritual knowledge these activities of the spirit soul are therefore indicated here as constituting the king of all knowledge the most confidential part of all knowledge this knowledge is the purest form of all activities as is explained in vedic literature in the padma pura mans sinful activities have been analyzed and are shown to be the results of sin after sin those who are engaged in fruitive activities are entangled in different stages and forms of sinful reactions for instance when the seed of a particular tree is sown the tree does not appear immediately to grow it takes some time it is first a small sprouting plant then it assumes the form of a tree then it flowers bears fruit and when it is complete the flowers and fruits are enjoyed by persons who have sown the seed of the tree similarly a man performs a sinful act and like a seed it takes time to fructify there are different stages the sinful action may have already stopped within the individual but the results or the fruit of that sinful action are still enjoyed there are sins which are still in the form of a seed and there are others which are already fructified and are giving us fruit which we are enjoying as distress and pain as explained in the twentieth verse of the seventh chapter a person who has completely ended the reactions of all sinful activities and who is fully engaged in pious activities being freed from the duality of this material world becomes engaged in devotional service to the supreme personality of godhead ka in other words those who are actually engaged in the devotional service of the supreme lord are already freed from all reactions for those who are engaged in the devotional service of the supreme personality of godhead all sinful reactions whether fructified in the stock or in the form of a seed gradually vanish therefore the purifying potency of devotional service is very strong and it is called pavitram uttamam the purest uttamam means transcendental tamas means this material world or darkness and uttamam means that which is transcendental to material activities devotional activities are never to be considered material although sometimes it appears that devotees are engaged just like ordinary men one who can see and is familiar with devotional service however will know that they are not material activities they are all spiritual and devotional uncontaminated by the material modes of nature it is said that the execution of devotional service is so perfect that one can perceive the results directly this direct result is actually perceived and we have practical experience that any person who is chanting the holy names of ka hare ka hare ka ka ka hare hare hare rma hare rma rma rma hare hare in course of time feels some transcendental pleasure and very quickly becomes purified of all material contamination this is actually seen furthermore if one engages not only in hearing but in trying to broadcast the message of devotional activities as well or if he engages himself in helping the missionary activities of ka consciousness he gradually feels spiritual progress this advancement in spiritual life does not depend on any kind of previous education or qualification the method itself is so pure that by simply engaging in it one becomes pure in the vedntastra this is also described in the following words praka ca karmay abhyst devotional service is so potent that simply by engaging in the activities of devotional service one becomes enlightened without a doubt nrada who happened to be the son of a maidservant had no education nor was he born into a high family but when his mother was engaged in serving great devotees nrada also became engaged and sometimes in the absence of his mother he would serve the great devotees himself nrada personally says once only by their permission i took the remnants of their food and by so doing all my sins were at once eradicated thus being engaged i became purified in heart and at that time the very nature of the transcendentalist became attractive to me bhg 1525 nrada tells his disciple vysadeva that in a previous life he was engaged as a boy servant of purified devotees during four months of their stay and that he was intimately associating with them sometimes those sages left remnants of food on their dishes and the boy who would wash their dishes wanted to taste the remnants so he asked the great devotees whether he could eat them and they gave their permission nrada then ate those remnants and consequently became freed from all sinful reactions as he went on eating he gradually became as purehearted as the sages and he gradually developed the same taste the great devotees relished the taste of unceasing devotional service of the lord hearing chanting etc and by developing the same taste nrada wanted also to hear and chant the glories of the lord thus by associating with the sages he developed a great desire for devotional service therefore he quotes from the vedntastra praka ca karmay abhyst if one is engaged simply in the acts of devotional service everything is revealed to him automatically and he can understand this is called praka directly perceived nrada was actually a son of a maidservant he had no opportunity to go to school he was simply assisting his mother and fortunately his mother rendered some service to the devotees the child nrada also got the opportunity and simply by association achieved the highest goal of all religions devotional service in the rmadbhgavatam it is said that religious people generally do not know that the highest perfection of religion is the attainment of the stage of devotional service generally vedic knowledge is required for the understanding of the path of selfrealization but here although he was not educated in the vedic principle nrada acquired the highest results of vedic study this process is so potent that even without performing the religious process regularly one can be raised to the highest perfection how is this possible this is also confirmed in vedic literature cryavn puruo veda one who is in association with great cryas even if he is not educated or has not studied the vedas can become familiar with all the knowledge necessary for realization the process of devotional service is a very happy one why devotional service consists of ravaa krtana vio so one can simply hear the chanting of the glories of the lord or can attend philosophical lectures on transcendental knowledge given by authorized cryas simply by sitting one can learn then one can eat the remnants of the food offered to god nice palatable dishes in every state devotional service is joyful one can execute devotional service even in the most povertystricken condition the lord says patra pupa phalam he is ready to accept from the devotee any kind of offering never mind what even a leaf a flower a bit of fruit or a little water which are all available in every part of the world can be offered by any person regardless of social position and will be accepted if offered with love there are many instances in history simply by tasting the tulas leaves offered to the lotus feet of the lord great sages like sanatkumra became great devotees therefore the devotional process is very nice and it can be executed in a happy mood god accepts only the love with which things are offered to him it is said here that this devotional service is eternally existing it is not as the myvd philosophers claim they sometimes take to socalled devotional service and as long as they are not liberated they continue their devotional service but at the end when they become liberated they become one with god such temporary timeserving devotional service is not accepted as pure devotional service actual devotional service continues even after liberation when the devotee goes to the spiritual planet in the kingdom of god he is also engaged there in serving the supreme lord he does not try to become one with the supreme lord as it will be seen actual devotional service begins after liberation so in bhagavadgt it is said brahmabhta after being liberated or being situated in the brahman position ones devotional service begins by executing devotional service one can understand the supreme lord no one can understand the supreme personality of godhead by executing karmayoga jna or agayoga or any other yoga independently without coming to the stage of devotional service one cannot understand what is the personality of godhead in the rmadbhgavatam it is also confirmed that when one becomes purified by executing the process of devotional service especially by hearing rmadbhgavatam or bhagavadgt from realized souls then he can understand the science of ka or the science of god eva prasannamanaso bhagavadbhaktiyogata when ones heart is cleared of all nonsense then one can understand what god is thus the process of devotional service of ka consciousness is the king of all education and the king of all confidential knowledge it is the purest form of religion and it can be executed joyfully without difficulty therefore one should adopt it

attain me o conqueror of foes but return to birth and death in this material world purport the faithless cannot accomplish this process of devotional service that is the purport of this verse faith is created by association with devotees unfortunate people even after hearing all the evidence of vedic literature from great personalities still have no faith in god they are hesitant and cannot stay fixed in the devotional service of the lord thus faith is a most important factor for progress in ka consciousness in the caitanyacaritmta it is said that one should have complete conviction that simply by serving the supreme lord r ka he can achieve all perfection that is called real faith in the rmadbhgavatam 3412 it is stated that by giving water to the root of a tree its branches twigs and leaves become satisfied and by supplying food to the stomach all the senses of the body become satisfied and similarly by engaging in the transcendental service of the supreme lord all the demigods and all the living entities automatically become satisfied after reading bhagavadgt one should promptly come to the conclusion of bhagavadgt one should give up all other engagements and adopt the service of the supreme lord ka the personality of godhead if one is convinced of this philosophy of life that is faith now the development of that faith is the process of ka consciousness there are three divisions of ka conscious men in the third class are those who have no faith if they are engaged in devotional service officially for some ulterior purpose they cannot achieve the highest perfectional stage most probably they will slip after some time they may become engaged but because they havent complete conviction and faith it is very difficult for them to continue in ka consciousness we have practical experience in discharging our missionary activity that some people come and apply themselves to the ka consciousness with some hidden motive and as soon as they are economically a little wellsituated they give up this process and take to their old ways again it is only by faith that one can advance in ka consciousness as far as the development of faith is concerned one who is well versed in the literatures of devotional service and has attained the stage of firm faith is called a firstclass person in ka consciousness and in the second class are those who are not very advanced in understanding the devotional scriptures but who automatically have firm faith that ka bhakti or service to ka is the best course and so in good faith have taken it up thus they are superior to the third class who have neither perfect knowledge of the scriptures nor good faith but by association and simplicity are trying to follow the thirdclass person in ka consciousness may fall down but when one is in the second class or first class he does not fall down one in the first class will surely make progress and achieve the result at the end as far as the thirdclass person in ka consciousness is concerned although he has faith in the conviction that devotional service to ka is very good he has no knowledge of ka through the scriptures like rmadbhgavatam and bhagavadgt sometimes these thirdclass persons in ka consciousness have some tendency toward karmayoga and jnayoga and sometimes they are disturbed but as soon as the infection of karmayoga or jnayoga is vanquished they become secondclass or firstclass persons in ka consciousness faith in ka is also divided into three stages and described in rmadbhgavatam firstclass attachment secondclass attachment and thirdclass attachment are also explained in rmad bhgavatam in the eleventh canto those who have no faith even after hearing about ka and the excellence of devotional service who think that it is simply eulogy find the path very difficult even if they are supposedly engaged in devotional service for them there is very little hope in gaining perfection thus faith is very important in the discharge of devotional service text 4 may tatam ida sarva jagad avyaktamrtin matsthni sarvabhtni na cha tev avasthita mayby me tatamspread idamall these manifestations sarvam all

entire universe is pervaded all beings are in me but i am not in them purport the supreme personality of godhead is not perceivable through the gross material senses it is said that lord r kas name fame pastimes etc cannot be understood by material senses only to one who is engaged in pure devotional service under proper guidance is he revealed in the brahmasahit it is stated premjanacchurita one can see the supreme personality of godhead govinda always within himself and outside himself if he has developed the transcendental loving attitude towards him thus for people in general he is not visible here it is said that although he is allpervading everywhere present he is yet not conceivable by the material senses but actually although we cannot see him everything is resting in him as we have discussed in the seventh chapter the entire material cosmic manifestation is only a combination of his two different energies the superior spiritual energy and the inferior material energy just as the sunshine is spread all over the universe the energy of the lord is spread all over the creation and everything is resting in that energy yet one should not conclude that because he is spread all over he has lost his personal existence to refute such argument the lord says i am everywhere and everything is in me but still i am aloof for example a king heads a government which is but the manifestation of the kings energy the different governmental departments are nothing but the energies of the king and each department is resting on the kings power but still one cannot expect the king to be present in every department personally that is a crude example similarly all the manifestations that we see and everything that exists both in this material world and in the spiritual world are resting on the energy of the supreme personality of godhead the creation takes place by the diffusion of his different energies and as is stated in the bhagavadgt he is everywhere present by his personal representation the diffusion of his different energies text 5 na ca matsthni bhtni paya me yogam aivaram bhtabhn na ca bhtastho mamtm bhtabhvana nanever caalso matsthnisituated in me bhtniall

all manifestations translation and yet everything that is created does not rest in me behold my mystic opulence although i am the maintainer of all living entities and although i am everywhere still my self is the very source of creation purport the lord says that everything is resting on him this should not be misunderstood the lord is not directly concerned with the maintenance and sustenance of this material manifestation sometimes we see a picture of atlas holding the globe on his shoulders he seems to be very tired holding this great earthly planet such an image should not be entertained in connection with kas upholding this created universe he says that although everything is resting on him still he is aloof the planetary systems are floating in space and this space is the energy of the supreme lord but he is different from space he is differently situated therefore the lord says although they are situated on my inconceivable energy still as the supreme personality of godhead i am aloof from them this is the inconceivable opulence of the lord in the vedic dictionary it is said the supreme lord is performing inconceivably wonderful pastimes displaying his energy his person is full of different potent energies and his determination is itself actual fact in this way the personality of godhead is to be understood we may think to do something but there are so many impediments and sometimes it is not possible to do as we like but when ka wants to do something simply by his willing everything is performed so perfectly that one cannot imagine how it is being done the lord explains this fact although he is the maintainer and sustainer of all material manifestation he does not touch this material manifestation simply by his supreme will everything is created everything is sustained everything is maintained and everything is annihilated there is no difference between his mind and himself as there is a difference between ourselves and our present material mind because he is absolute spirit simultaneously the lord is present in everything yet the common man cannot understand how he is also present personally he is different from this material manifestation yet everything is resting on him this is explained here as yogam aivaram the mystic power of the supreme personality of godhead text 6 yathkasthito nitya vyu sarvatrago mahn tath sarvi

me itithus upadhrayatry to understand translation as the mighty wind blowing everywhere always rests in ethereal space know that in the same manner all beings rest in me purport for the ordinary person it is almost inconceivable how the huge material creation is resting in him but the lord is giving an example which may help us to understand space is the biggest manifestation we can conceive the cosmic manifestation rests in space space permits the movement of even the atoms and on up to the greatest planets the sun and the moon although the sky or wind or air is great still it is situated within space space is not beyond the sky similarly all the wonderful cosmic manifestations are existing by the supreme will of god and all of them are subordinate to that supreme will as we generally say not a blade of grass moves without the will of the supreme personality of godhead thus everything is moving under his will by his will everything is being created everything is being maintained and everything is being annihilated still he is aloof from everything as space is always aloof from the activities of the atmosphere in the upaniads it is stated it is out of the fear of the supreme lord that the wind is blowing in the garga upaniad also it is stated by the supreme order under the superintendence of the supreme personality of godhead the moon the sun and the great planets are moving in the brahmasahit this is also stated there is also a description of the movement of the sun and it is said that the sun is considered to be one of the eyes of the supreme lord and that it has immense potency to diffuse heat and light still it is moving in its prescribed orbit by the order and the supreme will of govinda so from the vedic literature we can find evidence that this material manifestation which appears to us to be very wonderful and great is under the complete control of the supreme personality of godhead this will be further explained in the later verses of this chapter text 7 sarvabhtni kaunteya prakti ynti mmikm kalpakaye punas tni kalpdau visjmy aham sarvabhtniall created entities kaunteyao son of kunt praktim nature yntienter mmikmunto me kalpakayeat the end of the millennium punaagain tniall those kalpadauin the beginning of the millennium visjmii create ahami translation o son of kunt at the end of the millennium every material manifestation enters into my nature and at the beginning of another millennium by my potency i again create purport the creation maintenance and annihilation of this material cosmic manifestation is completely dependent on the supreme will of the personality of godhead at the end of the millennium means at the death of brahm brahm lives for one hundred years and his one day is calculated at 4300000000 of our earthly years his night is of the same duration his month consists of thirty such days and nights and his year of twelve months after one hundred such years when brahm dies the devastation or annihilation takes place this means that the energy manifested by the supreme lord is again wound up in himself then again when there is need to manifest the cosmic world it is done by his will although i am one i shall become many this is the vedic aphorism he expands himself in this material energy and the whole cosmic manifestation again takes place text 8 prakti svm avaabhya visjmi puna

ktsnamtotal avaam automatically prakteby the force of nature vatunder obligation translation the whole cosmic order is under me by my will it is manifested again and again and by my will it is annihilated at the end purport this matter is the manifestation of the inferior energy of the supreme personality of godhead this has already been explained several times at the creation the material energy is let loose as mahattattva into which the lord as his first purua incarnation mahviu enters he lies within the causal ocean and breathes out innumerable universes and into each universe the lord again enters as garbhodakay viu each universe is in that way created he still further manifests himself as krodakay viu and that viu enters into everythingeven into the minute atom this fact is explained here he enters into everything now as far as the living entities are concerned they are impregnated into this material nature and as a result of their past deeds they take different positions thus the activities of this material world begin the activities of the different species of living beings are begun from the very moment of the creation it is not that all is evolved the different species of life are created immediately along with the universe men animals beasts birdseverything is simultaneously created because whatever desires the living entities had at the last annihilation are again manifested it is clearly stated here that the living entities have nothing to do with this process the state of being in their past life in the past creation is simply manifested again and all this is done simply by his will this is the inconceivable potency of the supreme personality of god and after creating different species of life he has no connection with them the creation takes place to accommodate the inclinations of the various living entities and so the lord does not become involved with it text 9 na ca m tni karmi nibadhnanti dhanajaya udsnavad snam

activities translation o dhanajaya all this work cannot bind me i am ever detached seated as though neutral purport one should not think in this connection that the supreme personality of godhead has no engagement in his spiritual world he is always engaged in the brahmasahit it is stated he is always involved in his eternal blissful spiritual activities but he has nothing to do with these material activities material activities are being carried on by his different potencies the lord is always neutral in the material activities of the created world this neutrality is explained here although he has control over every minute detail of matter he is sitting as if neutral the example can be given of a high court judge sitting on his bench by his order so many things are happening someone is being hanged someone is being put into jail someone is awarded a huge amount of wealthbut still he is neutral he has nothing to do with all that gain and loss similarly the lord is always neutral although he has his hand in every sphere of activity in the vedntastra it is stated that he is not situated in the dualities of this material world he is transcendental to these dualities nor is he attached to the creation and annihilation of this material world the living entities take their different forms in the various species of life according to their past deeds and the lord doesnt interfere with them text 10 maydhyakea prakti syate sacarcaram hetunnena kaunteya jagad viparivartate mayby me adhyakeaby superintendence praktimaterial nature syatemanifest sawith carcarammoving and nonmoving hetunfor this reason anenathis kaunteyao son of kunt jagat the cosmic manifestation viparivartateis working translation this material nature is working under my direction o son of kunt and it is producing all moving and unmoving beings by its rule this manifestation is created and annihilated again and again purport it is clearly stated here that the supreme lord although aloof from all the activities of the material world remains the supreme director the supreme lord is the supreme will and the background of this material manifestation but the management is being conducted by material nature ka also states in bhagavadgt that of all the living entities in different forms and species i am the father the father gives seeds to the womb of the mother for the child and similarly the supreme lord by his mere glance injects all the living entities into the womb of material nature and they come out in their different forms and species according to their last desires and activities all these living entities although born under the glance of the supreme lord still take their different bodies according to their past deeds and desires so the lord is not directly attached to this material creation he simply glances over material nature material nature is thus activated and everything is created immediately because he glances over material nature there is undoubtedly activity on the part of the supreme lord but he has nothing to do with the manifestation of the material world directly this example is given in the smti when there is a fragrant flower before someone the fragrance is touched by the smelling power of the person yet the smelling and the flower are detached from one another there is a similar connection between the material world and the supreme personality of godhead actually he has nothing to do with this material world but he creates by his glance and ordains in summary material nature without the superintendence of the supreme personality of godhead cannot do anything yet the supreme personality is detached from all material activities text 11 avajnanti m mh mnu tanum ritam para bhvam ajnanto mama bhtamahevaram avajnantideride mmme

when i descend in the human form they do not know my transcendental nature and my supreme dominion over all that be purport from the other explanations of the previous verses in this chapter it is clear that the supreme personality of godhead although appearing like a human being is not a common man the personality of godhead who conducts the creation maintenance and annihilation of the complete cosmic manifestation cannot be a human being yet there are many foolish men who consider ka to be merely a powerful man and nothing more actually he is the original supreme personality as is confirmed in the brahmasahit ivara parama ksa he is the supreme lord there are many varas controllers and one appears greater than another in the ordinary management of affairs in the material world we find some official or director and above him there is a secretary and above him a minister and above him a president each of them is a controller but one is controlled by another in the brahmasahit it is said that ka is the supreme controller there are many controllers undoubtedly both in the material and spiritual world but ka is the supreme controller vara parama ka and his body is saccidnanda nonmaterial material bodies cannot perform the wonderful acts described in previous verses his body is eternal blissful and full of knowledge although he is not a common man the foolish deride him and consider him to be a man his body is called here mnum because he is acting just like a man a friend of arjunas a politician involved in the battle of kuruketra in so many ways he is acting just like an ordinary man but actually his body is saccidnandavigrahaeternal bliss and knowledge absolute this is confirmed in the vedic language also saccidnandarpya kya i offer my obeisances unto the supreme personality of godhead ka who is the eternal blissful form of knowledge there are other descriptions in the vedic language also tam eka govindam you are govinda the pleasure of the senses and the cows saccidnanda vigraham and your form is transcendental full of knowledge bliss and eternality despite the transcendental qualities of lord kas body its full bliss and knowledge there are many socalled scholars and commentators of bhagavadgt who deride ka as an ordinary man the scholar may be born an extraordinary man due to his previous good work but this conception of r ka is due to a poor fund of knowledge therefore he is called mha for only foolish persons consider ka to be an ordinary human being because they do not know the confidential activities of the supreme lord and his different energies they do not know that kas body is a symbol of complete knowledge and bliss that he is the proprietor of everything that be and that he can award liberation to anyone because they do not know that ka has so many transcendental qualifications they deride him nor do they know that the appearance of the supreme personality of godhead in this material world is a manifestation of his internal energy he is the master of the material energy as has been explained in several places mama my duratyay he claims that the material energy although very powerful is under his control and whoever surrenders unto him can get out of the control of this material energy if a soul surrendered to ka can get out of the influence of material energy then how can the supreme lord who conducts the creation maintenance and annihilation of the whole cosmic nature have a material body like us so this conception of ka is complete foolishness foolish persons however cannot conceive that the personality of godhead ka appearing just like an ordinary man can be the controller of all the atoms and of the gigantic manifestation of the universal form the biggest and the minutest are beyond their conception so they cannot imagine that a form like that of a human being can simultaneously control the infinite and the minute actually although he is controlling the infinite and the finite he is apart from all this manifestation it is clearly stated concerning his yogam aivaram his inconceivable transcendental energy that he can control the infinite and the finite simultaneously and that he can remain aloof from them although the foolish cannot imagine how ka who appears just like a human being can control the infinite and the finite those who are pure devotees accept this for they know that ka is the supreme personality of godhead therefore they completely surrender unto him and engage in ka consciousness devotional service of the lord there are many controversies amongst the impersonalists and the personalists about the lords appearance as a human being but if we consult bhagavadgt and rmad bhgavatam the authoritative texts for understanding the science of ka then we can understand that ka is the supreme personality of godhead he is not an ordinary man although he appeared on this earth as an ordinary human in the rmadbhgavatam first canto first chapter when the sages inquire about the activities of ka it is stated that his appearance as a man bewilders the foolish no human being could perform the wonderful acts that ka performed while he was present on this earth when ka appeared before his father and mother vasudeva and devak he appeared with four hands but after the prayers of the parents he transformed himself into an ordinary child his appearance as an ordinary human being is one of the features of his transcendental body in the eleventh chapter of the gt also it is stated tenaiva rpea etc arjuna prayed to see again that form of four hands and when ka was thus petitioned by arjuna he again assumed his original form all these different features of the supreme lord are certainly not those of an ordinary human being some of those who deride ka who are infected with the myvd philosophy quote the following verse from the rmadbhgavatam to prove that ka is just an ordinary man aha sarveu bhteu bhttmvasthita sad the supreme is present in every living entity bhg 32921we should better take note of this particular verse from the vaiava cryas like jva gosvm instead of following the interpretation of unauthorized persons who deride ka jva gosvm commenting on this verse says that ka in his plenary expansion as paramtm is situated in the moving and the nonmoving entities as the supersoul so any neophyte devotee who simply gives his attention to the arcamrti the form of the supreme lord in the temple and does not respect other living entities is uselessly worshiping the form of the lord in the temple there are three kinds of devotees of the lord and the neophyte is in the lowest stage the neophyte devotee gives more attention to the deity in the temple than to other devotees so jva gosvm warns that this sort of mentality should be corrected a devotee should see that ka is present in everyones heart as paramtm therefore every body is the embodiment or the temple of the supreme lord and as such as one offers respect to the temple of the lord he should similarly properly respect each and every body in whom the paramtm dwells everyone should therefore be given proper respect and should not be neglected there are also many impersonalists who deride temple worship they say that since god is everywhere why should one restrict himself to temple worship but if god is everywhere is he not in the temple or in the deity although the personalist and the impersonalist will fight with one another perpetually a perfect devotee in ka consciousness knows that although ka is the supreme personality he is allpervading as is confirmed in the brahmasahit although his personal abode is goloka vndvana and he is always staying there still by his different manifestations of energy and by his plenary expansion he is present everywhere in all parts of the material and spiritual creation text 12 mogh moghakarmo moghajn vicetasa rkasm sur caiva prakti mohin rit moghbaffled hope moghakarmabaffled in fruitive activities moghajnbaffled in knowledge vicetasabewildered rkasm demonic surmatheistic caand evacertainly praktim nature mohinmbewildering rittaking shelter of translation those who are thus bewildered are attracted by demonic and atheistic views in that deluded condition their hopes for liberation their fruitive activities and their culture of knowledge are all defeated purport there are many devotees who assume themselves to be in ka consciousness and devotional service but at heart do not accept the supreme personality of godhead ka as the absolute truth for them the fruit of devotional servicegoing back to godheadwill never be tasted similarly those who are engaged in fruitive pious activities and who are ultimately hoping to be liberated from this material entanglement will never be successful either because they deride the supreme personality of godhead ka in other words persons who mock ka are to be understood to be demonic or atheistic as described in the seventh chapter of bhagavadgt such demonic miscreants never surrender to ka therefore their mental speculations to arrive at the absolute truth bring them to the false conclusion that the ordinary living entity and ka are one and the same with such a false conviction they think that the body of any human being is now simply covered by material nature and that as soon as one is liberated from this material body there is no difference between god and himself this attempt to become one with ka will be baffled because of delusion such atheistic and demoniac cultivation of spiritual knowledge is always futile that is the indication of this verse for such persons cultivation of the knowledge in the vedic literature like the vedntastra and the upaniads is always baffled it is a great offense therefore to consider ka the supreme personality of godhead to be an ordinary man those who do so are certainly deluded because they cannot understand the eternal form of ka in the bhadvaiava mantra it is clearly stated that one who considers the body of ka to be material should be driven out from all rituals and activities of the ruti and if one by chance sees his face he should at once take bath in the ganges to rid himself of infection people jeer at ka because they are envious of the supreme personality of godhead their destiny is certainly to take birth after birth in the species of atheistic and demoniac life perpetually their real knowledge will remain under delusion and gradually they will regress to the darkest region of creation text 13 mahtmnas tu m prtha daiv praktim rit bhajanty

jtv knowing bhtacreation dimoriginal avyayam inexhaustible translation o son of pth those who are not deluded the great souls are under the protection of the divine nature they are fully engaged in devotional service because they know me as the supreme personality of godhead original and inexhaustible purport in this verse the description of mahtm is clearly given the first sign of the mahtm is that he is already situated in the divine nature he is not under the control of material nature and how is this effected that is explained in the seventh chapter one who surrenders unto the supreme personality of godhead r ka at once becomes freed from the control of material nature that is the qualification one can become free from the control of material nature as soon as he surrenders his soul to the supreme personality of godhead that is the preliminary formula being marginal potency as soon as the living entity is freed from the control of material nature he is put under the guidance of the spiritual nature the guidance of the spiritual nature is called daiv praktim divine nature so when one is promoted in that wayby surrendering to the supreme personality of godheadone attains to the stage of great soul mahtm the mahtm does not divert his attention to anything outside ka because he knows perfectly well that ka is the original supreme person the cause of all causes there is no doubt about it such a mahtm or great soul develops through association with other mahtms pure devotees pure devotees are not even attracted by kas other features such as the fourarmed mahviu they are simply attracted by the two armed form of ka since they are not attracted to other features of ka what to speak of the demigods they are not concerned with any form of a demigod or of a human being they only meditate upon ka in ka consciousness they are always engaged in the unswerving service of the lord in ka consciousness text 14 satata krtayanto m yatanta ca dhavrat namasyanta ca m bhakty

engaged upsateworship translation always chanting my glories endeavoring with great determination bowing down before me these great souls perpetually worship me with devotion purport the mahtm cannot be manufactured by rubberstamping an ordinary man his symptoms are described here a mahtm is always engaged in chanting the glories of the supreme lord ka the personality of godhead he has no other business he is always engaged in the glorification of the lord in other words he is not an impersonalist when the question of glorification is there one has to glorify the supreme lord praising his holy name his eternal form his transcendental qualities and his uncommon pastimes one has to glorify all these things therefore a mahtm is attached to the supreme personality of godhead one who is attached to the impersonal feature of the supreme lord the brahmajyoti is not described as mahtm in the bhagavadgt he is described in a different way in the next verse the mahtm is always engaged in different activities of devotional service as described in the rmad bhgavatam hearing and chanting about viu not a demigod or human being that is devotion ravaa krtana vio smaraam and remembering him such a mahtm has firm determination to achieve at the ultimate end the association of the supreme lord in any one of the five transcendental rasas to achieve that success he engages all activities mental bodily and vocal everythingin the service of the supreme lord r ka that is called full ka consciousness in devotional service there are certain activities which are called determined such as fasting on certain days like the eleventh day of the moon ekda and on the appearance day of the lord etc all these rules and regulations are offered by the great cryas for those who are actually interested in getting admission into the association of the supreme personality of godhead in the transcendental world the mahtms great souls strictly observe all these rules and regulations and therefore they are sure to achieve the desired result as described in the second verse of this chapter this devotional service is not only easy but it can be performed in a happy mood one does not need to undergo any severe penance and austerity he can live this life in devotional service guided by an expert spiritual master and in any position either as a householder or a sannys or a brahmacr in any position and anywhere in the world he can perform this devotional service to the supreme personality of godhead and thus become actually mahtm a great soul text 15 jnayajena cpy anye yajanto mm

bahudhdiversity vivatamukham in the universal form translation others who are engaged in the cultivation of knowledge worship the supreme lord as the one without a second diverse in many and in the universal form purport this verse is the summary of the previous verses the lord tells arjuna that those who are purely in ka consciousness and do not know anything other than ka are called mahtm yet there are other persons who are not exactly in the position of mahtm but who worship ka also in different ways some of them are already described as the distressed the financially destitute the inquisitive and those who are engaged in the cultivation of knowledge but there are others who are still lower and these are divided into three 1 he who worships himself as one with the supreme lord 2 he who concocts some form of the supreme lord and worships that and 3 he who accepts the universal form the vivarpa of the supreme personality of godhead and worships that out of the above three the lowest those who worship themselves as the supreme lord thinking themselves to be monists are most predominant such people think themselves to be the supreme lord and in this mentality they worship themselves this is also a type of god worship for they can understand that they are not the material body but are actually spiritual soul at least such a sense is prominent generally the impersonalists worship the supreme lord in this way the second class includes the worshipers of the demigods those who by imagination consider any form to be the form of the supreme lord and the third class includes those who cannot conceive of anything beyond the manifestation of this material universe they consider the universe to be the supreme organism or entity and worship that the universe is also a form of the lord text 16 aha kratur aha yaja svadhham aham auadham mantro ham aham evjyam aham agnir aha hutam ahami kraturitual ahami yajasacrifice svadhoblation ahami ahami auadhamhealing

the healing herb the transcendental chant i am the butter and the fire and the offering purport the sacrifice known as jyotioma is also ka and he is also the mahyaja the oblations offered to the pitloka or the sacrifice performed to please the pitloka considered as a kind of drug in the form of clarified butter is also ka the mantras chanted in this connection are also ka and many other commodities made with milk products for offering in the sacrifices are also ka the fire is also ka because fire is one of the five material elements and is therefore claimed as the separated energy of ka in other words the vedic sacrifices recommended in the karmaka division of the vedas are in total also ka or in other words those who are engaged in rendering devotional service unto ka are to be understood to have performed all the sacrifices recommended in the vedas text 17 pitham asya jagato mt dht pitmaha vedya pavitram okra k sma yajur eva ca pitfather ahami asyaof this jagataof the

the entire cosmic manifestations moving and nonmoving are manifested by different activities of kas energy in the material existence we create different relationships with different living entities who are nothing but kas marginal energy but under the creation of prakti some of them appear as our father mother grandfather creator etc but actually they are parts and parcels of ka as such these living entities who appear to be our father mother etc are nothing but ka in this verse the word dht means creator not only are our father and mother parts and parcels of ka but their creator grandmother and grandfather etc are also ka actually any living entity being part and parcel of ka is ka all the vedas therefore aim only toward ka whatever we want to know through the vedas is but a progressive step to understand ka that subject matter which helps us purify our constitutional position is especially ka similarly the living entity who is inquisitive to understand all vedic principles is also part and parcel of ka and as such is also ka in all the vedic mantras the word om called praava is a transcendental sound vibration and is also ka and because in all the hymns of the four vedas sma yajur g and atharva the praava or omkra is very prominent it is understood to be ka text 18 gatir bhart prabhu sk nivsa araa suht prabhava pralaya sthna nidhna bjam avyayam gatigoal

purport gati means the destination where we want to go but the ultimate goal is ka although people do not know it one who does not know ka is misled and his socalled progressive march is either partial or hallucinatory there are many who make as their destination different demigods and by rigid performance of the strict respective methods they reach different planets known as candraloka sryaloka indraloka maharloka etc but all such lokas or planets being creations of ka are simultaneously ka and not ka actually such planets being the manifestations of kas energy are also ka but actually they only serve as a step forward for realization of ka to approach the different energies of ka is to approach ka indirectly one should directly approach ka for that will save time and energy for example if there is a possibility of going to the top of a building by the help of an elevator why should one go by the staircase step by step everything is resting on kas energy therefore without kas shelter nothing can exist ka is the supreme ruler because everything belongs to him and everything exists on his energy ka being situated in everyones heart is the supreme witness the residences countries or planets on which we live are also ka ka is the ultimate goal of shelter and as such one should take shelter of ka either for protection or for annihilation of his distressed condition and whenever we have to take protection we should know that our protection must be a living force thus ka is the supreme living entity since ka is the source of our generation or the supreme father no one can be a better friend than ka nor can anyone be a better wellwisher ka is the original source of creation and the ultimate rest after annihilation ka is therefore the eternal cause of all causes text 19 tapmy aham aha vara nighmy utsjmi ca amta caiva mtyu ca sad asac cham arjuna tapmigive heat ahami ahami varamrain nighmi withold utsjmisend forth caand amtamimmortality caand

and nonbeing are in me purport ka by his different energies diffuses heat and light through the agency of electricity and the sun during summer season it is ka who checks rain from falling from the sky and then during the rainy season he gives unceasing torrents of rain the energy which sustains us by prolonging the duration of our life is ka and ka meets us at the end as death by analyzing all these different energies of ka one can acertain that for ka there is no distinction between matter and spirit or in other words he is both matter and spirit in the advanced stage of ka consciousness one does not therefore make such distinctions he sees ka only in everything since ka is both matter and spirit the gigantic universal form comprising all material manifestations is also ka and his pastimes in vndvana as twohanded ymasundara playing on a flute are those of the supreme personality of godhead text 20 traividy m somap ptapp yajair iv svargati prrthayante te puyam sdya surendralokam

the soma juice seeking the heavenly planets worship me indirectly they take birth on the planet of indra where they enjoy godly delights purport the word traividy refers to the three vedas sma yajur and g a brhmaa who has studied these three vedas is called a trived anyone who is very much attached to knowledge derived from these three vedas is respected in society unfortunately there are many great scholars of the vedas who do not know the ultimate purport of studying them therefore ka herein declares himself to be the ultimate goal for the triveds actual triveds take shelter under the lotus feet of ka and engage in pure devotional service to satisfy the lord devotional service begins with the chanting of the hare ka mantra and side by side trying to understand ka in truth unfortunately those who are simply official students of the vedas become more interested in offering sacrifices to the different demigods like indra candra etc by such endeavor the worshipers of different demigods are certainly purified of the contamination of the lower qualities of nature and are thereby elevated to the higher planetary system or heavenly planets known as maharloka janaloka tapoloka etc once situated on those higher planetary systems one can satisfy his senses hundreds of thousands of times better than on this planet text 21 te ta bhuktv svargaloka vila ke puye

they return to this mortal planet again thus through the vedic principles they achieve only flickering happiness purport one who is promoted to those higher planetary systems enjoys a longer duration of life and better facilities for sense enjoyment yet one is not allowed to stay there forever one is again sent back to this earthly planet upon finishing the resultant fruits of pious activities he who has not attained perfection of knowledge as indicated in the vedntastra janmdy asya yata or in other words he who fails to understand ka the cause of all causes becomes baffled in achieving the ultimate goal of life and is thus subjected to the routine of being promoted to the higher planets and then again coming down as if situated on a ferris wheel which sometimes goes up and sometimes comes down the purport is that instead of being elevated to the spiritual world where there is no longer any possibility of coming down one simply revolves in the cycle of birth and death on higher and lower planetary systems one should better take to the spiritual world to enjoy eternal life full of bliss and knowledge and never return to this miserable material existence text 22 anany

purport one who is unable to live for a moment without ka consciousness cannot but think of ka twentyfour hours being engaged in devotional service by hearing chanting remembering offering prayers worshiping serving the lotus feet of the lord rendering other services cultivating friendship and surrendering fully to the lord such activities are all auspicious and full of spiritual potencies indeed they make the devotee perfect in selfrealization then his only desire is to achieve the association of the supreme personality of godhead this is called yoga by the mercy of the lord such a devotee never comes back to this material condition of life kema refers to the merciful protection of the lord the lord helps the devotee to achieve ka consciousness by yoga and when he becomes fully ka conscious the lord protects him from falling down to a miserable conditioned life text 23 ye py anyadevatbhakt yajante raddhaynvit te pi mm eva kaunteya yajanty avidhiprvakam yethose apialso

man may sacrifice to other gods o son of kunt is really meant for me alone but it is offered without true understanding purport persons who are engaged in the worship of demigods are not very intelligent although such worship is done to me indirectly ka says for example when a man pours water on the leaves and branches of a tree without pouring water on the root he does so without sufficient knowledge or without observing regulative principles similarly the process of rendering service to different parts of the body is to supply food to the stomach the demigods are so to speak different officers and directors in the government of the supreme lord one has to follow the laws made by the government not by the officers or directors similarly everyone is to offer his worship to the supreme lord only that will automatically satisfy the different officers and directors of the lord the officers and directors are engaged as representatives of the government and to offer some bribe to the officers and directors is illegal this is stated here as avidhiprvakam in other words ka does not approve the unnecessary worship of the demigods text 24 aha hi sarvayajn bhokt ca prabhur

cyavantifall down tethey translation i am the only enjoyer and the only object of sacrifice those who do not recognize my true transcendental nature fall down purport here it is clearly stated that there are many types of yaja performances recommended in the vedic literatures but actually all of them are meant for satisfying the supreme lord yaja means viu in the second chapter of bhagavadgt it is clearly stated that one should only work for satisfying yaja or viu the perfectional form of human civilization known as varrama dharma is specifically meant for satisfying viu therefore ka says in this verse i am the enjoyer of all sacrifices because i am the supreme master however less intelligent persons without knowing this fact worship demigods for temporary benefit therefore they fall down to material existence and do not achieve the desired goal of life if however anyone has any material desire to be fulfilled he had better pray for it to the supreme lord although that is not pure devotion and he will thus achieve the desired result text 25 ynti devavrat devn pitn ynti pitvrat bhtni ynti bhtejy ynti madyjino pi mm yntiachieve devavratworshipers of demigods devnto demigods

worship the demigods will take birth among the demigods those who worship ghosts and spirits will take birth among such beings those who worship ancestors go to the ancestors and those who worship me will live with me purport if anyone has any desire to go to the moon the sun or any other planet one can attain the desired destination by following specific vedic principles recommended for that purpose these are vividly described in the fruitive activities portion of the vedas technically known as darapaurams which recommends a specific worship of demigods situated on different heavenly planets similarly one can attain the pit planets by performing a specific yaja similarly one can go to many ghostly planets and become a yaka raka or pica pica worship is called black arts or black magic there are many men who practice this black art and they think that it is spiritualism but such activities are completely materialistic similarly a pure devotee who worships the supreme personality of godhead only achieves the planets of vaikuha and kaloka without a doubt it is very easy to understand through this important verse that if by simply worshiping the demigods one can achieve the heavenly planets or by worshiping the pit achieve the pit planets or by practicing the black arts achieve the ghostly planets why can the pure devotee not achieve the planet of ka or viu unfortunately many people have no information of these sublime planets where ka and viu live and because they do not know of them they fall down even the impersonalists fall down from the brahmajyoti this ka consciousness movement is therefore distributing sublime information to the entire human society to the effect that by simply chanting the hare ka mantra one can become perfect in this life and go back home back to godhead text 26 patra pupa phala to ya yo me bhakty prayacchati tad aha bhaktyupahtam anmi prayattmana patrama leaf pupama flower phalama fruit toyamwater ya whoever meunto me bhaktywith devotion prayacchatioffers tat that ahami bhaktiupahtamoffered in devotion anmiaccept prayatatmanaof one in pure consciousness translation if one offers me with love and devotion a leaf a flower fruit or water i will accept it purport here lord ka having established that he is the only enjoyer the primeval lord and the real object of all sacrificial offerings reveals what types of sacrifices he desires to be offered if one wishes to engage in devotional service to the supreme in order to be purified and to reach the goal of lifethe transcendental loving service of godthen he should find out what the lord desires of him one who loves ka will give him whatever he wants and he avoids offering anything which is undesirable or unasked for thus meat fish and eggs should not be offered to ka if he desired such things as offerings he would have said so instead he clearly requests that a leaf fruit flowers and water be given to him and he says of this offering i will accept it therefore we should understand that he will not accept meat fish and eggs vegetables grains fruits milk and water are the proper foods for human beings and are prescribed by lord ka himself whatever else we eat cannot be offered to him since he will not accept it thus we cannot be acting on the level of loving devotion if we offer such foods in the third chapter verse thirteen r ka explains that only the remains of sacrifice are purified and fit for consumption by those who are seeking advancement in life and release from the clutches of the material entanglement those who do not make an offering of their food he says in the same verse are said to be eating only sin in other words their every mouthful is simply deepening their involvement in the complexities of material nature but preparing nice simple vegetable dishes offering them before the picture or deity of lord ka and bowing down and praying for him to accept such a humble offering enable one to advance steadily in life to purify the body and to create fine brain tissues which will lead to clear thinking above all the offering should be made with an attitude of love ka has no need of food since he already possesses everything that be yet he will accept the offering of one who desires to please him in that way the important element in preparation in serving and in offering is to act with love for ka the impersonalist philosophers who wish to maintain that the absolute truth is without senses cannot comprehend this verse of bhagavadgt to them it is either a metaphor or proof of the mundane character of ka the speaker of the gt but in actuality ka the supreme godhead has senses and it is stated that his senses are interchangeable in other words one sense can perform the function of any other this is what it means to say that ka is absolute lacking senses he could hardly be considered full in all opulences in the seventh chapter ka has explained that he impregnates the living entities into material nature this is done by his looking upon material nature and so in this instance kas hearing the devotees words of love in offering foodstuffs is wholly identical with his eating and actually tasting this point should be emphasized because of his absolute position his hearing is wholly identical with his eating and tasting only the devotee who accepts ka as he describes himself without interpretation can understand that the supreme absolute truth can eat food and enjoy it text 27 yat karoi yad ansi yaj juhoi dadsi yat yat tapasyasi kaunteya tat kuruva mad arpaam yatwhat karoiyou do

translation o son of kunt all that you do all that you eat all that you offer and give away as well as all austerities that you may perform should be done as an offering unto me purport thus it is the duty of everyone to mold his life in such a way that he will not forget ka in any circumstance everyone has to work for maintenance of his body and soul together and ka recommends herein that one should work for him everyone has to eat something to live therefore he should accept the remnants of foodstuffs offered to ka any civilized man has to perform some religious ritualistic ceremonies therefore ka recommends do it for me and this is called arcan everyone has a tendency to give something in charity ka says give it to me and this means that all surplus money accummulated should be utilized in furthering the ka consciousness movement nowadays people are very much inclined to the meditational process which is not practical in this age but if anyone practices meditating on ka twentyfour hours by chanting the hare ka mantra round his beads he is surely the greatest yog as substantiated by the sixth chapter of bhagavadgt text 28 ubhubhaphalair eva mokyase karmabandhanai

vimukta liberated mmto me upaiyasiyou will attain translation in this way you will be freed from all reactions to good and evil deeds and by this principle of renunciation you will be liberated and come to me purport one who acts in ka consciousness under superior direction is called yukta the technical term is yuktavairgya this is further explained by rpa gosvm as follows rpa gosvm says that as long as we are in this material world we have to act we cannot cease acting therefore if actions are performed and the fruits are given to ka then that is called yuktavairgya actually situated in renunciation such activities clear the mirror of the mind and as the actor gradually makes progress in spiritual realization he becomes completely surrendered to the supreme personality of godhead therefore at the end he becomes liberated and this liberation is also specified by this liberation he does not become one with the brahmajyoti but rather enters into the planet of the supreme lord it is clearly mentioned here mm upaiyasi he comes to me back home back to godhead there are five different stages of liberation and here it is specified that the devotee who has always lived his lifetime here under the direction of the supreme lord as stated has evolved to the point where he can after quitting this body go back to godhead and engage directly in the association of the supreme lord anyone who has no other interest but to dedicate his life to the service of the lord is actually a sannys such a person always thinks of himself as an eternal servant dependant on the supreme will of the lord as such whatever he does he does it for the benefit of the lord whatever action he performs he performs it as service to the lord he does not give serious attention to the fruitive activities or prescribed duties mentioned in the vedas for ordinary persons it is obligatory to execute the prescribed duties mentioned in the vedas but although a pure devotee who is completely engaged in the service of the lord may sometimes appear to go against the prescribed vedic duties actually it is not so it is said therefore by vaiava authorities that even the most intelligent person cannot understand the plans and activities of a pure devotee the exact words are vaiavera kriy mudr vije n bujhay a person who is thus always engaged in the service of the lord or is always thinking and planning how to serve the lord is to be considered completely liberated at present and in the future his going home back to godhead is guaranteed he is above all materialistic criticism just as ka is above all criticism text 29 samo ha sarvabhteu na me dveyo sti na priya ye bhajanti tu m bhakty mayi te teu cpy aham samaequally disposed ahami sarvabhteuto all living entities nano one memine

no one nor am i partial to anyone i am equal to all but whoever renders service unto me in devotion is a friend is in me and i am also a friend to him purport one may question here that if ka is equal to everyone and no one is his special friend then why does he take a special interest in the devotees who are always engaged in his transcendental service but this is not discrimination it is natural any man in this material world may be very charitably disposed yet he has a special interest in his own children the lord claims that every living entityin whatever formis his son and as such he provides everyone with a generous supply of the necessities of life he is just like a cloud which pours rain all over regardless whether it falls on rock or land or water but for his devotees he gives specific attention such devotees are mentioned here they are always in ka consciousness and therefore they are always transcendentally situated in ka the very phrase ka consciousness suggests that those who are in such consciousness are living transcendentalists situated in him the lord says here distinctly mayi te in me naturally as a result the lord is also in them this is reciprocal this also explains the words asti na priyaye bhajanti whoever surrenders unto me proportionately i take care of him this transcendental reciprocation exists because both the lord and the devotee are conscious when a diamond is set in a golden ring it looks very nice the gold is glorified and at the same time the diamond is glorified the lord and the living entity eternally glitter and when a living entity becomes inclined to the service of the supreme lord he looks like gold the lord is a diamond and so this combination is very nice living entities in a pure state are called devotees the supreme lord becomes the devotee of his devotees if a reciprocal relationship is not present between the devotee and the lord then there is no personalist philosophy in the impersonal philosophy there is no reciprocation between the supreme and the living entity but in the personalist philosophy there is the example is often given that the lord is like a desire tree and whatever one wants from this desire tree the lord supplies but here the explanation is more complete the lord is here stated to be partial to the devotees this is the manifestation of the lords special mercy to the devotees the lords reciprocation should not be considered to be under the law of karma it belongs to the transcendental situation in which the lord and his devotees function devotional service of the lord is not an activity of this material world it is part of the spiritual world where eternity bliss and knowledge predominate text 30 api cet sudurcro bhajate mm ananyabhk sdhur eva sa mantavya samyag vyavasito

because he is properly situated purport the word sudurcro used in this verse is very significant and we should understand it properly when a living entity is conditioned he has two kinds of activities one is conditional and the other is constitutional as for protecting the body or abiding by the rules of society and state certainly there are different activities even for the devotees in connection with the conditional life and such activities are called conditional besides these the living entity who is fully conscious of his spiritual nature and is engaged in ka consciousness or the devotional service of the lord has activities which are called transcendental such activities are performed in his constitutional position and they are technically called devotional service now in the conditioned state sometimes devotional service and the conditional service in relation to the body will parallel one another but then again sometimes these activities become opposed to one another as far as possible a devotee is very cautious so that he does not do anything that could disrupt his wholesome condition he knows that perfection in his activities depends on his progressive realization of ka consciousness sometimes however it may be seen that a person in ka consciousness commits some act which may be taken as most abominable socially or politically but such a temporary falldown does not disqualify him in the rmadbhgavatam it is stated that if a person falls down but is wholeheartedly engaged in the transcendental service of the supreme lord the lord being situated within his heart beautifies him and excuses him from that abomination the material contamination is so strong that even a yog fully engaged in the service of the lord sometimes becomes ensnared but ka consciousness is so strong that such an occasional falldown is at once rectified therefore the process of devotional service is always a success no one should deride a devotee for some accidental falldown from the ideal path for as is explained in the next verse such occasional falldowns will be stopped in due course as soon as a devotee is completely situated in ka consciousness therefore a person who is situated in ka consciousness and is engaged with determination in the process of chanting hare ka hare ka ka ka hare harehare rma hare rma rma rma hare hare should be considered to be in the transcendental position even if by chance or accident he is found to have fallen the words sdhur eva he is saintly are very emphatic they are a warning to the nondevotees that because of an accidental falldown a devotee should not be derided he should still be considered saintly even if he has fallen down accidentally and the word mantavya is still more emphatic if one does not follow this rule and derides a devotee for his accidental falldown then he is disobeying the order of the supreme lord the only qualification of a devotee is to be unflinchingly and exclusively engaged in devotional service the mark of a spot which may be seen on the moon does not become an impediment to the moonlight similarly the accidental falldown of a devotee from the path of a saintly character does not make him abominable on the other hand one should not misunderstand that a devotee in transcendental devotional service can act in all kinds of abominable ways this verse only refers to an accident due to the strong power of material connections devotional service is more or less a declaration of war against the illusory energy as long as one is not strong enough to fight the illusory energy there may be accidental falldowns but when one is strong enough he is no longer subjected to such falldowns as previously explained no one should take advantage of this verse and commit nonsense and think that he is still a devotee if he does not improve in his character by devotional service then it is to be understood that he is not a high devotee text 31 kipra bhavati dharmtm

nanever memine bhaktadevotee praayatiperishes translation he quickly becomes righteous and attains lasting peace o son of kunt declare it boldly that my devotee never perishes purport this should not be misunderstood in the seventh chapter the lord says that one who is engaged in mischievous activities cannot become a devotee of the lord one who is not a devotee of the lord has no good qualifications whatsoever the question remains then how can a person engaged in abominable activitieseither by accident or intentionbe a pure devotee this question may justly be raised the miscreants as stated in the seventh chapter who never come to the devotional service of the lord have no good qualifications as is stated in the rmadbhgavatam generally a devotee who is engaged in the nine kinds of devotional activities is engaged in the process of cleansing all material contamination from the heart he puts the supreme personality of godhead within his heart and all sinful contaminations are naturally washed away continuous thinking of the supreme lord makes him pure by nature according to the vedas there is a certain regulation that if one falls down from his exalted position he has to undergo certain ritualistic processes to purify himself but here there is no such condition because the purifying process is already there in the heart of the devotee due to his remembering the supreme personality of godhead constantly therefore the chanting of hare ka hare ka ka ka hare hare hare rma hare rma rma rma hare hare should be continued without stoppage this will protect a devotee from all accidental falldowns he will thus remain perpetually free from all material contaminations text 32 m hi prtha vyapritya ye pi syu ppayonaya striyo vaiys tath drs te pi ynti par gatim mmunto

supreme destination purport it is clearly declared here by the supreme lord that in devotional service there is no distinction between the lower or higher classes of people in the material conception of life there are such divisions but for a person engaged in transcendental devotional service to the lord there are not everyone is eligible for the supreme destination in the rmadbhgavatam it is stated that even the lowest who are called calas dogeaters can be elevated by association with a pure devotee therefore devotional service and guidance of a pure devotee are so strong that there is no discrimination between the lower and higher classes of men anyone can take to it the most simple man taking center of the pure devotee can be purified by proper guidance according to the different modes of material nature men are classified in the mode of goodness brhmaas the mode of passion katriyas or administrators the mixed modes of passion and ignorance vaiyas or merchants and the mode of ignorance dras or workers those lower than them are called calas and they are born in sinful families generally those who are born in sinful families are not accepted by the higher classes but the process of devotional service and the pure devotee of the supreme god are so strong that all the lower classes can attain the highest perfection of life this is possible only when one takes center of ka one has to take center completely of ka then one can become much greater than great jns and yogs text 33 ki punar brhma puy bhakt rjarayas tath anityam asukha lokam ima prpya bhajasva mm kimhow

there are classifications of people but after all this world is not a happy place for anyone it is clearly stated here anityam asukha lokam this world is temporary and full of miseries not habitable for any sane gentleman this world is declared by the supreme personality of godhead to be temporary and full of miseries some of the philosophers especially the minor philosophers say that this world is false but we can understand from bhagavadgt that the world is not false it is temporary there is a difference between temporary and false this world is temporary but there is another world which is eternal this world is miserable but the other world is eternal and blissful arjuna was born in a saintly royal family to him also the lord says take to my devotional service and come quickly back to godhead back home no one should remain in this temporary world full as it is with miseries everyone should attach himself to the bosom of the supreme personality of godhead so that he can be eternally happy the devotional service of the supreme lord is the only process by which all problems of all classes of men can be solved everyone should therefore take to ka consciousness and make his life perfect text 34 manman bhava madbhakto madyj m namaskuru mm evaiyasi yuktvaivam tmna matparyaa matmanalways thinking of me bhavabecome matmy bhakta devotee matmy yjworshiper mmunto me namaskuruoffer

being completely absorbed in me surely you will come to me purport in this verse it is clearly indicated that ka consciousness is the only means of being delivered from the clutches of this contaminated material world sometimes unscrupulous commentators distort the meaning of what is clearly stated here that all devotional service should be offered to the supreme personality of godhead ka unfortunately unscrupulous commentators divert the mind of the reader to that which is not at all feasible such commentators do not know that there is no difference between kas mind and ka ka is not an ordinary human being he is absolute truth his body mind and he himself are one and absolute it is stated in the krma pura as it is quoted by bhaktisiddhnta sarasvat gosvm in his anubhya comments on caitanyacaritmrta fifth chapter dill verses 4148 dehadehivibhedo ya nevare vidyate kvacit which means that there is no difference in ka the supreme lord between himself and his body but because they do not know this science of ka the commentators hide ka and divide his personality from his mind or from his body although this is sheer ignorance of the science of ka some men make profit out of misleading the people there are some who are demonic they also think of ka but enviously just like king kasa kas uncle he was also thinking of ka always but he thought of ka as his enemy he was always in anxiety wondering when ka would come to kill him that kind of thinking will not help us one should be thinking of ka in devotional love that is bhakti one should cultivate the knowledge of ka continually what is that favorable cultivation it is to learn from a bona fide teacher ka is the supreme personality of godhead and we have several times explained that his body is not material but is eternal blissful knowledge this kind of talk about ka will help one become a devotee otherwise understanding ka from the wrong source will prove fruitless one should therefore engage his mind in the eternal form the primal form of ka with conviction in his heart that ka is the supreme he should engage himself in worship there are hundreds of thousands of temples in india for the worship of ka and devotional service is practiced there when such practice is made one has to offer obeisances to ka one should lower his head before the deity and engage his mind his body his activitieseverything that will make one fully absorbed in ka without deviation this will help one transfer into the kaloka one should not be deviated by unscrupulous commentators one must engage in the nine different processes of devotional service beginning with hearing and chanting about ka pure devotional service is the highest achievement of human society in the seventh and eighth chapters of bhagavadgt pure devotional service to the lord has been explained apart from the yoga of knowledge and mystic yoga or fruitive activities those who are not purely sanctified may be attracted by different features of the lord like the impersonal brahmajyoti and localized paramtm but a pure devotee directly takes to the service of the supreme lord there is a beautiful poem about ka in which it is clearly stated that any person who is engaged in the worship of demigods is most unintelligent and cannot achieve at any time the supreme award of ka the devotee in the beginning may sometimes fall from the standard but still he should be considered superior to all other philosophers and yogs one who always engages in ka consciousness should be understood to be the perfect saintly person his accidental nondevotional activities will diminish and he will soon be situated without any doubt in complete perfection the pure devotee has no actual chance to fall down because the supreme godhead personally takes care of his pure devotees therefore the intelligent person should take directly to this process of ka consciousness and happily live in this material world he will eventually receive the supreme award of ka thus end the bhaktivedanta purports to the ninth chapter of the rmadbhagavadgt in the matter of the most confidential knowledge chapter ten the opulence of the absolute text 1

again to my supreme word which i shall impart to you for your benefit and which will give you great joy purport the word paramam is explained thus by parara muni one who is full in six opulences who has full strength full fame wealth knowledge beauty and renunciation is paramam or the supreme personality of godhead while ka was present on this earth he displayed all six opulences therefore great sages like parara muni have all accepted ka as the supreme personality of godhead now ka is instructing arjuna in more confidential knowledge of his opulences and his work previously beginning with the seventh chapter the lord already explained his different energies and how they are acting now in this chapter he explains his specific opulences to arjuna in the previous chapter he has clearly explained his different energies to establish devotion in firm conviction again in this chapter he tells arjuna about his manifestations and various opulences the more one hears about the supreme god the more one becomes fixed in devotional service one should always hear about the lord in the association of devotees that will enhance ones devotional service discourses in the society of devotees can take place only among those who are really anxious to be in ka consciousness others cannot take part in such discourses the lord clearly tells arjuna that because he is very dear to him for his benefit such discourses are taking place text 2 na me vidu suraga prabhava na maharaya aham dir hi devn mahar ca sarvaa nanever memy viduknows suragademigods prabhavam opulences nanever maharayagreat sages ahami am dithe origin hicertainly devnmof the demigods maharmof the great sages caalso sarvaain all respects translation neither the hosts of demigods nor the great sages know my origin for in every respect i am the source of the demigods and the sages purport as stated in the brahmasahit lord ka is the supreme lord no one is greater than him he is the cause of all causes here it is also stated by the lord personally that he is the cause of all the demigods and sages even the demigods and great sages cannot understand ka they can understand neither his name nor his personality so what is the position of the socalled scholars of this tiny planet no one can understand why this supreme god comes to earth as an ordinary human being and executes such commonplace and yet wonderful activities one should know then that scholarship is not the qualification necessary to understand ka even the demigods and the great sages have tried to understand ka by their mental speculation and they have failed to do so in the rmad bhgavatam also it is clearly said that even the great demigods are not able to understand the supreme personality of godhead they can speculate to the limits of their imperfect senses and can reach the opposite conclusion of impersonalism of something not manifested by the three qualities of material nature or they can imagine something by mental speculation but it is not possible to understand ka by such foolish speculation here the lord indirectly says that if anyone wants to know the absolute truth here i am present as the supreme personality of godhead i am the supreme one should know this although one cannot understand the inconceivable lord who is personally present he nonetheless exists we can actually understand ka who is eternal full of bliss and knowledge simply by studying his words in bhagavadgt and rmadbhgavatam the impersonal brahman can be conceived by persons who are already in the inferior energy of the lord but the personality of godhead cannot be conceived unless one is in the transcendental position because most men cannot understand ka in his actual situation out of his causeless mercy he descends to show favor to such speculators yet despite the supreme lords uncommon activities these speculators due to contamination in the material energy still think that the impersonal brahman is the supreme only the devotees who are fully surrendered unto the supreme lord can understand by the grace of the supreme personality that he is ka the devotees of the lord do not bother about the impersonal brahman conception of god their faith and devotion bring them to surrender immediately unto the supreme lord and out of the causeless mercy of ka they can understand ka no one else can understand him so even great sages agree what is tm what is the supreme it is he whom we have to worship text 3 yo mm ajam andi ca vetti lokamahevaram asammha sa martyeu sarvappai pramucyate yaanyone mmunto me ajamunborn

delivered translation he who knows me as the unborn as the beginningless as the supreme lord of all the worldshe undeluded among men is freed from all sins purport as stated in the seventh chapter those who are trying to elevate themselves to the platform of spiritual realization are not ordinary men they are superior to millions and millions of ordinary men who have no knowledge of spiritual realization but out of those actually trying to understand their spiritual situation one who can come to the understanding that kais the supreme personality of godhead the proprietor of everything the unborn is the most successful spiritually realized person in that stage only when one has fully understood kas supreme position can one be free completely from all sinful reactions here the word ajam meaning unborn should not be confused with the living entities who are described in the second chapter as ajam the lord is different from the living entities who are taking birth and dying due to material attachment the conditional souls are changing their bodies but his body is not changeable even when he comes to this material world he comes as the same unborn therefore in the fourth chapter it is said that the lord by his internal potency is not under the inferior material energy but is always in the superior energy he was existing before the creation and he is different from his creation all the demigods were created within this material world but as far as ka is concerned it is said that he is not created therefore ka is different even from the great demigods like brahm and iva and because he is the creator of brahm iva and all the other demigods he is the supreme person of all planets r ka is therefore different from everything that is created and anyone who knows him as such immediately becomes liberated from all sinful reaction one must be liberated from all sinful activities to be in the knowledge of the supreme lord only by devotional service can he be known and not by any other means as stated in bhagavadgt one should not try to understand ka as a human being as stated previously only a foolish person thinks him to be a human being this is again expressed here in a different way a man who is not foolish who is intelligent enough to understand the constitutional position of the godhead is always free from all sinful reactions if ka is known as the son of devak then how can he be unborn that is also explained in rmadbhgavatam when he appeared before devak and vasudeva he was not born as an ordinary child he appeared in his original form and then he transformed himself into an ordinary child anything done under the direction of ka is transcendental it cannot be contaminated by the material reactions which may be auspicious or inauspicious the conception that there are things auspicious and inauspicious in the material world is more or less a mental concoction because there is nothing auspicious in the material world everything is inauspicious because the very material mask is inauspicious we simply imagine it to be auspicious real auspiciousness depends on activities in ka consciousness in full devotion and service therefore if we at all want our activities to he auspicious then we should work under the directions of the supreme lord such directions are given in authoritative scriptures such as rmadbhgavatam and bhagavadgt or from a bona fide spiritual master because the spiritual master is the representative of the supreme lord his direction is directly the direction of the supreme lord the spiritual master saintly persons and scriptures direct in the same way there is no contradiction in these three sources all actions done under such direction are free from the reactions of pious or impious activities of this material world the transcendental attitude of the devotee in the performance of activities is actually that of renunciation and this is called sannysa anyone acting under the direction of the supreme lord is actually a sannys and a yog and not the man who has simply taken the dress of the sannys or a pseudoyog texts 45 buddhir jnam asammoha kam satya dama ama sukha dukha bhavo bhvo bhaya

purport the different qualities of living entities be they good or bad are all created by ka and they are described here intelligence refers to the power of analyzing things in proper perspective and knowledge refers to understanding what is spirit and what is matter ordinary knowledge obtained by a university education pertains only to matter and it is not accepted here as knowledge knowledge means knowing the distinction between spirit and matter in modern education there is no knowledge about the spirit they are simply taking care of the material elements and bodily needs therefore academic knowledge is not complete asamoha freedom from doubt and delusion can be achieved when one is not hesitant and when he understands the transcendental philosophy slowly but surely he becomes free from bewilderment nothing should be accepted blindly everything should be accepted with care and with caution kam forgiveness should be practiced and one should excuse the minor offenses of others satyam truthfulness means that facts should be presented as they are for the benefit of others facts should not be misrepresented according to social conventions it is said that one can speak the truth only when it is palatable to others but that is not truthfulness the truth should be spoken in a straight and forward way so that others will understand actually what the facts are if a man is a thief and if people are warned that he is a thief that is truth although sometimes the truth is unpalatable one should not refrain from speaking it truthfulness demands that the facts be presented as they are for the benefit of others that is the definition of truth selfcontrol means that the senses should not be used for unnecessary personal enjoyment there is no prohibition against meeting the proper needs of the senses but unnecessary sense enjoyment is detrimental for spiritual advancement therefore the senses should be restrained from unnecessary use similarly the mind should not indulge in unnecessary thoughts that is called ama or calmness nor should one spend ones time pondering over earning money that is a misuse of the thinking power the mind should be used to understand the prime necessity of human beings and that should be presented authoritatively the power of thought should be developed in association with persons who are authorities in the scriptures saintly persons and spiritual masters and those whose thinking is highly developed sukham pleasure or happiness should always be in that which is favorable for the cultivation of the spiritual knowledge of ka consciousness and similarly that which is painful or which causes distress is that which is unfavorable for the cultivation of ka consciousness anything favorable for the development of ka consciousness should be accepted and anything unfavorable should be rejected bhava birth should be understood to refer to the body as far as the soul is concerned there is neither birth nor death that we have discussed in the beginning of bhagavadgt birth and death apply to ones embodiment in the material world fear is due to worrying about the future a person in ka consciousness has no fear because by his activities he is sure to go back to the spiritual sky back home back to godhead therefore his future is very bright others however do not know what their future holds they have no knowledge of what the next life holds so they are therefore in constant anxiety if we want to get free from anxiety then the best course is to understand ka and be situated always in ka consciousness in that way we will be free from all fear in the rmadbhgavatam it is stated that fear is caused by our absorption in the illusory energy but those who are free from the illusory energy those who are confident that they are not the material body that they are spiritual parts of the supreme personality of godhead and are therefore engaged in the transcendental service of the supreme godhead have nothing to fear their future is very bright this fear is a condition of persons who are not in ka consciousness bhayam fearlessness is only possible for one in ka consciousness ahis nonviolence means that one should not do anything which will put others into misery or confusion material activities that are promised by so many politicians sociologists philanthropists etc do not produce very good results because the politicians and philanthropists have no transcendental vision they do not know what is actually beneficial for human society ahis means that people should be trained in such a way that the full utilization of the human body can be achieved the human body is meant for spiritual realization so any movement or any commissions which do not further that end commit violence on the human body that which furthers the future spiritual happiness of the people in general is called nonviolence samat equanimity refers to freedom from attachment and aversion to be very much attached or to be very much detached is not the best this material world should be accepted without attachment or aversion similarly that which is favorable for prosecuting ka consciousness should be accepted that which is unfavorable should be rejected that is called samat equanimity a person in ka consciousness has nothing to reject and nothing to accept unless it is useful in the prosecution of ka consciousness tui satisfaction means that one should not be eager to gather more and more material goods by unnecessary activity one should be satisfied with whatever is obtained by the grace of the supreme lord that is called satisfaction tapas means austerity or penance there are many rules and definitions in the vedas which apply here like rising early in the morning and taking a bath sometimes it is very troublesome to rise early in the morning but whatever voluntary trouble one may suffer in this way is called penance similarly there are prescriptions for fasting on certain days of the month one may not be inclined to practice such fasting but because of his determination to make advancement in the science of ka consciousness he should accept such bodily troubles which are recommended however one should not fast unnecessarily or against vedic injunctions one should not fast for some political purpose that is described in bhagavadgt as fasting in ignorance and anything done in ignorance or passion does not lead to spiritual advancement everything done in the mode of goodness does advance one however and fasting done in terms of the vedic injunctions enriches one in spiritual knowledge as far as charity is concerned one should give fifty percent of his earnings to some good cause and what is a good cause it is that which is conducted in terms of ka consciousness that is not only a good cause but it is the best cause because ka is good his cause is also good thus charity should be given to a person who is engaged in ka consciousness according to vedic literature it is enjoined that charity should be given to the brhmaas this practice is still followed although not very nicely in terms of the vedic injunction but still the injunction is that charity should be given to the brhmaas why because they are engaged in higher cultivation of spiritual knowledge a brhmaa issupposed to devote his whole life to understanding brahman a brahmajana is one who knows brahman he is called a brhmaa thus charity is offered to the brhmaas because since they are always engaged in higher spiritual service they have no time to earn their livelihood in the vedic literature charity is also to be awarded to the renouncer of life the sannys the sannyss beg from door to door not for money but for missionary purposes the system is that they go from door to door to awaken the householders from the slumber of ignorance because the householders are engaged in family affairs and have forgotten their actual purpose in lifeawakening their ka consciousness it is the business of the sannyss to go as beggars to the householders and encourage them to be ka conscious as it is said in the vedas one should awake and achieve what is due him in this human form of life this knowledge and method is distributed by the sannyss hence charity is to be given to the renouncer of life to the brhmaas and similar good causes not to any whimsical cause yaa fame should be according to lord caitanya who said that a man is famous when he is known as a great devotee that is real fame if one has become a great man in ka consciousness and it is known then he is truly famous one who does not have such fame is infamous all these qualities are manifest throughout the universe in human society and in the society of the demigods there are many forms of humanity on other planets and these qualities are there now for one who wants to advance in ka consciousness ka creates all these qualities but the person develops them himself from within one who engages in the devotional service of the supreme lord develops all the good qualities as arranged by the supreme lord of whatever we find good or bad the origin is ka nothing can manifest in this material world which is not in ka that is knowledge although we know that things are differently situated we should realize that everything flows from ka text 6 maharaya sapta prve catvro manavas tath madbhv mnas jt

is great but they do not know in detail how god is great here are the details if one knows factually how god is great then naturally he becomes a surrendered soul and engages himself in the devotional service of the lord when one factually knows the opulences of the supreme there is no alternative but to surrender to him this factual knowledge can be known from the descriptions in rmadbhgavatam and bhagavadgt and similar literatures in the administration of this universe there are many demigods distributed throughout the planetary system and the chief of them are brahm lord iva and the four great kumras and other patriarchs there are many forefathers of the population of the universe and all of them are born of the supreme lord ka the supreme personality of godhead ka is the original forefather of all forefathers these are some of the opulences of the supreme lord when one is firmly convinced of them he accepts ka with great faith and without any doubt and he engages in devotional service all this particular knowledge is required in order to increase ones interest in the loving devotional service of the lord one should not neglect to understand fully how great ka is for by knowing the greatness of ka one will be able to be fixed in sincere devotional service text 8 aha sarvasya prabhavo matta sarva pravartate iti matv bhajante m budh bhvasamanvit ahami sarvasyaof all

commentaries or by fools all vedic literature agrees that ka is the source of brahm iva and all other demigods in the atharvaveda it is said yo brahma vidadhti prva yo vai ved ca gpayati sma ka it was

most efficient cause of everything he says that because everything is born of me i am the original source of all everything is under me no one is above me there is no supreme controller other than ka one who understands ka in such a way from a bona fide spiritual master and from vedic literature who engages all his energy in ka consciousness becomes a truly learned man in comparison to him all others who do not know ka properly are but fools only a fool would consider ka to be an ordinary man a ka conscious person should not be bewildered by fools he should avoid all unauthorized commentaries and interpretations on bhagavadgt and proceed in ka consciousness with determination and firmness text 9 maccitt madgatapr bodhayanta parasparam kathayanta ca m nitya tuyanti ca ramanti

enlightening one another and conversing about me purport pure devotees whose characteristics are mentioned here engage themselves fully in the transcendental loving service of the lord their minds cannot be diverted from the lotus feet of ka their talks are solely on the transcendental subjects the symptoms of the pure devotees are described in this verse specifically devotees of the supreme lord are twentyfour hours daily engaged in glorifying the pastimes of the supreme lord their hearts and souls are constantly submerged in ka and they take pleasure in discussing him with other devotees in the preliminary stage of devotional service they relish the transcendental pleasure from the service itself and in the mature stage they are actually situated in love of god once situated in that transcendental position they can relish the highest perfection which is exhibited by the lord in his abode lord caitanya likens transcendental devotional service to the sowing of a seed in the heart of the living entity there are innumerable living entities traveling throughout the different planets of the universe and out of them there are a few who are fortunate enough to meet a pure devotee and get the chance to understand devotional service this devotional service is just like a seed and if it is sown in the heart of a living entity and if he goes on hearing and chanting hare ka hare ka ka ka hare hare hare rma hare rma rma rma hare hare that seed fructifies just as the seed of a tree fructifies with regular watering the spiritual plant of devotional service gradually grows and grows until it penetrates the covering of the material universe and enters into the brahmajyoti effulgence in the spiritual sky in the spiritual sky also that plant grows more and more until it reaches the highest planet which is called goloka vndvana the supreme planet of ka ultimately the plant takes shelter under the lotus feet of ka and rests there gradually as a plant grows fruits and flowers that plant of devotional service also produces fruits and the watering process in the form of chanting and hearing goes on this plant of devotional service is fully described in the caitanyacaritmta it is explained there that when the complete plant takes shelter under the lotus feet of the supreme lord one becomes fully absorbed in love of god then he cannot live even for a moment without being in contact with the supreme lord just as a fish cannot live without water in such a state the devotee actually attains the transcendental qualities in contact with the supreme lord the rmadbhgavatam is also full of such narration about the relationship between the supreme lord and his devotees therefore the rmadbhgavatam isvery dear to the devotees in this narration there is nothing about material activities sense gratification or liberation rmadbhgavatam is the only narration in which the transcendental nature of the supreme lord and his devotees is fully described thus the realized souls in ka consciousness take continual pleasure in hearing such transcendental literatures just as a young boy and girl take pleasure in association text 10 te satatayuktn bhajat

yenaby which mmunto me upaynticome tethey translation to those who are constantly devoted and worship me with love i give the understanding by which they can come to me purport in this verse the word buddhiyogam is very significant we may remember that in the second chapter the lord instructing arjuna said that he had spoken to him of many things and that he would instruct him in the way of buddhiyoga now buddhiyoga is explained buddhiyogam itself is action in ka consciousness that is the highest intelligence buddhi means intelligence and yogam means mystic activities or mystic elevation when one tries to go back home back to godhead and takes fully to ka consciousness in devotional service his action is called buddhiyogam in other words buddhiyogam is the process by which one gets out of the entanglement of this material world the ultimate goal of progress is ka people do not know this therefore the association of devotees and a bona fide spiritual master are important one should know that the goal is ka and when the goal is assigned then the path is slowly but progressively traversed and the ultimate goal is achieved when a person knows the goal of life but is addicted to the fruits of activities he is acting in karmayoga when he knows that the goal is ka but he takes pleasure in mental speculations to understand ka he is acting in jnayoga and when he knows the goal and seeks ka completely in ka consciousness and devotional service he is acting in bhaktiyoga or buddhiyoga which is the complete yoga this complete yoga is the highest perfectional stage of life a person may have a bona fide spiritual master and may be attached to a spiritual organization but still if he is not intelligent enough to make progress then ka from within gives him instructions so that he may ultimately come to him without difficulty the qualification is that a person always engage himself in ka consciousness and with love and devotion render all kinds of services he should perform some sort of work for ka and that work should be with love if a devotee is intelligent enough he will make progress on the path of selfrealization if one is sincere and devoted to the activities of devotional service the lord gives him a chance to make progress and ultimately attain to him text 11 tem evnukamprtham aham ajnaja tama naymy tmabhvastho jnadpena bhsvat temfor them

compassion for them i dwelling in their hearts destroy with the shining lamp of knowledge the darkness born of ignorance purport when lord caitanya was in benares promulgating the chanting of hare ka hare ka ka ka hare hare hare rma hare rma rma rma hare hare thousands of people were following him praknanda a very influential and learned scholar in benares at that time derided lord caitanya for being a sentimentalist sometimes philosophers criticize the devotees because they think that most of the devotees are in the darkness of ignorance and are philosophically naive sentimentalists actually that is not the fact there are very very learned scholars who have put forward the philosophy of devotion but even if a devotee does not take advantage of their literatures or of his spiritual master if he is sincere in his devotional service he is helped by ka himself within his heart so the sincere devotee engaged in ka consciousness cannot be without knowledge the only qualification is that one carry out devotional service in full ka consciousness the modern philosophers think that without discriminating one cannot have pure knowledge for them this answer is given by the supreme lord those who are engaged in pure devotional service even though they be without sufficient education and even without sufficient knowledge of the vedic principles are still helped by the supreme god as stated in this verse the lord tells arjuna that basically there is no possibility of understanding the supreme truth the absolute truth the supreme personality of godhead simply by speculating for the supreme truth is so great that it is not possible to understand him or to achieve him simply by making a mental effort man can go on speculating for several millions of years and if he is not devoted if he is not a lover of the supreme truth he will never understand ka or the supreme truth only by devotional service is the supreme truth ka pleased and by his inconceivable energy he can reveal himself to the heart of the pure devotee the pure devotee always has ka within his heart therefore he is just like the sun that dissipates the darkness of ignorance this is the special mercy rendered to the pure devotee by ka due to the contamination of material association through many many millions of births ones heart is always covered with the dust of materialism but when one engages in devotional service and constantly chants hare ka the dust quickly clears and one is elevated to the platform of pure knowledge the ultimate goal of viu can be attained only by this chant and by devotional service and not by mental speculation or argument the pure devotee does not have to worry about the necessities of life he need not be anxious because when he removes the darkness from his heart everything is provided automatically by the supreme lord for he is pleased by the loving devotional service of the devotee this is the essence of the gts teachings by studying bhagavadgt one can become a completely surrendered soul to the supreme lord and engage himself in pure devotional service as the lord takes charge one becomes completely free from all kinds of materialistic endeavors texts 1213 arjuna uvca para brahma para dhma pavitra parama bhavn purua vata divyam didevam aja vibhum hus tvm aya sarve devarir nradas tath asito devalo vysa svaya caiva bravi

transcendental and original and you are the unborn and allpervading beauty all the great sages such as nrada asita devala and vysa proclaim this of you and now you yourself are declaring it to me purport in these two verses the supreme lord gives a chance to the modern philosopher for here it is clear that the supreme is different from the individual soul arjuna after hearing the essential four verses of bhagavadgt in this chapter became completely free from all doubts and accepted ka as the supreme personality of godhead he at once boldly declares you are parambrahma the supreme personality of godhead and previously ka states that he is the originator of everything and everyone every demigod and every human being is dependent on him men and demigods out of ignorance think that they are absolute and independent of the supreme lord ka that ignorance is removed perfectly by the discharge of devotional service this is already explained in the previous verse by the lord now by his grace arjuna is accepting him as the supreme truth in concordance with the vedic injunction it is not because ka is an intimate friend of arjuna that he is flattering him by calling him the supreme personality of godhead the absolute truth whatever arjuna says in these two verses is confirmed by vedic truth vedic injunctions affirm that only one who takes to devotional service to the supreme lord can understand him whereas others cannot each and every word of this verse spoken by arjuna is confirmed by vedic injunction in the kena upaniad it is stated that the supreme brahman is the rest for everything and ka has already explained that everything is resting on him the muaka upaniad confirms that the supreme lord in whom everything is resting can be realized only by those who engage constantly in thinking of him this constant thinking of ka is smaraam one of the methods of devotional service it is only by devotional service to ka that one can understand his position and get rid of this material body in the vedas the supreme lord is accepted as the purest of the pure one who understands that ka is the purest of the pure can become purified from all sinful activities one cannot be disinfected from sinful activities unless he surrenders unto the supreme lord arjunas acceptance of ka as the supreme pure complies with the injunctions of vedic literature this is also confirmed by great personalities of whom nrada is the chief ka is the supreme personality of godhead and one should always meditate upon him and enjoy ones transcendental relationship with him he is the supreme existence he is free from bodily needs birth and death not only does arjuna confirm this but all the vedic literatures the puras and histories in all vedic literatures ka is thus described and the supreme lord himself also says in the fourth chapter although i am unborn i appear on this earth to establish religious principles he is the supreme origin he has no cause for he is the cause of all causes and everything is emanating from him this perfect knowledge can be had by the grace of the supreme lord here arjuna expresses himself through the grace of ka if we want to understand bhagavadgt we should accept the statements in these two verses this is called the parampar system acceptance of the disciplic succession unless one is in the disciplic succession he cannot understand bhagavadgt it is not possible by socalled academic education unfortunately those proud of their academic education despite so much evidence in vedic literatures stick to their obstinate conviction that ka is an ordinary person text 14 sarvam etad ta manye yan m vadasi keava na hi te bhagavan vyakti vidur dev na dnav sarvamall etatthese tamtruths manyeaccept yatwhich mm unto me vadasiyou tell keavao ka nanever hi certainly te your bhagavano personality of godhead vyaktim revelation vidu can know devathe demigods nanor dnav the demons translation o ka i totally accept as truth all that you have told me neither the gods nor demons o lord know thy personality purport arjuna herein confirms that persons of faithless and demonic nature cannot understand ka he is not even known by the demigods so what to speak of the socalled scholars of this modern world by the grace of the supreme lord arjuna has understood that the supreme truth is ka and that he is the perfect one one should therefore follow the path of arjuna he received the authority of bhagavadgt as described in the fourth chapter the parampar system of disciplic succession for the understanding of bhagavadgt was lost and therefore ka reestablished that disciplic succession with arjuna because he considered arjuna his intimate friend and a great devotee therefore as stated in our introduction to gtopaniad bhagavadgt should be understood in the parampar system when the parampar system was lost arjuna was again selected to rejuvenate it the acceptance of arjuna of all that ka says should be emulated then we can understand the essence of bhagavadgt and then only can we understand that ka is the supreme personality of godhead text 15 svayam evtmantmna vettha tva puruottama bhtabhvana bhtea devadeva

of all demigods jagatpateo lord of the entire universe translation indeed you alone know yourself by your own potencies o origin of all lord of all beings god of gods o supreme person lord of the universe purport the supreme lord ka can be known by persons who are in a relationship with him through the discharge of devotional service like arjuna and his successors persons of demonic or atheistic mentality cannot know ka mental speculation that leads one away from the supreme lord is a serious sin and one who does not know ka should not try to comment on bhagavadgt bhagavadgt is the statement of ka and since it is the science of ka it should be understood from ka as arjuna understood it it should not be received from atheistic persons the supreme truth is realized in three aspects as impersonal brahman localized paramtm and at last as the supreme personality of godhead so at the last stage of understanding the absolute truth one comes to the supreme personality of godhead a liberated man and even a common man may realize impersonal brahman or localized paramtm yet they may not understand gods personality from the verses of bhagavadgt which are being spoken by this person ka sometimes the impersonalists accept ka as bhagavan or they accept his authority yet many liberated persons cannot understand ka as puruottama the supreme person the father of all living entities therefore arjuna addresses him as puruottama and if one comes to know him as the father of all the living entities still one may not know him as the supreme controller therefore he is addressed here as bhtea the supreme controller of everyone and even if one knows ka as the supreme controller of all living entities still one may not know that he is the origin of all the demigods therefore he is addressed herein as devadeva the worshipful god of all demigods and even if one knows him as the worshipful god of all demigods one may not know that he is the supreme proprietor of everything therefore he is addressed as jagatpati thus the truth about ka is established in this verse by the realization of arjuna and we should follow in the footsteps of arjuna to understand ka as he is text 16 vaktum arhasy aeea divy hy tmavibhtaya ybhir vibhtibhir lokn ims tva vypya tihasi vaktumto say arhasideserve aeeain detail divydivine hi certainly tmayourself vibhtayaopulences ybhiby

else a person may have through all these agencies and he has understood ka as the supreme personality of godhead for him there is no doubt yet he is asking ka to explain his allpervading nature so that in the future people will understand especially the impersonalists how he exists in his allpervading aspect through his different energies one should know that this is being asked by arjuna on behalf of the common people text 17 katha vidym aha yogis tv sad paricintayan keu keu ca bhveu cintyo si bhagavan may kathamhow vidym ahamshall i know yogino supreme mystic tvmyou sadalways

contemplated o blessed lord purport as it is stated in the previous chapter the supreme personality of godhead is covered by his yogamy only surrendered souls and devotees can see him now arjuna is convinced that his friend ka is the supreme godhead but he wants to know the general process by which the allpervading lord can be understood by the common man no common man including the demons and atheists can know ka because he is guarded by his yogamy energy again these questions are asked by arjuna for their benefit the superior devotee is not only concerned for his own understanding but for the understanding of all mankind out of his mercy because he is a vaiava a devotee arjuna is opening the understanding for the common man as far as the allpervasiveness of the supreme is concerned he addresses ka specifically as yogin because r ka is the master of the yogamy energy by which he is covered and uncovered to the common man the common man who has no love for ka cannot always think of ka therefore he has to think materially arjuna is considering the mode of thinking of the materialistic persons of this world because materialists cannot understand ka spiritually they are advised to concentrate the mind on physical things and try to see how ka is manifested by physical representations text 18 vistaretmano yoga vibhti ca janrdana bhya kathaya tptir hi vato nsti me mtam vistareain

transcendental pastimes of ka who is glorified by vedic hymns those who have entered into a transcendental relationship with ka relish in every step descriptions of the pastimes of the lord thus arjuna is interested to hear about ka specifically how he remains as the allpervading supreme lord now as far as amtam nectar is concerned any narration or statement concerning ka is just like nectar and this nectar can be perceived by practical experience modern stories fiction and histories are different from the transcendental pastimes of the lord in that one will tire of hearing mundane stories but one never tires of hearing about ka it is for this reason only that the history of the whole universe is replete with references to the pastimes of the incarnations of godhead for instance the puras are histories of bygone ages that relate the pastimes of the various incarnations of the lord in this way the reading matter remains forever fresh despite repeated readings text 19 r bhagavn

you of my splendorous manifestations but only of those which are prominent o arjuna for my opulence is limitless purport it is not possible to comprehend the greatness of ka and his opulences the senses of the individual soul are imperfect and do not permit him to understand the totality of kas affairs still the devotees try to understand ka but not on the principle that they will be able to understand ka fully at any specific time or in any state of life rather the very topics of ka are so relishable that they appear to them as nectar thus they enjoy them in discussing kas opulences and his diverse energies the pure devotees take transcendental pleasure therefore they want to hear and discuss them ka knows that living entities do not understand the extent of his opulences he therefore agrees to state only the principal manifestations of his different energies the word prdhnyata principal is very important because we can understand only a few of the principal details of the supreme lord for his features are unlimited it is not possible to understand them all and vibhti as used in this verse refers to the opulences by which he controls the whole manifestation in the amarakoa dictionary it is stated that vibhti indicates an exceptional opulence the impersonalist or the pantheist cannot understand the exceptional opulences of the supreme lord nor the manifestations of his divine energy both in the material world and in the spiritual world his energies are distributed in every variety of manifestation now ka is describing what can be directly perceived by the common man thus part of his variegated energy is described in this way text 20 aham tm gukea sarvabhtayasthita aham di ca madhya ca bhtnm anta eva ca ahami tmsoul gukeao arjuna sarvabhtaall living

creatures i am the beginning the middle and the end of all beings purport in this verse arjuna is addressed as gukea which means one who has conquered the darkness of sleep for those who are sleeping in the darkness of ignorance it is not possible to understand how the supreme godhead manifests himself in the material and spiritual worlds thus this address by ka to arjuna is significant because arjuna is above such darkness the personality of godhead agrees to describe his various opulences ka first informs arjuna that he is the self or soul of the entire cosmic manifestation by dint of his primary expansion before the material creation the supreme lord by his plenary expansion accepts the purua incarnations and from him everything begins therefore he is tm the soul of the mahattattva the universal elements the total material energy is not the cause of the creation but actually the mahvisu enters into the mahattattva the total material energy he is the soul when mahviu enters into the manifested universes he again manifests himself as the supersoul in each and every entity we have experience that the personal body of the living entity exists due to the presence of the spiritual spark without the existence of the spiritual spark the body cannot develop similarly the material manifestation cannot develop unless the supreme soul of ka enters the supreme personality of godhead is existing as the supersoul in all manifested universes a description of the three puruaavatras is given in rmadbhgavatam the supreme personality of godhead manifests three features as kraodakay visu garbhodakay viu and krodakay viu in this material manifestation the supreme lord ka the cause of all causes lies down in the cosmic ocean as mahviu or kraodakay viu and therefore ka is the beginning of this universe the maintainer of the universal manifestation and the end of all the energy text 21 ditynm aha viur jyoti ravir aumn marcir marutm asmi nakatrm aha a ditynmof the dityas ahami am

worship it as one of their daily morning rituals amongst the demigods they also worship nrada who is considered the greatest devotee in the universe thus he is the representation of ka as a devotee the gandharva planet is filled with entities who sing beautifully and among them the best singer is citraratha amongst the perpetually living entities kapila is considered an incarnation of ka and his

entities of which there was a horse named uccairav another animal produced from the nectar was an elephant named airvata because these two animals were produced from nectar they have special significance and they are representatives of ka amongst the human beings the king is the representative of ka because ka is the maintainer of the universe and the kings who are appointed on account of their godly qualifications are maintainers of their kingdoms kings like mahrja yudhihira mahrja parkit and lord rma were all highly righteous kings who always thought of the citizens welfare in vedic literature the king is considered to be the representative of god in this age however with the corruption of the principles of religion monarchy decayed and is now finally abolished it is to be

represents kas power in kaloka in the spiritual sky there are cows which can be milked at any time and they give as much milk as one likes of course such cows do not exist in this material world but there is mention of them in kaloka the lord keeps many such cows which are called surabhi it is stated that the lord is engaged in herding the surabhi cows kandarpa is the sex desire for presenting good sons therefore kandarpa is the representative of ka sometimes sex is engaged in only for sense gratification such sex does not represent ka but sex for the generation of good children is called kandarpa and represents ka text 29 ananta csmi ngn varuo ydasm aham pitm aryam csmi yama sayamatm aham anantaananta caalso asmii am ngnmof all serpents varuathe demigod controlling the water ydasmof

of killers time is the ultimate because time kills everything time is the representative of ka because in due course of time there will be a great fire and everything will be annihilated among the

and of seasons i am flowerbearing spring purport it has already been explained by the lord that amongst all the vedas the smaveda is rich with beautiful songs played by the various demigods one of these songs is the bhatsma which has an exquisite melody and is sung at midnight in sanskrit there are definite rules that regulate poetry rhyme and meter are not written whimsically as in much modern poetry amongst the regulated poetry the gyatr mantra which is chanted by the duly qualified brhmaas is the most prominent the gyatr mantra is mentioned in the rmadbhgavatam because the gyatr mantra isespecially meant for god realization it represents the supreme lord this mantra is meant for spiritually advanced people and when one attains success in chanting it he can enter into the transcendental position of the lord one must first acquire the qualities of the perfectly situated person the qualities of goodness according to the laws of material nature in order to chant the gyatr mantra the gyatr mantra is very important in vedic civilization and is considered to be the sound incarnation of brahman brahm is its initiator and it is passed down from him in disciplic succession the months of november and december are considered the best of all months because in india grains are collected from the fields at this time and the people become very happy of course spring is a season universally liked because it is neither too hot nor too cold and the flowers and trees blossom and flourish in spring there are also many ceremonies commemorating kas pastimes therefore this is considered to be the most joyful of all seasons and it is the representative of the supreme lord ka text 36 dyta chalayatm asmi tejas tejasvinm aham jayo smi vyavasyo smi sattva sattvavatm aham

the universe of all cheating processes gambling stands supreme and therefore represents ka as the supreme ka can be more deceitful than any mere man if ka chooses to deceive a person no one can surpass him in his deceit his greatness is not simply onesidedit is allsided among the victorious he is victory he is the splendor of the splendid among enterprising industrialists he is the most enterprising among adventurers he is the most adventurous and among the strong he is the strongest when ka was present on earth no one could surpass him in strength even in his childhood he lifted

amongst the sons of pu arjuna is famous and valiant indeed he is the best of men and therefore represents ka among the munis or learned men conversant in vedic knowledge vysa is the greatest because he explained vedic knowledge in many different ways for the understanding of the common mass of people in this age of kali and vysa is also known as an incarnation of ka therefore vysa also represents ka kavis are those who are capable of thinking thoroughly on any subject matter among the kavis uan was the spiritual master of the demons he was extremely intelligent farseeing political and

cut down the miscreants when miscreants are punished the rod of chastisement represents ka among those who are trying to be victorious in some field of activity the most victorious element is morality among the confidential activities of hearing thinking and meditating silence is most important because by silence one can make progress very quickly the wise man is he who can discriminate between

in various ways there is no limit to such opulences therefore not all the opulences and energies can be explained simply a few examples are being described to arjuna to pacify his inquisitiveness text

tavayou arjunao arjuna viabhyaentire ahami idamthis ktsnamall manifestations ekaone aenapart sthitha situated jagatin the universe translation but what need is there arjuna for all this detailed knowledge with a single fragment of myself i pervade and support this entire universe purport the supreme lord is represented throughout the entire material universes by his entering into all things as the supersoul the lord here tells arjuna that there is no point in understanding how things exist in their separate opulence and grandeur he should know that all things are existing due to kas entering them as supersoul from brahm the most gigantic entity on down to the smallest ant all are existing because the lord has entered each and all and is sustaining them worship of demigods is discouraged herein because even the greatest demigods like brahm and iva only represent part of the opulence of the supreme lord he is the origin of everyone born and no one is greater than him he is samat which means that no one is superior to him and that no one is equal to him in the viumantra it is said that one who considers the supreme lord ka in the same category with demigods be they even brahm or ivabecomes at once an atheist if however one thoroughly studies the different descriptions of the opulences and expansions of kas energy then one can understand without any doubt the position of lord r ka and can fix his mind in the worship of ka without deviation the lord is allpervading by the expansion of his partial representation the supersoul who enters into everything that is pure devotees therefore concentrate their minds in ka consciousness in full devotional service therefore they are always situated in the transcendental position devotional service and worship of ka are very clearly indicated in this chapter in verses eight to eleven that is the way of pure devotional service how one can attain the highest devotional perfection of association with the supreme personality of godhead has been thoroughly explained in this chapter thus end the bhaktivedanta purports to the tenth chapter of the rmadbhagavadgt in the matter of the opulence of the absolute chapter eleven the universal form text 1 arjuna uvca madanugrahya parama guhyam adhytmasajitam yat tvayokta vacas tena moho ya vigato mama arjuna uvcaarjuna said matanugrahyajust to show me favor

have heard your instruction on confidential spiritual matters which you have so kindly delivered unto me and my illusion is now dispelled purport this chapter reveals ka as the cause of all causes he is even the cause of the mahviu and from him the material universes emanate ka is not an incarnation he is the source of all incarnations that has been completely explained in the last chapter now as far as arjuna is concerned he says that his illusion is over this means that arjuna no longer thinks of ka as a mere human being as a friend of his but as the source of everything arjuna is very enlightened and is glad that he has a great friend like ka but now he is thinking that although he may accept ka as the source of everything others may not so in order to establish kas divinity for all he is requesting ka in this chapter to show his universal form actually when one sees the universal form of ka one becomes frightened like arjuna but ka is so kind that after showing it he converts himself again into his original form arjuna agrees to what ka says several times ka is speaking to him just for his benefit and arjuna acknowledges that all this is happening to him by kas grace he is now convinced that ka is the cause of all causes and is present in everyones heart as the supersoul text 2 bhavpyayau hi bhtn rutau vistarao may tvatta kamalapatrka mhtmyam api cvyayam

avyayaminexhaustible translation o lotuseyed one i have heard from you in detail about the appearance and disappearance of every living entity as realized through your inexhaustible glories purport arjuna addresses lord ka as lotuseyed kas eyes appear just like the petals of a lotus flower out of his joy for ka has assured him in the last verse of the previous chapter that he sustains the entire universe with just a fragment of himself he is the source of everything in this material manifestation and arjuna has heard of this from the lord in detail arjuna further knows that in spite of his being the source of all appearances and disappearances he is aloof from them his personality is not lost although he is allpervading that is the inconceivable opulence of ka which arjuna admits that he has thoroughly understood text 3 evam etad yathttha tvam tmna paramevara draum icchmi te rpam aivara puruottama evamthat etatthis yathtthaas it is tvamyou tmnamthe soul paramevarathe supreme lord

yet wish to see how you have entered into this cosmic manifestation i want to see that form of yours purport the lord said that because he entered into the material universe by his personal representation the cosmic manifestation has been made possible and is going on now as far as arjuna is concerned he is inspired by the statements of ka but in order to convince others in the future who may think that ka is an ordinary person he desires to see him actually in his universal form to see how he is acting from within the universe although he is apart from it arjunas asking the lords permission is also significant since the lord is the supreme personality of godhead he is present within arjuna himself therefore he knows the desire of arjuna and he can understand that arjuna has no special desire to see him in his universal form for he is completely satisfied to see him in his personal form of ka but he can understand also that arjuna wants to see the universal form to convince others he did not have any personal desire for confirmation ka also understands that arjuna wants to see the universal form to set a criterion for in the future there would be so many imposters who would pose themselves as incarnations of god the people therefore should be careful one who claims to be ka should be prepared to show his universal form to confirm his claim to the people text 4

kindly show me that universal self purport it is said that one can neither see hear understand nor perceive the supreme lord ka by the material senses but if one is engaged in loving transcendental service to the lord from the beginning then one can see the lord by revelation every living entity is only a spiritual spark therefore it is not possible to see or to understand the supreme lord arjuna as a devotee does not depend on his speculative strength rather he admits his limitations as a living entity and acknowledges kas inestimable position arjuna could understand that for a living entity it is not possible to understand the unlimited infinite if the infinite reveals himself then it is possible to understand the nature of the infinite by the grace of the infinite the word yogevara is also very significant here because the lord has inconceivable power if he likes he can reveal himself by his grace although he is unlimited therefore arjuna pleads for the inconceivable grace of ka he does not give ka orders ka is not obliged to reveal himself to anyone unless one surrenders fully in ka consciousness and engages in devotional service thus it is not possible for persons who depend on the strength of their mental speculations to see ka text 5 r bhagavn uvca paya me prtha rpi atao tha sahasraa nnvidhni divyni nnvarktni ca r bhagavn uvcathe supreme personality

blessed lord said my dear arjuna o son of pth behold now my opulences hundreds of thousands of varied divine forms multicolored like the sea purport arjuna wanted to see ka in his universal form which although a transcendental form is just manifested for the cosmic manifestation and is therefore subject to the temporary time of this material nature as the material nature is manifested and not manifested similarly this universal form of ka is manifested and unmanifested it is not eternally situated in the spiritual sky like kas other forms as far as a devotee is concerned he is not eager to see the universal form but because arjuna wanted to see ka in this way ka reveals this form this universal form is not possible to be seen by any ordinary man ka must give one the power to see it text

of ka and the most advanced of learned men it was still not possible for him to know everything about ka here it is stated that humans have neither heard nor known of all these forms and manifestations now ka reveals these wonderful forms text 7 ihaikastha jagat ktsna paydya sacarcaram mama dehe gukea yac cnyad draum icchasi ihain this ekasthamin one jagatthe universe ktsnam

therefore i give to you divine eyes by which you can behold my mystic opulence purport a pure devotee does not like to see ka in any form except his form with two hands a devotee must see his universal form by his grace not with the mind but with spiritual eyes to see the universal form of ka arjuna is told not to change his mind but his vision the universal form of ka is not very important that will be clear in the verses yet because arjuna wanted to see it the lord gives him the particular vision required to see that universal form devotees who are correctly situated in a transcendental relationship with ka are attracted by loving features not by a godless display of opulences the playmates of ka the friends of ka and the parents of ka never want ka to show his opulences they are so immersed in pure love that they do not even know that ka is the supreme personality of godhead in their loving exchange they forget that ka is thesupreme lord in the rmadbhgavatam it is stated that the boys who play with ka are all highly pious souls and after many many births they are able to play with ka such boys do not know that ka is the supreme personality of godhead they take him as a personal friend the supreme person is considered as the impersonal brahman by great sages as the supreme personality of godhead by the devotees and as a product of this material nature by ordinary men the fact is that the devotee is not concerned to see the vivarpa the universal form but arjuna wanted to see it to substantiate kas statement so that in the future people could understand that ka not only theoretically or philosophically presented himself as the supreme but actually presented himself as such to arjuna arjuna must confirm this because arjuna is the beginning of the parampar system those who are actually interested to understand the supreme personality of godhead ka and who follow in the footsteps of arjuna should understand that ka not only theoretically presented himself as the supreme but actually revealed himself as the supreme the lord gave arjuna the necessary power to see his universal form because he knew that arjuna did not particularly want to see it as we have already explained text 9 sajaya uvca evam uktv tato rjan mahyogevaro hari daraymsa prthya parama rpam aivaram sajaya uvcasanjaya said evamthus uktvsaying tata

indescribable yet sajaya is trying to give a mental picture of that great revelation to dhtarra neither sajaya nor dhtarra were present but sajaya by the grace of vysa could see whatever happened thus

pavaarjuna tadat that time translation at that time arjuna could see in the universal form of the lord the unlimited expansions of the universe situated in one place although divided into many many thousands purport the word tatra there is very significant it indicates that both arjuna and ka were sitting on the chariot when arjuna saw the universal form others on the battlefield could not see this form because ka gave the vision only to arjuna arjuna could see in the body of ka many thousands of universes as we learn from vedic scriptures there are many universes and many planets some of them are made of earth some are made of gold some are made of jewels some are very great some are not so great etc sitting on his chariot arjuna could see all these universes but no one could understand what was going on between arjuna and ka text 14 tata sa vismayvio harom dhanajaya praamya iras deva ktjalir abhata tatathereafter sahe vismayviabeing overwhelmed with wonder haromwith his

say translation then bewildered and astonished his hair standing on end arjuna began to pray with folded hands offering obeisances to the supreme lord purport once the divine vision is revealed the relationship between ka and arjuna changes immediately before ka and arjuna had a relationship based on friendship but here after the revelation arjuna is offering obeisances with great respect and with folded hands he is praying to ka he is praising the universal form thus arjunas relationship becomes one of wonder rather than friendship great devotees see ka as the reservoir of all relationships in the scriptures there are twelve basic kinds of relationships mentioned and all of them are present in ka it is said that he is the ocean of all the relationships exchanged between two living entities between the gods or between the supreme lord and his devotees it is said that arjuna was inspired by the relationship of wonder and in that wonder although he was by nature very sober calm and quiet he became ecstatic his hair stood up and he began to offer his obeisances unto the supreme lord with folded hands he was not of course afraid he was affected by the wonders of the supreme lord the immediate context is wonder his natural loving friendship was overwhelmed by wonder and thus he reacted in this way text 15 arjuna uvca paymi devs tava deva dehe sarvs tath

arjuna sees everything in the universe therefore he sees brahm who is the first creature in the universe and the celestial serpent upon which the garbhodakay viu lies in the lower regions of the universe this snake bed is called vsuki there are also other snakes known as vsuki arjuna can see from the garbhodakay viu up to the topmost part of the universe on the lotusflower planet where brahm

that arjuna will emerge victorious in battle despite heavy losses on both sides it is also mentioned here that bhma who is supposed to be unconquerable will also be smashed so also kara not only will

avasthitsituated pratyankeuon the opposite side yodhthe soldiers translation the blessed lord said time i am destroyer of the worlds and i have come to engage all people with the exception of you the pavas all the soldiers here on both sides will be slain purport although arjuna knew that ka was his friend and the supreme personality of godhead he was nonetheless puzzled by the various forms exhibited by ka therefore he asked further about the actual mission of this devastating force it is written in the vedas that the supreme truth destroys everything even brahm yasya brahme ca katram ca ubhe bhavata odanamtyur yasyopasecana ka itth veda yatra sa eventually all the brhmaas katriyas and everyone else are devoured by the supreme this form of the supreme lord is an alldevouring giant and here ka presents himself in that form of alldevouring time except for a few pavas everyone who was present in that battlefield would be devoured by him arjuna was not in favor of the fight and he thought it was better not to fight then there would be no frustration in reply the lord is saying that even if he did not fight every one of them would be destroyed for that is his plan if he stopped fighting they would die in another way death cannot be checked even if he did not fight in fact they were already dead time is destruction and all manifestations are to be vanquished by the desire of the supreme lord that is the law of nature text 33 tasmt tvam uttiha yao labhasva jitv atrn bhukva rjya samddham mayaivaite nihat prvam eva nimittamtra bhava savyascin tasmttherefore tvmyou uttihaget

death by my arrangement and you o savyascin can be but an instrument in the fight purport savyascin refers to one who can shoot arrows very expertly in the field thus arjuna is addressed as an expert warrior capable of delivering arrows to kill his enemies just become an instrument nimittamtram this word is also very significant the whole world is moving according to the plan of the supreme personality of godhead foolish persons who do not have sufficient knowledge think that nature is moving without a plan and all manifestations are but accidental formations there are many socalled scientists who suggest that perhaps it was like this or maybe like that but there is no question of perhaps and maybe there is a specific plan being carried out in this material world what is this plan this cosmic manifestation is a chance for the conditioned souls to go back to godhead back to home as long they have the domineering mentality which makes them try to lord it over material nature they are conditioned but anyone who can understand the plan of the supreme lord and cultivate ka consciousness is most intelligent the creation and destruction of the cosmic manifestation are under the superior guidance of god thus the battle of kuruketra was fought according to the plan of god arjuna was refusing to fight but he was told that he should fight and at the same time desire the supreme lord then he would be happy if one is in full ka consciousness and if his life is devoted to his transcendental service he is perfect text 34 droa ca bhma ca jayadratha ca kara tathnyn api

and merciful to his devotees that he wants to give the credit to his devotees who carry out his plan according to his desire life should therefore move in such a way that everyone acts in ka consciousness and understands the supreme personality of godhead through the medium of a spiritual master the plans of the supreme personality of godhead are understood by his mercy and the plans of the devotees are as good as his plans one should follow such plans and be victorious in the struggle for existence text 35 sajaya uvca etac chrutv vacana keavasya ktjalir vepamna kirt namasktv bhya

arjuna trembled fearfully offered obeisances with folded hands and began falteringly to speak as follows purport as we have already explained because of the situation created by the universal form of the supreme personality of godhead arjuna became bewildered in wonder thus he began to offer his respectful obeisances to ka again and again and with faltering voice he began to pray not as a friend but as a devotee in wonder text 36 arjuna uvca sthne hkea tava prakrty jagat prahyaty anurajyate ca raksi bhtni dio dravanti sarve namasyanti ca siddhasagh arjuna uvcaarjuna said sthnerightly hkeao

beings offer you their respectful homage the demons are afraid and they flee here and there all this is rightly done purport arjuna after hearing from ka about the outcome of the battle of kuruketra became an enlightened devotee of the supreme lord he admitted that everything done by ka is quite fit arjuna confirmed that ka is the maintainer and the object of worship for the devotees and the destroyer of the undesirables his actions are equally good for all arjuna understood herein that when the battle of kuruketra was being concluded in outer space there were present many demigods siddhas and the intelligentia of the higher planets and they were observing the fight because ka was present there when arjuna saw the universal form of the lord the demigods took pleasure in it but others who were demons and atheists could not stand it when the lord was praised out of their natural fear of the devastating form of the supreme personality of godhead they fled kas treatment of the devotees and the atheists is praised by arjuna in all cases a devotee glorifies the lord because he knows that whatever he does is good for all text 37 kasmc ca te na nameran mahtman garyase brahmao

translation o great one who stands above even brahm you are the original master why should they not offer their homage up to you o limitless one o refuge of the universe you are the invincible source the cause of all causes transcendental to this material manifestation purport by this offering of obeisances arjuna indicates that ka is worshipable by everyone he is allpervading and he is the soul of every soul arjuna is addressing ka as mahtm which means that he is most magnanimous and unlimited ananta indicates that there is nothing which is not covered by the influence and energy of the supreme lord and devea means that he is the controller of all demigods and is above them all he is the center of the whole universe arjuna also thought that it was fitting that all the perfect living entities and all powerful demigods offer their respectful obeisances unto him because no one is greater than him he especially mentions that ka is greater than brahm because brahm is created by him brahm is born out of the lotus stem grown from the navel abdomen of garbhodakay viu who is kas plenary expansion therefore brahm and lord iva who is born of brahm and all other demigods must offer their respectful obeisances thus the lord is respected by lord iva and brahm and similar other demigods the word akaram is very significant because this material creation is subject to destruction but the lord is above this material creation he is the cause of all causes and being so he is superior to all the conditioned souls within this material nature as well as the material cosmic manifestation itself he is therefore the allgreat supreme text 38 tvam dideva purua puras tvam asya vivasya para nidhnam vettsi vedya ca para ca dhma tvay tata vivam anantarpa tvamyou didevathe original supreme god

representation of all the demigods being allpervasive arjuna also addresses ka as the grandfather because he is the father of brahm the first living creature in the universe text 40 nama purastd atha

many times while relaxing or while lying on the same bed or eating together sometimes alone and sometimes in front of many friends please excuse me for all my offenses purport although ka is manifested before arjuna in his universal form arjuna remembers his friendly relationship with ka and is therefore asking pardon and requesting him to excuse him for the many informal gestures which arise out of friendship he is admitting that formerly he did not know that ka could assume such a universal form although he explained it as his intimate friend arjuna did not know how many times he may have dishonored him by addressing him as o my friend o ka o ydava etc without acknowledging his opulence but ka is so kind and merciful that in spite of such opulence he played with arjuna as a friend such is the transcendental loving reciprocation between the devotee and the lord the relationship between the living entity and ka is fixed eternally it cannot be forgotten as we can see from the behavior of arjuna although arjuna has seen the opulence in the universal form he could not forget his friendly relationship with ka text 43 pitsi lokasya carcarasya tvam asya pjya ca gurur garyn

you are the father of this complete cosmic manifestation the worshipable chief the spiritual master no one is equal to you nor can anyone be one with you within the three worlds you are immeasurable purport the lord ka is worshipable as a father is worshipable for his son he is the spiritual master because he originally gave the vedic instructions to brahm and presently he is also instructing bhagavadgt to arjuna therefore he is the original spiritual master and any bona fide spiritual master at the present moment must be a descendant in the line of disciplic succession stemming from ka without being a representative of ka one cannot become a teacher or spiritual master of transcendental subject matter the lord is being paid obeisances in all respects he is of immeasurable greatness no one can be greater than the supreme personality of godhead ka because no one is equal to or higher than ka within any manifestation spiritual or material everyone is below him no one can excel him the supreme lord ka has senses and a body like the ordinary man but for him there is no difference between his senses body mind and himself foolish persons who do not know him perfectly say that ka is different from his soul mind heart and everything else ka is absolute therefore his activities and potencies are supreme it is also stated that he does not have senses like ours he can perform all sensual activities therefore his senses are neither imperfect nor limited no one can be greater than him no one can be equal to him and everyone is lower than him whoever knows his transcendental body activities and perfection after quitting his body returns to him and doesnt come back again to this miserable world therefore one should know that kas activities are different from others the best policy is to follow the principles of ka that will make one perfect it is also stated that there is no one who is master of ka everyone is his servant only ka is god and everyone is servant everyone is complying with his order there is no one who can deny his order everyone is acting according to his direction being under his superintendence as stated in the brahmsahit he is the cause of all causes text 44 tasmt praamya praidhya kya prasdaye tvm aham am yam piteva putrasya sakheva sakhyu priya priyyrhasi deva sohum tasmttherefore praamyaafter offering obeisances praidhya laying down

relationships one might treat ka as a son one might treat ka as a husband as a friend as a master etc ka and arjuna are related in friendship as the father tolerates or the husband or master tolerates so ka tolerates text 45 adaprva hito smi dv bhayena ca pravyathita mano me tad eva me daraya deva rpa prasda devea jagannivsa adaprvamnever seen before hitagladdened asmii am dvby seeing bhayenaout of

universe translation after seeing this universal form which i have never seen before i am gladdened but at the same time my mind is disturbed with fear therefore please bestow your grace upon me and reveal again your form as the personality of godhead o lord of lords o abode of the universe purport arjuna is always in confidence with ka because he is a very dear friend and as a dear friend is gladdened by his friends opulence arjuna is very joyful to see that his friend ka is the supreme personality of godhead and can show such a wonderful universal form but at the same time after seeing that universal form he is afraid that he has committed so many offenses to ka out of his unalloyed friendship thus his mind is disturbed out of fear although he had no reason to fear arjuna therefore is asking ka to show his nryaa form because he can assume any form this universal form is material and temporary as the material world is temporary but in the vaikuha planets he has his transcendental form with four hands as nryaa there are innumerable planets in the spiritual sky and in each of them ka is present by his plenary manifesttations of different names thus arjuna desired to see one of the forms manifest in the vaikuha planets of course in each vaikuha planet the form of nryaa is fourhanded and the four hands hold different symbols the conchshell mace lotus and disc according to the different hands these four things are held in the nryaas are named all of these forms are one and the same to ka therefore arjuna requests to see his four handed feature text 46 kirina gadina

fourarmed form with helmeted head and with club wheel conch and lotus flower in your hands i long to see you in that form purport in the brahmsahit it isstated that the lord is eternally situated in hundreds and thousands of forms and the main forms are those like rma nsiha nryaa etc there are innumerable forms but arjuna knew that ka is the original personality of godhead assuming his temporary universal form he is now asking to see the form of nryaa a spiritual form this verse establishes without any doubt the statement of the rmadbhgavatam that ka is the original personality of godhead and all other features originate from him he is not different from his plenary expansions and he is god in any of his innumerable forms in all of these forms he is fresh like a young man that is the constant feature of the supreme personality of godhead one who knows ka at once becomes free from all contamination of the material world text 47 r bhagavn uvca may prasannena tavrjuneda rpa para

of effulgence and opulence this form was glaring like the sun and its many faces were rapidly changing ka showed this form just to satisfy the desire of his friend arjuna this form was manifested by ka through his internal potency which is inconceivable by human speculation no one had seen this universal form of the lord before arjuna but because the form was shown to arjuna other devotees in the heavenly planets and in other planets in outer space could also see it they did not see it before but because of arjuna they were also able to see it in other words all the disciplic devotees of the lord could see the universal form which was shown to arjuna by the mercy of ka someone commented that this form was shown to duryodhana also when ka went to duryodhana to negotiate for peace unfortunately duryodhana did not accept the peace offer but at that time ka manifested some of his universal forms but those forms are different from this one shown to arjuna it is clearly said that no one has ever seen this form before text 48 na vedayajdhyayanair na dnair na ca kriybhir na tapobhir ugrai eva rpa akya aha nloke drau tvadanyena kurupravra nanever vedavedic study yajasacrifice

vedas nor by performing sacrifices nor by charities or similar activities can this form be seen only you have seen this purport the divine vision in this connection should be clearly understood who can have divine vision divine means godly unless one attains the status of divinity as a demigod he cannot have divine vision and what is a demigod it is stated in the vedic scriptures that those who are devotees of lord viu are demigods those who are atheistic ie who do not believe in viu or who only recognize the impersonal part of ka as the supreme cannot have the divine vision it is not possible to decry ka and at the same time have the divine vision one cannot have the divine vision without becoming divine in other words those who have divine vision can also see like arjuna the bhagavadgt gives the description of the universal form and this description was unknown to everyone before arjuna now one can have some idea of the vivarpa after this incidence those who are actually divine can see the universal form of the lord but one cannot be divine without being a pure devotee of ka the devotees however who are actually in the divine nature and who have divine vision are not very much interested to see the universal form of the lord as described in the previous verse arjuna desired to see the fourhanded form of lord ka as viu and he was actually afraid of the universal form in this verse there are some significant words just like vedayajdhyayanai which refers to studying vedic literature and the subject matter of sacrificial regulations veda refers to all kinds of vedic literature namely the four vedas k yajus sma and atharva and the eighteen puras and upaniads and vedntastra one can study these at home or anywhere else similarly there are stras kalpastras and mmsstras for studying the method of sacrifice dnai refers to charity which is offered to a suitable party such as those who are engaged in the transcenddental loving service of the lord the brhmaas and the vaiavas similarly pious activities refer to the agnihotra etc the prescribed duties of the different castes pious activities and the voluntary acceptance of some bodily pains are called tapasya so one can perform all these can accept bodily penances give charity study the vedas etc but unless he is a devotee like arjuna it is not possible to see that universal form those who are impersonalists are also imagining that they are seeing the universal form of the lord but from bhagavadgt we understand that the impersonalists are not devotees therefore they are unable to see the universal form of the lord there are many persons who create incarnations they falsely claim an ordinary human to be an incarnation but this is all foolishness we should follow the principles of bhagavadgt otherwise there is no possibility of attaining perfect spiritual knowledge although bhagavadgt isconsidered the preliminary study of the science of god still it is so perfect that one can distinguish what is what the followers of a pseudo incarnation may say that they have also seen the transcendental incarnation of god the universal form but that is not acceptable because it is clearly stated here that unless one becomes a devotee of ka one cannot see the universal form of god so one first of all has to become a pure devotee of ka then he can claim that he can show the universal form of what he has seen a devotee of ka cannot accept false incarnations or followers of false incarnations text 49 m te vyath m ca vimhabhvo dv rpa ghoram d mamedam vyapetabh prtaman punas

feature of mine now let it be finished my devotee be free from all disturbance with a peaceful mind you can now see the form you desire purport in the beginning of bhagavadgt arjuna was worried about killing bhma and droa his worshipful grandfathers and masters but ka said that he need not be afraid of killing his grandfather when they tried to disrobe draupad in the assembly bhma and droa were silent and for such negligence of duty they should be killed ka showed his universal form to arjuna just to show him that these people were already killed for their unlawful action that scene was shown to arjuna because devotees are always peaceful and they cannot perform such horrible actions the purpose of the revelation of the universal form was shown now arjuna wanted to see the fourarmed form and ka showed him a devotee is not much interested in the universal form for it does not enable one to reciprocate loving feelings a devotee wants to offer his respectful worshiping feelings thus he wants to see the twohanded or fourhanded ka form so he can reciprocate in loving service with the supreme personality of godhead text 50 sajaya uvca ity arjuna vsudevas tathoktv svaka rpa daraymsa

thus to arjuna displayed his real fourarmed form and at last he showed him his twoarmed form thus encouraging the fearful arjuna purport when ka appeared as the son of vasudeva and devak he first of all appeared as fourarmed nryaa but when he was requested by his parents he transformed himself into an ordinary child in appearance similarly ka knew that arjuna was not interested in seeing a fourhanded form of ka but since he asked to see this fourhanded form he also showed him this form again and then showed himself in his twohanded form the word saumya vapu is very significant saumyavapu is a very beautiful form it is known as the most beautiful form when he was present everyone was attracted simply by kas form and because ka is director of the universe he just banished the fear of arjuna his devotee and showed him again his beautiful form of ka in the brahma sahit it is stated that only a person whose eyes are smeared with the ointment of love can see the beautiful form of r ka text 51 arjuna uvca dveda mnua rpa tava saumya janrdana idnm asmi savtta sacet prakti gata arjuna uvcaarjuna said dvseeing idamthis mnuam human being rpamform tavayour saumyamvery beautiful

humanlike form so very beautiful my mind is now pacified and i am restored to my original nature purport here the words mnua rpam clearly indicate the supreme personality of godhead to be originally twohanded those who deride ka to be an ordinary person are shown here to be ignorant of his divine nature if ka is like an ordinary human being then how is it possible for him to show the universal form and again to show the fourhanded nryaa form so it is very clearly stated in bhagavadgt that one who thinks that ka is an ordinary person and misguides the reader by claiming that it is the impersonal brahman within ka speaking is doing the greatest injustice ka has actually shown his universal form and his fourhanded viu form so how can he be an ordinary human being a pure devotee is not confused by misguiding commentaries on bhagavad gt because he knows what is what the original verses of bhagavadgt are as clear as the sun they do not require lamplight from foolish commentators

arjuna the form which you are now seeing is very difficult to behold even the demigods are ever seeking the opportunity to see this form which is so dear purport in the fortyeighth verse of this chapter lord ka concluded revealing his universal form and informed arjuna that this form is not possible to be seen by so many activities sacrifices etc now here the word sudurdaram isused indicating that kas twohanded form is still more confidential one may be able to see the universal form of ka by adding a little tinge of devotional service to various activities like penance vedic study and philosophical speculation etc it may be possible but without a tinge of bhakti one cannot see that has already been explained still beyond that universal form the form of ka as a twohanded man is still more difficult to see even for demigods like brahm and lord iva they desire to see him and we have evidences in the rmad bhgavatam that when he was supposed to be in the womb of his mother devak all the demigods from heaven came to see the marvel of ka they even waited to see him a foolish person may deride him but that is an ordinary person ka is actually desired to be seen by demigods like brahm and iva in his twoarmed form in bhagavadgt it is also confirmed that he is not visible to the foolish persons who deride him kas body as confirmed by brahmsahit and confirmed by himself in bhagavadgt iscompletely spiritual and full of bliss and eternality his body is never like a material body but for some who make a study of ka by reading bhagavadgt or similar vedic scriptures ka is a problem for one using a material process ka is considered to be a great historical personality and very learned philosopher but he isnt an ordinary man but some think that even though he was so powerful he had to accept a material body ultimately they think that the absolute truth is impersonal therefore they think that from his impersonal feature he assumed a personal feature attached to material nature this is a materialistic calculation of the supreme lord another calculation is speculative those who are in search of knowledge also speculate on ka and consider him to be less important than the universal form of the supreme thus some think that the universal form of ka which was manifested to arjuna is more important than his personal form according to them the personal form of the supreme is something imaginary they believe that in the ultimate issue the absolute truth is not a person but the transcendental process is described in bhagavadgt chapter two to hear about ka from authorities that is the actual vedic process and those who are actually in the vedic line hear about ka from authority and by repeated hearing about him ka becomes dear as we have several times discussed ka is covered by his yogamy potency he is not to be seen or revealed to anyone and everyone only by one to whom he reveals himself can he be seen this is confirmed in vedic literature for one who is a surrendered soul the absolute truth can actually be understood the transcendentalist by continuous ka consciousness and by devotional service to ka can have his spiritual eyes opened and can see ka by revelation such a revelation is not possible even for the demigods therefore it is difficult even for the demigods to understand ka and the advanced demigods are always in hope of seeing ka in his twohanded form the conclusion is that although to see the universal form of ka is very very difficult and not possible for anyone and everyone it is still more difficult to understand his personal form as ymasundara text 53 nha vedair na tapas na dnena na cejyay akya evavidho drau davn asi m yath nanever ahami vedaiby study of the vedas nanever tapas by serious penances

transcendental eyes cannot be understood simply by studying the vedas nor by undergoing serious penances nor by charity nor by worship it is not by these means that one can see me as i am purport ka first appeared before his parents devak and vasudeva in a fourhanded form and then he transformed himself into the twohanded form this mystery is very difficult to understand for those who are atheists or who are devoid of devotional service for scholars who have simply studied vedic literature by way of speculation or out of mere academic interest ka is not easy to understand nor is he to he understood by persons who officially go to the temple to offer worship they make their visit but they cannot understand ka as he is ka can be understood only through the path of devotional service as explained by ka himself in the next verse text 54 bhakty tv ananyay akya aham evavidho rjuna jtu drau ca tattvena praveu ca parantapa bhaktyby devotional service tubut ananyaywithout being mixed with fruitive activities or speculative knowledge akyapossible ahami evamvidhalike this arjunao arjuna jtumto know draumto see tattvenain fact praveumand to enter into caalso parantapao mightyarmed one translation my dear arjuna only by undivided devotional service can i be understood as i am standing before you and can thus be seen directly only in this way can you enter into the mysteries of my understanding purport ka can be understood only by the process of undivided devotional service he explicitly explains this in this verse so unauthorized commentators who try to understand bhagavadgt by the speculative process will know that they are simply wasting their time no one can understand ka or how he came from parents in a fourhanded form and at once changed himself into a twohanded form it is clearly stated here that no one can see him those who however are very experienced students of vedic literature can learn about him from the vedic literature in so many ways there are so many rules and regulations and if one at all wants to understand ka he must follow the regulative principles described in the authoritative literature one can perform penance in accordance with those principles as far as charity is concerned it is plain that charity should be given to the devotees of ka who are engaged in his devotional service to spread the ka philosophy or ka consciousness throughout the world ka consciousness is a benediction to humanity lord caitanya was appreciated by rpa gosvm as the most munificent man of charity because love of ka which is very difficult to achieve was distributed freely by him and if one worships as prescribed in the temple in the temples in india there is always some statue usually of viu or ka that is a chance to progress for the beginners in devotional service to the lord temple worship is very essential and this is confirmed in the vedic literature one who has unflinching devotion for the supreme lord and is directed by the spiritual master can see the supreme personality of godhead by revelation for one who does not take personal training under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master it is impossible to even begin to understand ka the word tu is specifically used here to indicate that no other process can be used can be recommended or can be successful in understanding ka the personal forms of ka the twohanded form and the four handed are completely different from the temporary universal form shown to arjuna the fourhanded form is nryaa and the twohanded form is ka they are eternal and transcendental whereas the universal form exhibited to arjuna is temporary the very word sudurdaram meaning difficult to see suggests that no one saw that universal form it also suggests that amongst the devotees there was no necessity of showing it that form was exhibited by ka at the request of arjuna because in the future when one represents himself as an incarnation of god people can ask to see his universal form ka changes from the universal form to the fourhanded form of nryaa and then to his own natural form of two hands this indicates that the fourhanded forms and other forms mentioned in vedic literature are all emanations of the original twohanded ka he is the origin of all emanations ka is distinct even from these forms not to speak of the impersonal conception as far as the fourhanded forms of ka are concerned it is stated clearly that even the most identical fourhanded form of ka which is known as mahviu who is lying on the cosmic ocean and from whose breathing so many innumerable universes are passing out and entering is also an expansion of the supreme lord therefore one should conclusively worship the personal form of ka as the supreme personality of godhead who is eternity bliss and knowledge he is the source of all forms of viu he is the source of all forms of incarnation and he is the original supreme personality as confirmed in bhagavadgt in the vedic literature it is stated that the supreme absolute truth is a person his name is ka and he sometimes descends on this earth similarly inrmadbhgavatam there is a description of all kinds of incarnations of the supreme personality of godhead and there it is said that ka is not an incarnation of god but is the original supreme personality of godhead himself kas tu bhagavn svayam similarly in bhagavadgt the lord says matta parataram nnyt there is nothing superior to my form as the personality of godhead ka he also says elsewhere in bhagavadgt aham dir hi devnm i am the origin of all the demigods and after understanding bhagavadgt from ka arjuna also confirms this in the following words para brahma para dhma pavitra parama bhavn i now fully understand that you are the supreme personality of godhead the absolute truth and that you are the refuge of everything therefore the universal form which ka showed to arjuna is not the original form of god the original is the ka form the universal form with its thousands and thousands of heads and hands is manifest just to draw the attention of those who have no love for god it is not gods original form the universal form is not attractive for pure devotees who are in love with the lord in different transcendental relationships the supreme godhead exchanges transcendental love in his original form of ka therefore to arjuna who was so intimately related with ka in friendship this form of the universal manifestation was not pleasing rather it was fearful arjuna who is a constant companion of kas must have had transcendental eyes he was not an ordinary man therefore he was not captivated by the universal form this form may seem wonderful to persons who are involved in elevating themselves by fruitive activities but to persons who are engaged in devotional service the twohanded form of ka is the mostdear text 55 matkarmakn matparamo madbhakta sagavarjita nirvaira sarvabhteu ya sa mm eti pava matkarmaktengaged in doing my work

every living entity yaone who sahe mmunto me eticomes pavao son of pu translation my dear arjuna one who is engaged in my pure devotional service free from the contaminations of previous activities and from mental speculation who is friendly to every living entity certainly comes to me purport anyone who wants to approach the supreme of all the personalities of godhead on the kaloka planet in the spiritual sky and be intimately connected with the supreme personality ka must take this formula as is stated by the supreme himself therefore this verse is considered to be the essence of bhagavadgt the bhagavadgt isa book directed to the conditioned souls who are engaged in the material world with the purpose of lording it over nature and who do not know of the real spiritual life the bhagavadgt ismeant to show how one can understand his spiritual existence and his eternal relationship with the supreme spiritual personality and to teach one how to go back home back to godhead now here is the verse which clearly explains the process by which one can attain success in his spiritual activity devotional service as far as work is concerned one should transfer his energy entirely to ka conscious activities no work should be done by any man except in relationship to ka this called kakarma one may be engaged in various activities but one should not be attached to the result of his work but the result should be done for him for example one may be engaged in business but to transform that activity into ka consciousness one has to do business for ka if ka is the proprietor of the business then ka should enjoy the profit of the business if a businessman is in possession of thousands and thousands of dollars and if he has to offer all this to ka he can do it this is work for ka instead of constructing a big building for his sense gratification he can construct a nice temple for ka and he can install the deity of ka and arrange for the deitys service as is outlined in the authorized books of devotional service this is all kakarma one should not be attached to the result of his work but the result should be offered to ka one should also accept as prasdam food the remnants of offerings to ka if however one is not able to construct a temple for ka one can engage himself in cleansing the temple of ka that is also kakarma one can cultivate a garden anyone who has landin india at least any poor man has a certain amount of landcan utilize that for ka by growing flowers to offer him he can sow tulas plants because tulas leaves are very important and ka has recommended this in bhagavadgt ka desires that one offer him either a leaf or a flower or a little waterand he is satisfied this leaf especially refers to the tulas so one can sow tulas leaves and pour water on the plant thus even the poorest man can engage in the service of ka these are some of the examples of how one can engage in working for ka the word matparama refers to one who considers the association of ka in his supreme abode to be the highest perfection of life such a person does not wish to be elevated to the higher planets such as the moon or sun or heavenly planets or even the highest planet of this universe brahmaloka he has no attraction for that he is only attracted to being transferred to the spiritual sky and even in the spiritual sky he is not satisfied with merging into the glowing brahmajyoti effulgence for he wants to enter the highest spiritual planet namely kaloka goloka vndvana he has full knowledge of that planet and therefore he is not interested in any other as indicated by the word madbhakta he fully engages in devotional service specifically in the nine processes of devotional engagement hearing chanting remembering worshiping serving the lotus feet of the lord offering prayers carrying out the orders of the lord making friends with him and surrendering everything to him one can engage in all nine devotional processes or eight or seven or at least in one and that will surely make one perfect the term sagavarjita is very significant one should disassociate himself from persons who are against ka not only are the atheistic persons against ka but also those who are attracted to fruitive activities and mental speculation therefore the pure form of devotional service is described in bhaktirasmtasindhu as follows anybhilit nya jnakarmdyanvtam nuklyena knulana bhaktir uttam in this verse rla rpa gosvm clearly states that if anyone wants to execute unalloyed devotional service he must be freed from all kinds of material contamination he must be freed from the association of persons who are addicted to fruitive activities and mental speculation when freed from such unwanted association and from the contamination of material desires one favorably cultivates knowledge of ka that is called pure devotional service nuklyasya sakapla prtiklyasya varjanam one should think of ka and act for ka favorably not unfavorably kasa was an enemy of kas from the very beginning of kas birth he planned in so many ways to kill him and because he was always unsuccessful he was always thinking of ka thus while working while eating and while sleeping he was always ka conscious in every respect but that ka consciousness was not favorable and therefore in spite of his always thinking of ka twentyfour hours a day he was considered a demon and ka at last killed him of course anyone who is killed by ka attains salvation immediately but that is not the aim of the pure devotee the pure devotee does not even want salvation he does not want to be transferred even to the highest planet goloka vndvana his only objective is to serve ka wherever he may be a devotee of ka is friendly to everyone therefore it is said here that he has no enemy how is this a devotee situated in ka consciousness knows that only devotional service to ka can relieve a person from all the problems of life he has personal experience of this and therefore he wants to introduce this system ka consciousness into human society there are many examples in history of devotees of the lord risking their lives for the spreading of god consciousness the favorite example is lord jesus christ he was crucified by the nondevotees but he sacrificed his life for spreading god consciousness of course it would be superficial to understand that he was killed similarly in india also there are many examples such as hkur haridsa why such risk because they wanted to spread ka consciousness and it is difficult a ka conscious person knows that if a man is suffering it is due to his forgetfulness of his eternal relationship with ka therefore the highest benefit one can render to human society is relieving ones neighbor from all material problems in such a way a pure devotee is engaged in the service of the lord now we can imagine how merciful ka is to those engaged in his service risking everything for him therefore it is certain that such persons must reach the supreme planet after leaving the body in summary the universal form of ka which is a temporary manifestation and the form of time which devours everything and even the form of viu fourhanded have all been exhibited by ka thus ka is the origin of all these manifestations it is not that ka is a manifestation of the original vivarpa or viu ka is the origin of all forms there are hundreds and thousands of vius but for a devotee no form of ka is important but the original form twohanded ymasundara in the brahmsahit it is stated that those who are attached to the ymasundara form of ka in love and devotion can see him always within the heart and cannot see anything else one should understand therefore that the purport of this eleventh chapter is that the form of ka is essential and supreme thus end the bhaktivedanta purports to the eleventh chapter of the rmadbhagavadgt in the matter of the universal form chapter twelve devotional service text 1 arjuna uvca eva satatayukt ye

your devotional service or those who worship the impersonal brahman the unmanifested purport ka has now explained about the personal the impersonal and the universal and has described all kinds of devotees and yogs generally the transcendentalists can be divided into two classes one is the impersonalist and the other is the personalist the personalist devotee engages himself with all energy in the service of the supreme lord the impersonalist engages himself not directly in the service of ka but in meditation on the impersonal brahman the unmanifested we find in this chapter that of the different processes for realization of the absolute truth bhaktiyoga devotional service is the highest if one at all desires to have the association of the supreme personality of godhead then he must take to devotional service those who worship the supreme lord directly by devotional service are called personalists those who engage themselves in meditation on the impersonal brahman are called impersonalists arjuna is here questioning which position is better there are different ways to realize the absolute truth but ka indicates in this chapter that bhaktiyoga or devotional service to him is highest of all it is the most direct and it is the easiest means for association with the godhead in the second chapter the lord explains that a living entity is not the material body but is a spiritual spark a part of the absolute truth in the seventh chapter he speaks of the living entity as part and parcel of the supreme whole and recommends that he transfer his attention fully to the whole in the eighth chapter it is stated that whoever thinks of ka at the moment of death is at once transferred to the spiritual sky kas abode and at the end of the sixth chapter the lord says that out of all the yogs he who thinks of ka within himself is considered to be the most perfect so throughout the gt personal devotion to ka is recommended as the highest form of spiritual realization yet there are those who are still attracted to kas impersonal brahmajyoti effulgence which is the all pervasive aspect of the absolute truth and which is unmanifest and beyond the reach of the senses arjuna would like to know which of these two types of transcendentalists is more perfect in knowledge in other words he is clarifying his own position because he is attached to the personal form of ka he is not attached to the impersonal brahman he wants to know whether his position is secure the impersonal manifestation either in this material world or in the spiritual world of the supreme lord is a problem for meditation actually one cannot perfectly conceive of the impersonal feature of the absolute truth therefore arjuna wants to say what is the use of such a waste of time arjuna experienced in the eleventh chapter that to be attached to the personal form of ka is best because he could thus understand all other forms at the same time and there was no disturbance to his love for ka this important question asked of ka by arjuna will clarify the distinction between the impersonal and personal conceptions of the absolute truth text 2 r bhagavn uvca mayy veya mano ye m nityayukt upsate

with faith and devotion is to be considered most perfect in yoga for one in such ka consciousness there are no material activities because everything is done by ka a pure devotee is constantly engagedsometimes he chants sometimes he hears or reads books about ka or sometimes he cooks prasdam or goes to the marketplace to purchase something for ka or sometimes he washes the temple or the disheswhatever he does he does not let a single moment pass without devoting his activities to ka such action is in full samdhi texts 34 ye tv akaram anirdeyam avyakta paryupsate sarvatragam acintya

being equally disposed to everyone such persons engaged in the welfare of all at last achieve me purport those who do not directly worship the supreme godhead ka but who attempt to achieve the same goal by an indirect process also ultimately achieve the supreme goal r ka as is stated after many births the man of wisdom seeks refuge in me knowing vsudeva is all when a person comes to full knowledge after many births he surrenders unto lord ka if one approaches the godhead by the method mentioned in this verse he has to control the senses render service to everyone and engage in the welfare of all beings it is inferred that one has to approach lord ka otherwise there is no perfect realization often there is much penance involved before one fully surrenders unto him in order to perceive the supersoul within the individual soul one has to cease the sensual activities of seeing hearing tasting working etc then one comes to understand that the supreme soul is present everywhere realizing this one envies no living entityhe sees no difference between man and animal because he sees soul only not the outer covering but for the common man this method of impersonal realization is very difficult text 5 kleo dhikataras tem avyaktsaktacetasm avyakt hi gatir dukha dehavadbhir avpyate kleatrouble adhikataramore troublesome temof them avyaktaunmanifested saktabeing attached cetasmof those whose minds avyaktunmanifested hicertainly gati dukhamprogress is troublesome dehavadbhiof the embodiments avpyateachieve translation for those whose minds are attached to the unmanifested impersonal feature of the supreme advancement is very troublesome to make progress in that discipline is always difficult for those who are embodied purport the group of transcendentalists who follow the path of the inconceivable unmanifested impersonal feature of the supreme lord are called jnayogs and persons who are in full ka consciousness engaged in devotional service to the lord are called bhaktiyogs now here the difference between jnayoga and bhaktiyoga is definitely expressed the process of jnayoga although ultimately bringing one to the same goal is very troublesome whereas the path of bhaktiyoga the process of being in direct service to the supreme personality of godhead is easier and is natural for the embodied soul the individual soul is embodied since time immemorial it is very difficult for him to simply theoretically understand that he is not the body therefore the bhaktiyog accepts the deity of ka as worshipable because there is some bodily conception fixed in the mind which can thus be applied of course worship of the supreme personality of godhead in his form within the temple is not idol worship there is evidence in the vedic literature that worship may be sagua and nirguaof the supreme possessing or not possessing attributes worship of the deity in the temple is sagua worship for the lord is represented by material qualities but the form of the lord though represented by material qualities such as stone wood or oil paint is not actually material that is the absolute nature of the supreme lord a crude example may be given here we may find some mailboxes on the street and if we post our letters in those boxes they will naturally go to their destination without difficulty but any old box or an imitation which we may find somewhere which is not authorized by the post office will not do the work similarly god has an authorized representation in the deity form which is called arcavigraha this arcavigraha is an incarnation of the supreme lord god will accept service through that form the lord is omnipotent and allpowerful therefore by his incarnation as arcavigraha he can accept the services of the devotee just to make it convenient for the man in conditioned life so for a devotee there is no difficulty in approaching the supreme immediately and directly but for those who are following the impersonal way to spiritual realization the path is difficult they have to understand the unmanifested representation of the supreme through such vedic literatures as the upaniads and they have to learn the language understand the nonperceptual feelings and they have to realize all these processes this is not very easy for a common man a person in ka consciousness engaged in devotional service simply by the guidance of the bona fide spiritual master simply by offering regulative obeisances unto the deity simply by hearing the glories of the lord and simply by eating the remnants of foodstuffs offered to the lord realizes the supreme personality of godhead very easily there is no doubt that the impersonalists are unnecessarily taking a troublesome path with the risk of not realizing the absolute truth at the ultimate end but the personalist without any risk trouble or difficulty approaches the supreme personality directly a similar passage appears in rmadbhgavatam it is stated there that if one has to ultimately surrender unto the supreme personality of godhead this surrendering process is called bhakti but instead takes the trouble to understand what is brahman and what is not brahman and spends his whole life in that way the result is simply troublesome therefore it is advised here that one should not take up this troublesome path of selfrealization because there is uncertainty in the ultimate result a living entity is eternally an individual soul and if he wants to merge into the spiritual whole he may accomplish the realization of the eternal and knowledgeable aspects of his original nature but the blissful portion is not realized by the grace of some devotee such a transcendentalist highly learned in the process of jnayoga may come to the point of bhaktiyoga or devotional service at that time long practice in impersonalism also becomes a source of trouble because he cannot give up the idea therefore an embodied soul is always in difficulty with the unmanifest both at the time of practice and at the time of realization every living soul is partially independent and one should know for certain that this unmanifested realization is against the nature of his spiritual blissful self one should not take up this process for every individual living entity the process of ka consciousness which entails full engagement in devotional service is the best way if one wants to ignore this devotional service there is the danger of turning to atheism thus this process of centering attention on the unmanifested the inconceivable which is beyond the approach of the senses as already expressed in this verse should never be encouraged at any time especially in this age it is not advised by lord ka texts 67 ye tu sarvi karmi mayi sannyasya matpar ananyenaiva yogena m dhyyanta upsate

being devoted to me without deviation engaged in devotional service and always meditating upon me who has fixed his mind upon me o son of pth for him i am the swift deliverer from the ocean of birth and death purport it is explicitly stated here that the devotees are very fortunate to be delivered very soon from material existence by the lord in pure devotional service one comes to the realization that god is great and that the individual soul is subordinate to him his duty is to render service to the lordif not then he will render service to my as stated before the supreme lord can only be appreciated by devotional service therefore one should be fully devoted one should fix his mind fully on ka in order to achieve him one should work only for ka it does not matter in what kind of work one engages but that work should be done only for ka that is the standard of devotional service the devotee does not desire any achievement other than pleasing the supreme personality of godhead his lifes mission is to please ka and he can sacrifice everything for kas satisfaction just as arjuna did in the battle of kuruketra the process is very simple one can devote himself in his occupation and engage at the same time in chanting hare ka hare ka ka ka hare hare hare rma hare rma rma rma hare hare such transcendental chanting attracts the devotee to the personality of godhead the supreme lord herein promises that he will without delay deliver a pure devotee thus engaged from the ocean of material existence those who are advanced in yoga practice can willfully transfer the soul to whatever planet they like by the yoga process and others take the opportunity in various ways but as far as the devotee is concerned it is clearly stated here that the lord himself takes him he does not need to wait to become very experienced in order to transfer himself to the spiritual sky in the varha pura this verse appears naymi parama sthnam arcirdigati vin garuaskandham ropya yatheccham anivrita the purport of this verse is that a devotee does not need to practice agayoga in order to transfer his soul to the spiritual planets the responsibility is taken by the supreme lord himself he clearly states here that he himself becomes the deliverer a child is completely cared for by his parents and thus his position is secure similarly a devotee does not need to endeavor to transfer himself by yoga practice to other planets rather the supreme lord by his great mercy comes at once riding on his bird carrier garua and at once delivers the devotee from this material existence although a man who has fallen in the ocean may struggle very hard and may be very expert in swimming he cannot save himself but if someone comes and picks him up from the water then he is easily rescued similarly the lord picks up the devotee from this material existence one simply has to practice the easy process of ka consciousness and fully engage himself in devotional service any intelligent man should always prefer the process of devotional service to all other paths in the nryaya this is confirmed as follows y vai sdhanasampattipururthacatuaye tay vin tadpnoti naro nryaraya the purport of this verse is that one should not engage in the different processes of fruitive activity or cultivate knowledge by the mental speculative process one who is devoted to the supreme personality can attain all the benefits derived from other yogic processes speculation rituals sacrifices charities etc that is the specific benediction of devotional service simply by chanting the holy name of kahare ka hare ka ka ka hare hare hare rma hare rma rma rma hare hare a devotee of the lord can approach the supreme destination easily and happily but this destination cannot be approached by any other process of religion the conclusion of bhagavadgt is stated in the eighteenth chapter sarvadharmn parityajya mm eka araa vraja aha tv sarvappebhyo mokayiymi m uca one should give up all other processes of selfrealization and simply execute devotional service in ka consciousness that will enable one to reach the highest perfection of life there is no need for one to consider the sinful actions of his past life because the supreme lord fully takes charge of him therefore one should not futilely try to deliver himself in spiritual realization let everyone take shelter of the supreme omnipotent godhead ka that is the highest perfection of life text 8 mayy eva mana dhatsva mayi buddhi niveaya nivasiyasi mayy eva ata rdhva na saaya mayiunto me evacertainly

supreme personality of godhead and engage all your intelligence in me thus you will live in me always without a doubt purport one who is engaged in lord kas devotional service lives in a direct relationship with the supreme lord so there is no doubt that his position is transcendental from the very beginning a devotee does not live on the material planehe lives in ka the holy name of the lord and the lord are nondifferent therefore when a devotee chants hare ka ka and his internal potency are dancing on the tongue of the devotee when he offers ka food ka directly accepts these eatables and the devotee becomes kaized by eating the remnants one who does not engage in such service cannot understand how this is so although this is a process recommended in the gt and in other vedic literatures text 9 atha citta samdhtu na aknoi mayi sthiram abhysayogena tato mm icchptu dhanajaya athaif therefore cittammind samdhtamfixing nanot aknoi able mayiupon me sthiramfixed abhysapractice yogena by devotional service tatatherefore mmme icchdesire ptum to get dhanajayao arjuna translation my dear arjuna o winner of wealth if you cannot fix your mind upon me without deviation then follow the regulated principles of bhaktiyoga in this way you will develop a desire to attain to me purport in this verse two different processes of bhaktiyoga are indicated the first applies to one who has actually developed an attachment for ka the supreme personality of godhead by transcendental love and the other is for one who has not developed an attachment for the supreme person by transcendental love for this second class there are different prescribed rules and regulations which one can follow to be ultimately elevated to the stage of attachment to ka bhaktiyoga isthe purification of the senses at the present moment in material existence the senses are always impure being engaged in sense gratification but by the practice of bhaktiyoga these senses can become purified and in the purified state they come directly in contact with the supreme lord in this material existence i may be engaged in some service to some master but i dont really lovingly serve my master i simply serve to get some money and the master also is not in love he takes service from me and pays me so there is no question of love but for spiritual life one must be elevated to the pure stage of love that stage of love can be achieved by practice of devotional service performed with the present senses this love of god is now in a dormant state in everyones heart and there love of god is manifested in different ways but it is contaminated by the material association now the material association has to be purified and that dormant natural love for ka has to be revived that is the whole process to practice the regulative principles of bhaktiyoga one should under the guidance of an expert spiritual master follow certain principles one should rise early in the morning take bath enter the temple and offer prayers and chant hare ka then collect flowers to offer to the deity cook foodstuffs to offer to the deity take prasdam and so on there are various rules and regulations which one should follow and one should constantly hear bhagavadgt and rmad bhgavatam from pure devotees this practice can help anyone to rise to the level of love of god and then he is sure of his progress into the spiritual kingdom of god this practice of bhaktiyoga under the rules and regulations with the direction of a spiritual master will surely bring one to the stage of love of god text

matarthamfor my sake apieven though karmiwhat kurvan performing siddhimperfection avpsyasiachieve translation if you cannot practice the regulations of bhaktiyoga then just try to work for me because by working for me you will come to the perfect stage purport one who is not able even to practice the regulative principles of bhaktiyoga under the guidance of a spiritual master can still be drawn to this perfectional stage by working for the supreme lord how to do this work has already been explained in the fiftyfifth verse of the eleventh chapter one should be sympathetic to the propagation of ka consciousness there are many devotees who are engaged in the propagation of ka consciousness and they require help so even if one cannot directly practice the regulated principles of bhaktiyoga he can try to help such work every endeavor requires land capital organization and labor just as in business one requires a place to stay some capital to use some labor and some organization to expand so the same is required in the service of ka the only difference is that in materialism one works for sense gratification the same work however can be performed for the satisfaction of ka and that is spiritual activity if one has sufficient money he can help in building an office or temple for propagating ka consciousness or he can help with publications there are various fields of activity and one should be interested in such activities if one cannot sacrifice the result of such activities the same person can still sacrifice some percentage to propagate ka consciousness this voluntary service to the cause of ka consciousness will help one to rise to a higher state of love for god whereupon one becomes perfect text 11 athaitad apy aakto si kartu madyogam rita sarvakarmaphalatyga

tatatherefore kurudo yatatmavanselfsituated translation if however you are unable to work in this consciousness then try to act giving up all results of your work and try to be selfsituated purport it may be that one is unable to even sympathize with the activities of ka consciousness because of social familial or religious considerations or because of some other impediments if one attaches himself directly to the activities of ka consciousness there may be objection from family members or so many other difficulties for one who has such a problem it is advised that he sacrifice the accumulated result of his activities to some good cause such procedures are described in the vedic rules there are many descriptions of sacrifices and special functions of the pumundi or special work in which the result of ones previous action may be applied thus one may gradually become elevated to the state of knowledge it is also found that when one who is not even interested in the activities of ka consciousness gives charity to some hospital or some other social institution he gives up the hardearned results of his activities that is also recommended here because by the practice of giving up the fruits of ones activities one is sure to purify his mind gradually and in that purified stage of mind one becomes able to understand ka consciousness of course ka consciousness is not dependent on any other experience because ka consciousness itself can purify ones mind but if there are impediments to ka consciousness one may try to give up the result of his action in that respect social service community service national service sacrifice for ones country etc may be accepted so that some day one may come to the stage of pure devotional service to the supreme lord in bhagavadgt we find it is stated yata pravttir bhtnm if one decides to sacrifice for the supreme cause even if he does not know that the supreme cause is ka he will come gradually to understand that ka is the supreme cause by the sacrificial method text 12 reyo hi jnam abhysj jnd dhyna viiyate dhynt karmaphalatygas tygc chntir anantaram reyabetter hicertainly jnamknowledge abhystby practice jnntbetter than

translation if you cannot take to this practice then engage yourself in the cultivation of knowledge better than knowledge however is meditation and better than meditation is renunciation of the fruits of action for by such renunciation one can attain peace of mind purport as mentioned in the previous verses there are two kinds of devotional service the way of regulated principles and the way of full attachment in love to the supreme personality of godhead for those who are actually not able to follow the principles of ka consciousness it is better to cultivate knowledge because by knowledge one can be able to understand his real position gradually knowledge will develop to the point of meditation by meditation one can be able to understand the supreme personality of godhead by a gradual process there are processes which make one understand that one himself is the supreme and that sort of meditation is preferred if one is unable to engage in devotional service if one is not able to meditate in such a way then there are prescribed duties as enjoined in the vedic literature for the brhmaas vaiyas and dras which we shall find in a later chapter of bhagavadgt but in all cases one should give up the result or fruits of labor this means to employ the result of karma for some good cause in summary to reach the supreme personality of godhead the highest goal there are two processes one process is by gradual development and the other process is direct devotional service in ka consciousness is the direct method and the other method involves renouncing the fruits of ones activities then one can come to the stage of knowledge then to the stage of meditation then to the stage of understanding the supersoul and then to the stage of the supreme personality of godhead one may either take the step by step process or the direct path the direct process is not possible for everyone therefore the indirect process is also good it is however to be understood that the indirect process is not recommended for arjuna because he is already at the stage of loving devotional service to the supreme lord it is for others who are not at this state for them the gradual process of renunciation knowledge meditation and realization of the supersoul and brahman should be followed but as far as bhagavadgt is concerned it is the direct method that is stressed everyone is advised to take to the direct method and surrender unto the supreme personality of godhead ka texts 1314 adve sarvabhtn maitra karua eva ca nirmamo nirahakra samadukhasukha kam santua satata yog yattm

think himself a proprietor who is free from false ego and equal both in happiness and distress who is always satisfied and engaged in devotional service with determination and whose mind and intelligence are in agreement with mehe is very dear to me purport coming again to the point of pure devotional service the lord is describing the transcendental qualifications of a pure devotee in these two verses a pure devotee is never disturbed in any circumstances nor is he envious of anyone nor does a devotee become his enemys enemy he thinks that one is acting as his enemy due to his own past misdeeds thus it is better to suffer than to protest in the rmadbhgavatam it is stated tat te nukamp susamkyamao whenever a devotee is in distress or has fallen into difficulty he thinks that it is the lords mercy upon him he thinks thanks to my past misdeeds i should suffer far far greater than i am suffering now so it is by the mercy of the supreme lord that i am not getting all the punishment i am due i am just getting a little by the mercy of the supreme personality of godhead therefore he is always calm quiet and patient despite many distressful conditions a devotee is also always kind to everyone even to his enemy nirmama means that a devotee does not attach much importance to the peace and trouble pertaining to the body because he knows perfectly well that he is not the material body he does not identify with the body therefore he is freed from the conception of false ego and is equiposed both in happiness and distress he is tolerant and he is satisfied with whatever comes by the grace of the supreme lord he does not endeavor much to achieve something with great difficulty therefore he is always joyful he is a completely perfect mystic because he is fixed in the instructions received from the spiritual master and because his senses are controlled he is determined he is not swayed by false argument because no one can lead him from the fixed determination of devotional service he is fully conscious that ka is the eternal lord so no one can disturb him all his qualifications enable him to depend entirely on the supreme lord such a standard of devotional service is undoubtably very rare but a devotee becomes situated in that stage by following the regulative principles of devotional service furthermore the lord says that such a devotee is very dear to him for the lord is always pleased with all his activities in full ka consciousness text 15 yasmn nodvijate loko lokn nodvijate ca ya harmarabhayodvegair mukto ya sa ca me priya

devotees qualifications are further being described no one is put into difficulty anxiety fearfulness or dissatisfaction by such a devotee since a devotee is kind to everyone he does not act in such a way to put others into anxiety at the same time if others try to put a devotee into anxiety he is not disturbed it is by the grace of the lord that he is so practiced that he is not disturbed by any outward disturbance actually because a devotee is always engrossed in ka consciousness and engaged in devotional service all such material circumstances cannot woo him generally a materialistic person becomes very happy when there is something for his sense gratification and his body but when he sees that others have something for their sense gratification and he hasnt he is sorry and envious when he is expecting some retaliation from an enemy he is in a state of fear and when he cannot successfully execute something he becomes dejected but a devotee is always transcendental to all these disturbances therefore he is very dear to ka text 16 anapeka ucir daka udsno gatavyatha sarvrambhaparityg yo madbhakta sa me priya anapekaneutral ucipure dakaexpert udsnafree from care gatavyathafreed

pure expert without cares free from all pains and who does not strive for some result is very dear to me purport money may be offered to a devotee but he should not struggle to acquire it if automatically by the grace of the supreme money comes to him he is not agitated naturally a devotee takes bath at least twice in a day and rises early in the morning for devotional service thus he is naturally clean both inwardly and outwardly a devotee is always expert because he fully knows the sense of all activities of life and he is convinced of the authoritative scriptures a devotee never takes the part of a particular party therefore he is carefree he is never pained because he is free from all designations he knows that his body is a designation so if there are some bodily pains he is free the pure devotee does not endeavor for anything which is against the principles of devotional service for example constructing a big building requires great energy and a devotee does not take to such business if it does not benefit him by advancing his devotional service he may construct a temple for the lord and for that he may take all kinds of anxiety but he does not construct a big house for his personal relations text 17 yo na hyati na dvei na ocati na kkati ubhubhaparityg bhaktimn ya sa me priya yaone who nanever hyatitakes pleasure nanever dvei grieves nanever ocatilaments

get a son or disciple nor is he distressed by not getting them if he loses anything which is very dear to him he does not lament similarly if he does not get what he desires he is not distressed he is transcendental in the face of all kinds of auspicious inauspicious and sinful activities he is prepared to accept all kinds of risks for the satisfaction of the supreme lord nothing is an impediment in the discharge of his devotional service such a devotee is very dear to ka texts 1819 sama atrau ca mitre ca tath mnpamnayo toasukhadukheu sama sagavivarjita tulyanindstutir maun santuo yena kenacit

is always free from contamination always silent and satisfied with anything who doesnt care for any residence who is fixed in knowledge and engaged in devotional service is very dear to me purport a devotee is always free from all bad association sometimes one is praised and sometimes one is defamed that is the nature of human society but a devotee is always transcendental to artificial fame and infamy distress or happiness he is very patient he does not speak of anything but the topics about ka therefore he is called silent silent does not mean that one should not speak silent means that one should not speak nonsense one should speak only of essentials and the most essential speech for the devotee is to speak of the supreme lord he is happy in all conditions sometimes he may get very palatable foodstuffs sometimes not but he is satisfied nor does he care for any residential facility he may sometimes live underneath a tree and he may sometimes live in a very palatial building he is attracted to neither he is called fixed because he is fixed in his determination and knowledge we may find some repetition in the descriptions of the qualifications of a devotee but this is just to give an illustration of the fact that a devotee must acquire all these qualifications without good qualifications one cannot be a pure devotee one who is not a devotee has no good qualification one who wants to be recognized as a devotee should develop the good qualifications of course he does not extraneously endeavor to acquire these qualifications but engagement in ka consciousness and devotional service automatically helps him develop them text 20 ye tu dharmmtam ida yathokta paryupsate raddadhn matparam bhakts te tva me priy yeone who tubut dharmyagenerosity amtamunderstanding

follows this imperishable path of devotional service and who completely engages himself with faith making me the supreme goal is very very dear to me purport in this chapter the religion of eternal engagement the explanation of the process of transcendental service for approaching the supreme lord is given this process is very dear to the lord and he accepts a person who is engaged in such a process the question who is betterone who is engaged in the path of impersonal brahman or one who is engaged in the personal service of the supreme personality of godheadwas raised by arjuna and the lord replied to him so explicitly that there is no doubt that devotional service to the personality of godhead is the best of all processes of spiritual realization in other words in this chapter it is decided that through good association one develops attachment for pure devotional service and thereby accepts a bona fide spiritual master and from him begins to hear and chant and observe the regulative principles of devotional service with faith attachment and devotion and thus becomes engaged in the transcendental service of the lord this path is recommended in this chapter therefore there is no doubt that devotional service is the only absolute path for selfrealization for the attainment of the supreme personality of godhead the impersonal conception of the supreme absolute truth as described in this chapter is recommended only up to the time one surrenders himself for selfrealization in other words as long as one does not have the chance to associate with a pure devotee the impersonal conception may be beneficial in the impersonal conception of the absolute truth one works without fruitive result meditates and cultivates knowledge to understand spirit and matter this is necessary as long as one is not in the association of a pure devotee fortunately if one develops directly a desire to engage in ka consciousness in pure devotional service he does not need to undergo step by step improvements in spiritual realization devotional service as described in the middle six chapters of bhagavadgt is more congenial one need not bother about materials to keep body and soul together because by the grace of the lord everything is carried out automatically thus end the bhaktivedanta purports to the twelfth chapter of the rmadbhagavadgt in the matter of devotional service chapter thirteen nature the enjoyer and consciousness texts 12 arjuna uvca prakti purua caiva ketra ketrajam eva ca etad veditum icchmi jna jeya ca keava r bhagavn uvca ida arra kaunteya ketram ity

nature purua the enjoyer and the field and the knower of the field and of knowledge and the end of knowledge the blessed lord then said this body o son of kunt is called the field and one who knows this body is called the knower of the field purport arjuna was inquisitive about prakti or nature purua the enjoyer ketra the field ketraja its knower and of knowledge and the object of knowledge when he inquired about all these ka said that this body is called the field and that one who knows this body is called the knower of the field this body is the field of activity for the conditioned soul the conditioned soul is entrapped in material existence and he attempts to lord over material nature and so according to his capacity to dominate material nature he gets a field of activity that field of activity is the body and what is the body the body is made of senses the conditioned soul wants to enjoy sense gratification and according to his capacity to enjoy sense gratification he is offered a body or field of activity therefore the body is called ketra or the field of activity for the conditioned soul now the person who does not identify himself with the body is called ketraja the knower of the field it is not very difficult to understand the difference between the field and its knower the body and the knower of the body any person can consider that from childhood to old age he undergoes so many changes of body and yet is still one person remaining thus there is a difference between the knower of the field of activities and the actual field of activities a living conditioned soul can thus understand that he is different from the body it is described in the beginningdehe sminthat the living entity is within the body and that the body is changing from childhood to boyhood and from boyhood to youth and from youth to old age and the person who owns the body knows that the body is changing the owner is distinctly ketraja sometimes we understand that i am happy i am mad i am a woman i am a dog i am a cat these are the knowers the knower is different from the field although we use many articlesour clothes etcwe know that we are different from the things used similarly we also understand by a little contemplation that we are different from the body in the first six chapters of bhagavadgt the knower of the body the living entity and the position by which he can understand the supreme lord are described in the middle six chapters of the gt the supreme personality of godhead and the relationship between the individual soul and the supersoul in regard to devotional service are described the superior position of the supreme personality of godhead and the subordinate position of the individual soul are definitely defined in these chapters the living entities are subordinate under all circumstances but in their forgetfulness they are suffering when enlightened by pious activities they approach the supreme lord in different capacitiesas the distressed those in want of money the inquisitive and those in search of knowledge that is also described now starting with the thirteenth chapter how the living entity comes into contact with material nature how he is delivered by the supreme lord through the different methods of fruitive activities cultivation of knowledge and the discharge of devotional service are explained although the living entity is completely different from the material body he somehow becomes related this also is explained text 3 ketraja cpi m viddhi sarvaketreu bhrata ketraketrajayor jna yat taj jna mata mama

which is taught tatthat jnam knowledge matamopinion mamathat translation o scion of bharata you should understand that i am also the knower in all bodies and to understand this body and its owner is called knowledge that is my opinion purport while discussing the subject of this body and the owner of the body the soul and the supersoul we shall find three different topics of study the lord the living entity and matter in every field of activities in every body there are two souls the individual soul and the supersoul because the supersoul is the plenary expansion of the supreme personality of godhead ka ka says i am also the knower but i am not the individual owner of the body i am the superknower i am present in every body as the paramtm or supersoul one who studies the subject matter of the field of activity and the knower of the field very minutely in terms of this bhagavadgt can attain to knowledge the lord says i am the knower of the field of activities in every individual body the individual may be the knower of his own body but he is not in knowledge of other bodies the supreme personality of godhead who is present as the supersoul in all bodies knows everything about all bodies he knows all the different bodies of all the various species of life a citizen may know everything about his patch of land but the king knows not only his palace but all the properties possessed by the individual citizens similarly one may be the proprietor of the body individually but the supreme lord is the proprietor of all bodies the king is the original proprietor of the kingdom and the citizen is the secondary proprietor similarly the supreme lord is the supreme proprietor of all bodies the body consists of the senses the supreme lord is hkea which means controller of the senses he is the original controller of the senses just as the king is the original controller of all the activities of the state and the citizens are secondary controllers the lord also says i am also the knower this means that he is the superknower the individual soul knows only his particular body in the vedic literature it is stated as follows ketri hi arri bja cpi ubhubhe tni vetti sa yogtm tata ketraja ucyate this body is called the ketra and within it dwells the owner of the body and the supreme lord who knows both the body and the owner of the body therefore he is called the knower of all fields the distinction between the field of activities the owner of activities and the supreme owner of activities is described as follows perfect knowledge of the constitution of the body the constitution of the individual soul and the constitution of the supersoul is known in terms of vedic literature as jnam that is the opinion of ka to understand both the soul and the supersoul as one yet distinct is knowledge one who does not understand the field of activity and the knower of activity is not in perfect knowledge one has to understand the position of prakti nature and purua the enjoyer of the nature and vara the knower who dominates or controls nature and the individual soul one should not confuse the three in their different capacities one should not confuse the painter the painting and the easel this material world which is the field of activities is nature and the enjoyer of nature is the living entity and above them both is the supreme controller the personality of godhead it is stated in the vedic language bhokt bhogya preritra ca matv sarva prokta tri vidha brahmam etat there are three brahman conceptions prakti is brahman as the field of activities and the jva individual soul is also brahman and is trying to control material nature and the controller of both of them is also brahman but he is the factual controller in this chapter it will be also explained that out of the two knowers one is fallible and the other is infallible one is superior and the other is subordinate one who understands the two knowers of the field to be one and the same contradicts the supreme personality of godhead who states here very clearly that i am also the knower of the field of activity one who misunderstands a rope to be a serpent is not in knowledge there are different kinds of bodies and there are different owners of the bodies because each individual soul has his individual capacity of lording it over material nature there are different bodies but the supreme also is present in them as the controller the word ca is significant for it indicates the total number of bodies that is the opinion of rla baladeva vidybhaa ka is the supersoul present in

activities in their constitutional positions one has to know how this body is constituted the materials of which this body is made under whose control this body is working how the changes are taking place wherefrom the changes are coming what the causes are what the reasons are what the ultimate goal of the individual is and what the actual form of the individual soul is one should also know the distinction between the individual living soul and the supersoul the different influences their potentials etc one just has to understand this bhagavadgt directly from the description given by the supreme personality of godhead and all this will be clarified but one should be careful not to consider the supreme personality of godhead in every body and individual soul to be the jva this is something like equalizing the potent and the impotent text 5 ibhir bahudh gta chandobhir vividhaih pthak brahmastrapadai caiva hetumadbhir vinicitai ibhiby the wise sages bahudhin many ways

knowledge of the field of activities and of the knower of activities is described by various sages in various vedic writings especially in the vedntastraand is presented with all reasoning as to cause and effect purport the supreme personality of godhead ka is the highest authority in explaining this knowledge still as a matter of course learned scholars and standard authorities always give evidence from previous authorities ka is explaining this most controversial point regarding the duality and nonduality of the soul and the supersoul by referring to scriptures the vednta which are accepted as authority first he says this is according to different sages as far as the sages are concerned besides himself vysadeva the author of the vedntastra is a great sage and in the vedntastra duality is perfectly explained and vysadevas father parara was also a great sage and he writes in his books of religiosity aham tva ca athnye weyou i and various other living entitiesare all transcendental although in material bodies now we are fallen into the ways of the three modes of material nature according to our different karma as such some are on higher levels and some are in the lower nature the higher and lower natures exist due to ignorance and are being manifested in an infinite number of living entities but the supersoul which is infallible is uncontaminated by the three qualities of nature and is transcendental similarly in the original vedas a distinction between the soul the supersoul and the body is made especially in the kaha upaniad there is a manifestation of the supreme lords energy known as annamaya by which one depends simply upon food for existence this is a materialistic realization of the supreme then there is pramaya this means that after realizing the supreme absolute truth in foodstuff one can realize the absolute truth in the living symptoms or life forms in jnamaya the living symptom develops to the point of thinking feeling and willing then there is brahman realization and the realization called vijnamaya by which the living entitys mind and life symptoms are distinguished from the living entity himself the next and supreme stage is nandamaya realization of the allblissful nature thus there are five stages of brahman realization which is called brahma puccham out of these the first threeannamaya pramaya and jnamayainvolve the fields of activities of the living entities transcendental to all these fields of activities is the supreme lord who is called nandamaya in the vednta stra also the supreme is called nandamayo bhyst the supreme personality of godhead is by nature full of joy and to enjoy his transcendental bliss he expands into vijnamaya pramaya jnamaya and annamaya in this field of activities the living entity is considered to be the enjoyer and different from him is the nandamaya that means that if the living entity decides to enjoy in dovetailing himself with the nandamaya then he becomes perfect this is the real picture of the supreme lord as supreme knower of the field the living entity as subordinate knower and the nature of the field of activities texts 67 mahbhtny ahakro buddhir avyaktam eva ca

interactions purport from all the authoritative statements of the great sages the vedic hymns and the aphorisms of the vedntastra the components of this world are earth water fire air and ether these are the five great elements mahbhta then there are false ego intelligence and the unmanifested stage of the three modes of nature then there are five senses for acquiring knowledge the eyes ears nose tongue and touch then five working senses voice legs hands the anus and the genitals then above the senses there is the mind which is within and which can be called the sense within therefore including the mind there are eleven senses altogether then there are the five objects of the senses smell taste warmth touch and sound now the aggregate of these twentyfour elements is called the field of activity if one makes an analytical study of these twentyfour subjects then he can very well understand the field of activity then there is desire hatred pleasure and pain which are interactions representations of the five great elements in the gross body the living symptoms represented by consciousness and conviction are the manifestation of the subtle body mind ego and intelligence these subtle elements are included within the field of activities the five great elements are a gross representation of the subtle false ego they are a representation in the material conception consciousness is represented by intelligence of which the unmanifested stage is the three modes of material nature the unmanifested three modes of material nature is called pradhna one who desires to know the twentyfour elements in detail along with their interactions should study the philosophy in more detail in bhagavadgt a summary only is given the body is the representation of all these factors and there are changes of the body which are six in number the body is born it grows it stays it produces byproducts then begins to decay and at the last stage it vanishes therefore the field is a nonpermanent material thing however the ketraja the knower of the field its proprietor is different texts 812 amnitvam adambhitvam ahis kntir rjavam cryopsana auca sthairyam tmavinigraha

age and disease nonattachment to children wife home and the rest and evenmindedness amid pleasant and unpleasant events constant and unalloyed devotion to me resorting to solitary places detachment from the general mass of people accepting the importance of selfrealization and philosophical search for the absolute truthall these i thus declare to be knowledge and what is contrary to these is ignorance purport this process of knowledge is sometimes misunderstood by less intelligent men as being the interaction of the field of activity but actually this is the real process of knowledge if one accepts this process then the possibility of approaching the absolute truth exists this is not the interaction of the tenfold elements as described before this is actually the means to get out of it of all the descriptions of the process of knowledge the most important point is described in the first line of the tenth verse the process of knowledge terminates in unalloyed devotional service to the lord so if one does not approach or is not able to approach the transcendental service of the lord then the other nineteen items are of no particular value but if one takes to devotional service in full ka consciousness the other nineteen items automatically develop within him the principle of accepting a spiritual master as mentioned in the seventh verse is essential even for one who takes to devotional service it is most important transcendental life begins when one accepts a bona fide spiritual master the supreme personality of godhead r ka clearly states here that this process of knowledge is the actual path anything speculated beyond this is nonsense as for the knowledge outlined here the items may be analyzed as follows humility means that one should not be anxious to have the satisfaction of being honored by others the material conception of life makes us very eager to receive honor from others but from the point of view of a man in perfect knowledgewho knows that he is not this body anything honor or dishonor pertaining to this body is useless one should not be hankering after this material deception people are very anxious to be famous for their religion and consequently sometimes it is found that without understanding the principles of religion one enters into some group which is not actually following religious principles and then wants to advertise himself as a religious mentor as for actual advancement in spiritual science one should have a test to see how far he is progressing he can judge by these items nonviolence is generally taken to mean not killing or destroying the body but actually nonviolence means not to put others into distress people in general are trapped by ignorance in the material concept of life and they perpetually suffer material pains so unless one elevates people to spiritual knowledge one is practicing violence one should try his best to distribute real knowledge to the people so that they may become enlightened and leave this material entanglement that is nonviolence tolerance means that one should be practiced to bear insult and dishonor from others if one is engaged in the advancement of spiritual knowledge there will be so many insults and much dishonor from others this is expected because material nature is so constituted even a boy like prahlda who only five years old was engaged in the cultivation of spiritual knowledge was endangered when his father became antagonistic to his devotion the father tried to kill him in so many ways but prahlda tolerated him so for making advancement in spiritual knowledge there may be many impediments but we should be tolerant and continue our progress with determination simplicity means that without diplomacy one should be so straightforward that he can disclose the real truth even to an enemy as for acceptance of the spiritual master that is essential because without the instruction of a bona fide spiritual master one cannot progress in the spiritual science one should approach the spiritual master with all humility and offer him all services so that he will be pleased to bestow his blessings upon the disciple because a bona fide spiritual master is a representative of ka if he bestows any blessings upon his disciple that will make the disciple immediately advanced without the disciples following the regulated principles or the regulated principles will be easier for one who has served the spiritual master without reservation cleanliness is essential for making advancement in spiritual life there are two kinds of cleanliness external and internal external cleanliness means taking a bath but for internal cleanliness one has to think of ka always and chant hare ka hare ka ka ka hare harehare rma hare rma rma rma hare hare this process cleans the accumulated dust of past karma from the mind steadiness means that one should be very determined to make progress in spiritual life without such determination one cannot make tangible progress and selfcontrol means that one should not accept anything which is detrimental to the path of spiritual progress one should become accustomed to this and reject anything which is against the path of spiritual progress this is real renunciation the senses are so strong that they are always anxious to have sense gratification one should not cater to these demands which are not necessary the senses should only be gratified to keep the body fit so that one can discharge his duty in advancing in spiritual life the most important and uncontrollable sense is the tongue if one can control the tongue then there is every possibility of controlling the other senses the function of the tongue is to taste and to vibrate therefore by systematic regulation the tongue should always be engaged in tasting the remnants of foodstuffs offered to ka and chanting hare ka as far as the eyes are concerned they should not be allowed to see anything but the beautiful form of ka that will control the eyes similarly the ears should be engaged in hearing about ka and the nose in smelling the flowers offered to ka this is the process of devotional service and it is understood here that bhagavadgt is simply expounding the science of devotional service devotional service is the main and sole objective unintelligent commentators on the gt try to divert the mind of the reader to other subjects but there is no other subject in bhagavad gt but devotional service false ego means accepting this body as oneself when one understands that he is not his body and is spirit soul that is real ego ego is there false ego is condemned but not real ego in the vedic literature it is said aha brahmsmi i am brahman i am spirit this i am the sense of self also exists in the liberated stage of selfrealization this sense of i am is ego but when the sense of i am is applied to this false body it is false ego when the sense of self is applied to reality that is real ego there are some philosophers who say we should give up our ego but we cannot give up our ego because ego means identity we ought of course to give up the false identification with the body one should try to understand the distress of accepting birth death old age and disease there are descriptions in various vedic literatures of birth in the rmadbhgavatam the world of the unborn the childs stay in the womb of the mother its suffering etc are all very graphically described it should be thoroughly understood that birth is distressful because we forget how much distress we have suffered within the womb of the mother we do not make any solution to the repetition of birth and death similarly at the time of death there are all kinds of sufferings and they are also mentioned in the authoritative scriptures these should be discussed and as far as disease and old age are concerned everyone gets practical experience no one wants to be diseased and no one wants to become old but there is no avoiding these unless we have a pessimistic view of this material life considering the distresses of birth death old age and disease there is no impetus for our making advancement in spiritual life as for detachment from children wife and home it is not meant that one should have no feeling for these they are natural objects of affection but when they are not favorable to spiritual progress then one should not be attached to them the best process for making the home pleasant is ka consciousness if one is in full ka consciousness he can make his home very happy because this process of ka consciousness is very easy one need only chant hare ka hare ka ka ka hare harehare rma hare rma rma rma hare hare accept the remnants of foodstuffs offered to ka have some discussion on books like bhagavadgt and rmadbhgavatam and engage oneself in deity worship these four will make one happy one should train the members of his family in this way the family members can sit down morning and evening and chant together hare ka hare ka ka ka hare harehare rma hare rma rma rma hare hare if one can mold his family life in this way to develop ka consciousness following these four principles then there is no need to change from family life to renounced life but if it is not congenial not favorable for spiritual advancement then family life should be abandoned one must sacrifice everything to realize or serve ka just as arjuna did arjuna did not want to kill his family members but when he understood that these family members were impediments to his ka realization he accepted the instruction of ka and fought and killed them in all cases one should be detached from the happiness and distress of family life because in this world one can never be fully happy or fully miserable happiness and distress are concommitant factors of material life one should learn to tolerate as advised in bhagavadgt one can never restrict the coming and going of happiness and distress so one should be detached from the materialistic way of life and be automatically equiposed in both cases generally when we get something desirable we are very happy and when we get something undesirable we are distressed but if we are actually in the spiritual position these things will not agitate us to reach that stage we have to practice unbreakable devotional service devotional service to ka without deviation means engaging oneself in the nine processes of devotional service chanting hearing worshiping offering respect etc as described in the last verse of the ninth chapter that process should be followed naturally when one is adapted to the spiritual way of life he will not want to mix with materialistic men that would go against his grain one may test himself by seeing how far he is inclined to live in a solitary place without unwanted association naturally a devotee has no taste for unnecessary sporting or cinemagoing or enjoying some social function because he understands that these are simply a waste of time there are many research scholars and philosophers who study sex life or some other subject but according to bhagavadgt such research work and philosophical speculation have no value that is more or less nonsensical according to bhagavadgt one should make research by philosophical discretion into the nature of the soul one should make research to understand with what the self is concerned that is recommended here as far as selfrealization is concerned it is clearly stated here that bhaktiyoga is especially practical as soon as there is a question of devotion one must consider the relationship between the supersoul and the individual soul the individual soul and the supersoul cannot be one at least not in the bhakti conception the devotional conception of life this service of the individual soul to the supreme soul is eternal nityam as is clearly stated so bhakti or devotional service is eternal one should be established in that philosophical conviction otherwise it is only a waste of time ignorance in the rmadbhgavatam this is explained vadanti tat tattvavidas tattva yaj jnam advayam those who are actually knowers of the absolute truth know that the self is realized in three different phases as brahman paramtm and bhagavn bhg 1211 bhagavn is the last word in the realization of the absolute truth therefore one should reach up to that platform of understanding the supreme personality of godhead and thus engage in the devotional service of the lord that is perfection of knowledge beginning from practicing humility up to the point of realization of the supreme truth the absolute personality of godhead this process is just like a staircase beginning from the ground floor up to the top floor now on this staircase there are so many people who have reached the first floor the second or third floor etc but unless one reaches the top floor which is the understanding of ka he is at a lower stage of knowledge if anyone wants to compete with god and at the same time make advancement in spiritual knowledge he will be frustrated it is clearly stated that without humility understanding is harmful to think oneself god is most puffed up although the living entity is always being kicked by the stringent laws of material nature still he thinks i am god because of ignorance one should be humble and know that he is subordinate to the supreme lord due to rebellion against the supreme lord one becomes subordinate to material nature one must know and be convinced of this truth text 13 jeya yat tat pravakymi yaj jtvmtam anute andi matpara brahma

brahman the spirit and it lies beyond the cause and effect of this material world purport the lord has explained the field of activities and the knower of the field he has also explained the process of knowing the knower of the field of activities now he is explaining the knowable both the soul and the supersoul respectively by knowledge of the knower both the soul and the supersoul one can relish the nectar of life as explained in the second chapter the living entity is eternal this is also confirmed here there is no specific date at which the jva was born nor can anyone trace out the history of jvtms manifestation from the supreme lord therefore it is beginningless the vedic literature confirms this na jyate mjayate v vipacit the knower of the body is never born and never dies and he is full of knowledge the supreme lord is also stated in the vedic literature as pradhna ketrajapatir guea the supreme lord as the supersoul is the chief knower of the body and he is the master of the three modes of material nature in the smti it is said dsabhto harer eva nnyasvaiva kadcana the living entities are eternally in the service of the supreme lord this is also confirmed by lord caitanya in his teaching therefore the description of brahman mentioned in this verse is in relation to the individual soul and when the word brahman is applied to the living entity it is to be understood that he is vijna brahma as opposed to anantabrahma anantabrahma is the supreme brahman personality of godhead text 14 sarvata pipda tat sarvato kiiromukham sarvata rutimal loke sarvam vtya

translation everywhere are his hands and legs his eyes and faces and he hears everything in this way the supersoul exists purport as the sun exists diffusing its unlimited rays so does the supersoul or supreme personality of godhead he exists in his allpervading form and in him exist all the individual living entities beginning from the first great teacher brahm down to the small ants there are unlimited heads legs hands and eyes and unlimited living entities all are existing in and on the supersoul therefore the supersoul is allpervading the individual soul however cannot say that he has his hands legs and eyes everywhere that is not possible if he thinks that although under ignorance he is not conscious that his hands and legs are diffused all over but when he attains to proper knowledge he will come to that stage his thinking is contradictory this means that the individual soul having become conditioned by material nature is not supreme the supreme is different from the individual soul the supreme lord can extend his hand without limit the individual soul cannot in bhagavadgt the lord says that if anyone offers him a flower or a fruit or a little water he accepts if the lord is a far distance away how can he accept things this is the omnipotence of the lord even though he is situated in his own abode far far away from earth he can extend his hand to accept what anyone offers that is his potency in the brahmsahit it is stated goloka eva nivasati although he is always engaged in pastimes in his transcendental planet he is allpervading the individual soul cannot claim that he is allpervading therefore this verse describes the supreme soul the personality of godhead not the individual soul text 15 sarvendriyagubhsa sarvendriyavivarjitam asakta sarvabhc

although he is the maintainer of all living beings he transcends the modes of nature and at the same time he is the master of all modes of material nature purport the supreme lord although the source of all the senses of the living entities doesnt have material senses like they have actually the individual souls have spiritual senses but in conditioned life they are covered with the material elements and therefore the sense activities are exhibited through matter the supreme lords senses are not so covered his senses are transcendental and are therefore called nirgua gua means the material modes but his senses are without material covering it should be understood that his senses are not exactly like ours although he is the source of all our sensual activities he has his transcendental senses which are uncontaminated this is very nicely explained in the vetvatara upaniad in the verse sarvata pipdam the supreme personality of godhead has no hands which are materially contaminated but he has his hands and accepts whatever sacrifice is offered to him that is the distinction between the conditioned soul and the supersoul he has no material eyes but he has eyesotherwise how could he see he sees everything past present and future he lives within the heart of the living being and he knows what we have done in the past what we are doing now and what is awaiting us in the future this is also confirmed in bhagavadgt he knows everything but no one knows him it is said that the supreme lord has no legs like us but he can travel throughout space because he has spiritual legs in other words the lord is not impersonal he has his eyes legs hands and everything else and because we are part and parcel of the supreme lord we also have these things but his hands legs eyes and senses are not contaminated by material nature bhagavadgt also confirms that when the lord appears he appears as he is by his internal potency he is not contaminated by the material energy because he is the lord of material energy in the vedic literature we find that his whole embodiment is spiritual he has his eternal form called saccidnandavigraha he is full of all opulence he is the proprietor of all wealth and the owner of all energy he is the most intelligent and is full of knowledge these are some of the symptoms of the supreme personality of godhead he is maintainer of all living entities and the witness of all activities as far as we can understand from vedic literature the supreme lord is always transcendental although we do not see his head face hands or legs he has them and when we are elevated to the transcendental situation then we can see the lords form due to materially contaminated senses we cannot see his form therefore the impersonalists who are still materially affected cannot understand the personality of godhead text 16 bahir anta ca bhtnm acara caram eva ca skmatvt tad avijeya drastha cntike ca tat bahioutside

translation the supreme truth exists both internally and externally in the moving and nonmoving he is beyond the power of the material senses to see or to know although far far away he is also near to all purport in vedic literature we understand that nryaa the supreme person is residing both outside and inside of every living entity he is present both in the spiritual and material world although he is far far away still he is near to us these are the statements of vedic literature sno dra vrajati ayno yti sarvata and because he is always engaged in transcendental bliss we cannot understand how he is enjoying his full opulence we cannot see or understand with these material senses therefore in the vedic language it is said that to understand him our material mind and senses cannot act but one who has purified his mind and senses by practicing ka consciousness in devotional service can see him constantly it is confirmed in brahmasahit that the devotee who has developed love for the supreme god can see him always without cessation and it is confirmed in bhagavadgt 1154 that he can be seen and understood only by devotional service bhakty tvananyay akya text 17 avibhakta ca bhteu

although he is the maintainer of every living entity it is to be understood that he devours and develops all purport the lord is situated in everyones heart as the supersoul does that mean that he has become divided no actually he is one the example is given of the sun the sun at the meridian is situated in his place but if one goes for five thousand miles in all directions and asks where is the sun everyone will say that it is shining on his head in the vedic literature this example is given to show that although he is undivided he is situated as if divided also it is said in vedic literature that one viu is present everywhere by his omnipotence just as the sun appears in many places to many persons and the supreme lord although the maintainer of every living entity devours everything at the time of annihilation this was confirmed in the eleventh chapter when the lord said that he has come to devour all the warriors assembled at kuruketra he also mentions that in the form of time he devours also he is the annihilator the killer of all when there is creation he develops all from their original state and at the time of annihilation he devours them the vedic hymns confirm the fact that he is the origin of all living entities and the rest of al1 after creation everything rests in his omnipotence and after annihilation everything again returns to rest in him

light in all luminous objects like the sun moon stars etc in the vedic literature we find that in the spiritual kingdom there is no need of sun or moon because the effulgence of the supreme lord is there in the material world that brahmajyoti the lords spiritual effulgence is covered by the mahattattva the material elements therefore in this material world we require the assistance of sun moon electricity etc for light but in the spiritual world there is no need of such things it is clearly stated in the vedic literature that because of his luminous effulgence everything is illuminated it is clear therefore that his situation is not in the material world he is situated in the spiritual world which is far far away in the spiritual sky that is also confirmed in the vedic literature dityavaram tamasa parastt he is just like the sun eternally luminous but he is far far beyond the darkness of this material world his knowledge is transcendental the vedic literature confirms that brahman is concentrated transcendental knowledge to one who is anxious to be transferred to that spiritual world knowledge is given by the supreme lord who is situated in everyones heart one vedic mantra says ta ha devam tmabuddhipraka mumukur vai araam aham prapadye one must surrender unto the supreme personality of godhead if he at all wants liberation as far as the goal of ultimate knowledge is concerned it is also confirmed in vedic literature tam eva viditvtimtyum eti only by knowing you can one surpass the boundary of birth and death he is situated in everyones heart as the supreme controller the supreme has legs and hands distributed everywhere and this cannot be said of the individual soul therefore that there are two knowers of the field of activity the individual soul and the supersoul must be admitted ones hands and legs are distributed locally but kas hands and legs are distributed everywhere this is confirmed in the vetvatara upaniad sarvasya prabhum na sarvasya araa bhat that supreme personality of godhead supersoul is the prabhu or master of all living entities therefore he is the ultimate center of all living entities so there is no denying the fact that the supreme supersoul and the individual soul are always different text 19 iti ketra tath jna jeya coktu samsata madbhakta etad vijya madbhvyopapadyate itithus ketramfield of activities the body

knowledge can be understood by the unalloyed devotees of the lord directly others are unable to understand the monists say that at the ultimate stage these three items become one but the devotees do not accept this knowledge and development of knowledge mean understanding oneself in ka consciousness we are being led by material consciousness but as soon as we transfer all consciousness to kas

supreme personality of godhead the living entity is in the category of his energy and the supersoul is in the category of his personal expansion both material nature and the living entity are eternal that is to say that they existed before the creation the material manifestation is from the energy of the supreme lord and so also are the living entities but they are of the superior energy both of them existed before this cosmos was manifested material nature was absorbed in the supreme personality of godhead mahviu and when it was required it was manifested by the agency of mahattattva similarly the living entities are also in him and because they are conditioned they are adverse to serving the supreme lord thus they are not allowed to enter into the spiritual sky after the winding up of material nature these living entities are again given a chance to act in the material world and prepare themselves to enter into the spiritual world that is the mystery of this material creation actually the living entity is originally the spiritual part and parcel of the supreme lord but due to his rebellious nature he is conditioned within material nature it really does not matter how these living entities or superior entities of the supreme lord have come in contact with material nature the supreme personality of godhead knows however how and why this actually took place in the scriptures the lord says that those attracted by this material nature are undergoing a hard struggle for existence but we should know it with certainty from the descriptions of these few verses that all the transformations and influences of material nature by the three modes are also productions of material nature all transformations and variety in respect to living entities are due to the body as far as spirit is concerned living entities are all the same text 21 kryakraakarttve hetu praktir ucyate purua sukhadukhn bhokttve hetur ucyate kryaeffect kraacause karttvein the matter of creation hetu instrument praktimaterial nature ucyateis said to be purua the living entities sukhahappiness dukhnmof distresses bhokttve in enjoyment hetuinstrument ucyateissaid to be translation nature is said to be the cause of all material activities and effects whereas the living entity is the cause of the various sufferings and enjoyments in this world purport the different manifestations of body and senses among the living entities are due to material nature there are 8400000 different species of life and these varieties are the creation of the material nature they arise from the different sensual pleasures of the living entity who thus desires to live in this body or that when he is put into different bodies he enjoys different kinds of happiness and distress his material happiness and distress are due to his body and not to himself as he is in his original state there is no doubt of enjoyment therefore that is his real state because of the desire to lord it over material nature he is in the material world in the spiritual world there is no such thing the spiritual world is pure but in the material world everyone is struggling hard to acquire victims who present different pleasures to the body it might be more clear to state that this body is the effect of the senses the senses are instruments for gratifying desire now the sum totalbody and instrument sensesare offered by material nature and as will be clear in the next verse the living entity is blessed or damned with circumstances according to his past desire and activity according to ones desires and activities material nature places one in various residential quarters the being himself is the cause of his attaining such residential quarters and his attendant enjoyment or suffering once placed in some particular kind of body he comes under the control of nature because the body being matter acts according to the laws of nature at that time the living entity has no power to change that law suppose an entity is put into the body of a dog as soon as he is put into the body of a dog he must act like a dog he cannot act otherwise and if the living entity is put into the body of a hog then he is forced to eat stool and act like a hog similarly if the living entity is put into the body of a demigod he must act according to his body this is the law of nature but in all circumstances the supersoul is with the individual soul that is explained in the vedas as follows dv supar sayuj sakhy the supreme lord is so kind upon the living entity that he always accompanies the individual soul and in all circumstances is present as the supersoul or paramtm text 22 purua praktistho hi bhukte praktijn gun kraa guasagosya sadasadyonijanmasu puruathe living entity praktisthabeing situated in

and bad yonispecies of life janmasubirth translation the living entity in material nature thus follows the ways of life enjoying the three modes of nature this is due to his association with that material nature thus he meets with good and evil amongst various species purport this verse is very important for an understanding of how the living entities transmigrate from one body to another it is explained in the second chapter that the living entity is transmigrating from one body to another just as one changes dress this change of dress is due to his attachment to material existence as long as he is captivated by this false manifestation he has to continue transmigrating from one body to another due to his desire to lord it over material nature he is put into such undesirable circumstances under the influence of material desire the entity is born sometimes as a demigod sometimes as a man sometimes as a beast as a bird as a worm as an aquatic as a saintly man as a bug this is going on and in all cases the living entity thinks himself to be the master of his circumstances yet he is under the influence of material nature how he is put into such different bodies is explained here it is due to association with the different modes of nature one has to rise therefore above the three material modes and become situated in the transcendental position that is called ka consciousness unless one is situated in ka consciousness his material consciousness will oblige him to transfer from one body to another because he has material desires since time immemorial but he has to change that conception that change can be effected only by hearing from authoritative sources the best example is here arjuna is hearing the science of god from ka the living entity if he submits to this hearing process will lose his longcherished desire to dominate material nature and gradually and proportionately as he reduces his long desire to dominate he comes to enjoy spiritual happiness in a vedic mantra it is said that as he becomes learned in association with the supreme personality of godhead he proportionately relishes his eternal blissful life text 23 upadranumant ca bhart bhokt mahevara paramtmeti cpy ukto dehesmin purua para upadraoverseer anumantpermitter caalso bhartmaster bhoktsupreme enjoyer mahevarathe supreme lord paramtm supersoul itialso caand api uktais said dehein this body asmin this puruaenjoyer paratranscendental translation yet in this body there is another a transcendental enjoyer who is the lord the supreme proprietor who exists as the overseer and permitter and who is known as the supersoul purport it is stated here that the supersoul who is always with the individual soul is the representation of the supreme lord he is not an ordinary living entity because the monist philosophers take the knower of the body to be one they think that there is no difference between the supersoul and the individual soul to clarify this the lord says that he is the representation of paramtm in every body he is different from the individual soul he is para transcendental the individual soul enjoys the activities of a particular field but the supersoul is present not as finite enjoyer nor as one taking part in bodily activities but as the witness overseer permitter and supreme enjoyer his name is paramtm not tm and he is transcendental it is distinctly clear that the tm and paramtm are different the supersoul the paramtm has legs and hands everywhere but the individual soul does not and because he is the supreme lord he is present within to sanction the individual souls desiring material enjoyment without the sanction of the supreme soul the individual soul cannot do anything the individual is bhakta or the sustained and he is bhukta or the maintainer there are innumerable living entities and he is staying in them as a friend the fact is that individual living entities are eternally part and parcel of the supreme lord and both of them are very intimately related as friends but the living entity has the tendency to reject the sanction of the supreme lord and act independently in an attempt to dominate the supreme nature and because he has this tendency he is called the marginal energy of the supreme lord the living entity can be situated either in the material energy or the spiritual energy as long as he is conditioned by the material energy the supreme lord as his friend the supersoul stays with him just to get him to return to the spiritual energy the lord is always eager to take him back to the spiritual energy but due to his minute independence the individual entity is continually rejecting the association of spiritual light this misuse of independence is the cause of his material strife in the conditioned nature the lord therefore is always giving instruction from within and from without from without he gives instructions as stated in bhagavadgt and from within he tries to convince him that his activities in the material field are not conducive to real happiness just give it up and turn your faith toward me then you will be happy he says thus the intelligent person who places his faith in the paramtm or the supreme personality of godhead begins to advance toward a blissful eternal life of knowledge text 24 ya eva vetti purua prakti ca guai saha sarvath vartamnopi na sa bhyo

liberation he will not take birth here again regardless of his present position purport clear understanding of material nature the supersoul the individual soul and their interrelation makes one eligible to become liberated and turn to the spiritual atmosphere without being forced to return to this material nature this is the result of knowledge the purpose of knowledge is to understand distinctly that the living entity has by chance fallen into this material existence by his personal endeavor in association with authorities saintly persons and a spiritual master he has to understand his position and then revert to spiritual consciousness or ka consciousness by understanding bhagavadgt as it is explained by the personality of godhead then it is certain that he will never come again into this material existence he will be transferred into the spiritual world for a blissful eternal life of knowledge text 25 dhynentmani payanti kecid tmnam tman anye skhyena yogena karmayogena

desire caalso apareothers translation that supersoul is perceived by some through meditation by some through the cultivation of knowledge and by others through working without fruitive desire purport the lord informs arjuna that the conditioned soul can be divided into two classes as far as mans search for selfrealization is concerned those who are atheists agnostics and skeptics are beyond the sense of spiritual understanding but there are others who are faithful in their understanding of spiritual life and they are called workers who have renounced fruitive results those who always try to establish the doctrine of monism are also counted among the atheists and agnostics in other words only the devotees of the supreme personality of godhead are really capable of spiritual understanding because they understand that beyond this material nature there is the spiritual world and the supreme personality of godhead who is expanded as the paramtm the supersoul in everyone the allpervading godhead of course there are those who try to understand the supreme absolute truth by cultivation of knowledge and they can be counted in the second class the atheistic philosophers analyze this material world into twentyfour elements and they place the individual soul as the twenty fifth item when they are able to understand the nature of the individual soul to be transcendental to the material elements they are able to understand also that above the individual soul there is the supreme personality of godhead he is the twentysixth element thus gradually they also come to the standard of devotional service in ka consciousness those who work without fruitive results are also perfect in their attitude they are given a chance to advance to the platform of devotional service in ka consciousness here it is stated that there are some people who are pure in consciousness and who try to find out the supersoul by meditation and when they discover the supersoul within themselves they become transcendentally situated similarly there are others who also try to understand the supreme soul by cultivation of knowledge and there are others who cultivate the hahayoga system and who try to satisfy the supreme personality of godhead by childish activities text 26 anye tv evam ajnanta rutvnyebhya upsate tepi ctitaranty eva mtyu rutiparya anyeothers tubut evamthis

process of hearing translation again there are those who although not conversant in spiritual knowledge begin to worship the supreme person upon hearing about him from others because of their tendency to hear from authorities they also transcend the path of birth and death purport this verse is particularly applicable to modern society because in modern society there is practically no education in spiritual matters some of the people may appear to be atheistic or agnostic or philosophical but actually there is no knowledge of philosophy as for the common man if he is a good soul then there is a chance for advancement by hearing this hearing process is very important lord caitanya who preached ka consciousness in the modern world gave great stress to hearing because if the common man simply hears from authoritative sources he can progress especially according to lord caitanya if he hears the transcendental vibration hare ka hare ka ka ka hare harehare rma hare rma rma rma hare hare it is stated therefore that all men should take advantage of hearing from realized souls and gradually become able to understand everything the worship of the supreme lord will then undoubtedly take place lord caitanya has said that in this age no one needs to change his position but one should give up the endeavor to understand the absolute truth by speculative reasoning one should learn to become the servant of those who are in knowledge of the supreme lord if one is fortunate enough to take shelter of a pure devotee hear from him about selfrealization and follow in his footsteps he will be gradually elevated to the position of a pure devotee in this verse particularly the process of hearing is strongly recommended and this is very appropriate although the common man is often not as capable as socalled philosophers faithful hearing from an authoritative person will help one transcend this material existence and go back to godhead back to home text 27 yvat sajyate kicit sattva

the field of activities and the knower of the field purport both material nature and the living entity which were existing before the creation of the cosmos are explained in this verse whatever is created is but a combination of the living entity and material nature there are many manifestations like trees mountains and hills which are not moving and there are many existences which are moving and all of them are but combinations of material nature and superior nature the living entity without the touch of the superior nature the living entity nothing can grow therefore the relationship between matter and nature is eternally going on and this combination is effected by the supreme lord therefore he is the controller of both the superior and inferior natures the material nature is created by him and the superior nature is placed in this material nature and thus all these activities and manifestations take place text 28 sama sarveu bhteu tihanta paramevaram vinayatsv avinayanta

body both the soul and the supersoul exist and they go on eternally in many various moving and unmoving forms the sanskrit word paramevaram is sometimes translated as the individual soul because the soul is the master of the body and after the destruction of the body he transfers to another form in that way he is master but there are others who interpret this paramevaram to be the supersoul in either case both the supersoul and the individual soul continue they are not destroyed one who can see in this way can actually see what is happening text 29 sama payan hi sarvatra samavasthitam varam

supreme is situated in his paramtm manifestation everywhere that is if one can see the presence of the supreme personality of godhead in every living thing he does not degrade himself and he therefore gradually advances in the spiritual world the mind is generally addicted to selfcentered processes but when the mind turns to the supersoul one becomes advanced in spiritual understanding text 30

whatever one is supposed to do either for happiness or for distress one is forced to do because of the bodily constitution the self however is outside all these bodily activities this body is given according to ones past desires to fulfill desires one is given the body with which he acts accordingly practically speaking the body is a machine designed by the supreme lord to fulfill desires because of desires one is put into difficult circumstances to suffer or to enjoy this transcendental vision of the living entity when developed makes one separate from bodily activities one who has such a vision is an actual seer text 31 yad bhtapthagbhvam ekastham anupayati tata eva ca vistra brahma sampadyate tad yadwhen bhtaliving entities pthakbhvamseparated entities ekasthamsituated in one

entities arise due to the different desires of the individual soul and do not actually belong to the soul itself one actually sees in the material conception of life we find someone a demigod someone a human being a dog a cat etc this is material vision not actual vision this material differentiation is due to a material conception of life after the destruction of the material body this spirit soul is one the spirit soul due to contact with material nature gets different types of bodies when one can see this he attains spiritual vision thus being freed from differentiations like man animal big low etc one becomes beautified in his consciousness and able to develop ka consciousness in his spiritual identity how he then sees things will be explained in the next verse text 32 anditvn

eternal and beyond the modes of nature despite contact with the material body o arjuna the soul neither does anything nor is entangled purport a living entity appears to be born because of the birth of the material body but actually the living entity is eternal he is not born and in spite of his being situated in a material body he is transcendental and eternal thus he cannot be destroyed by nature he is full of bliss he does not engage himself in any material activities therefore the activities performed due to his contact with material bodies do not entangle him text 33 yath sarvagata

does not mix with the body though situated in that body purport the air enters into water mud stool and whatever else is there still it does not mix with anything similarly the living entity even though situated in varieties of bodies is aloof from them due to his subtle nature therefore it is impossible to see with the material eyes how the living entity is in contact with this body and how he is out of it after the destruction of the body no one in science can ascertain this text 34 yath prakayaty eka ktsna lokam ima ravi ketra ketr tath ktsna prakayati bhrata yathas

bharata as the sun alone illuminates all this universe so does the living entity one within the body illuminate the entire body by consciousness purport there are various theories regarding consciousness here in bhagavadgt the example of the sun and the sunshine is given as the sun is situated in one place but is illuminating the whole universe so a small particle of spirit soul although situated in the heart of this body is illuminating the whole body by consciousness thus consciousness is the proof of the presence of the soul as sunshine or light is the proof of the presence of the sun when the soul is present in the body there is consciousness all over the body and as soon as the soul has passed from the body there is no more consciousness this can be easily understood by any intelligent man therefore consciousness is not a production of the combinations of matter it is the symptom of the living entity the consciousness of the living entity although qualitatively one with the supreme consciousness is not supreme because the consciousness of one particular body does not share that of another body but the supersoul which is situated in all bodies as the friend of the individual soul is conscious of all bodies that is the difference between supreme consciousness and individual consciousness text 35 ketraketrajayor evam antara jnacaku bhtapraktimoka ca ye vidur ynti

yntiapproaches tethey paramsupreme translation one who knowingly sees this difference between the body and the owner of the body and can understand the process of liberation from this bondage also attains to the supreme goal purport the purport of this thirteenth chapter is that one should know the distinction between the body the owner of the body and the supersoul a faithful person should at first have some good association to hear of god and thus gradually become enlightened if one accepts a spiritual master he can learn to distinguish between matter and spirit and that becomes the steppingstone for further spiritual realization a spiritual master teaches his students to get free from the material concept of life by various instructions for instance in bhagavadgt we find ka instructing arjuna to free him from materialistic considerations one can understand that this body is matter it can be analyzed with its twentyfour elements that is the gross manifestation and the subtle manifestation is the mind and psychological effects and the symptoms of life are the interaction of these features but over and above this there is the soul and there is also the supersoul the soul and the supersoul are two this material world is working by the conjunction of the soul and the twentyfour material elements one who can see the constitution of the whole material manifestation as this combination of the soul and material elements and also can see the situation of the supreme soul becomes eligible for transfer to the spiritual world these things are meant for contemplation and for realization and one should have a complete understanding of this chapter with the help of the spiritual master thus end the bhaktivedanta purports to the thirteenth chapter of the rmadbhagavadgt in the matter of nature the enjoyer and consciousness chapter fourteen the three modes of material nature text 1 r bhagavn uvca para bhya pravakymi jnn jnam uttamam yaj jtv munaya sarve

knowledge knowing which all the sages have attained to supreme perfection purport from the seventh chapter to the end of the twelfth chapter r ka in detail reveals the absolute truth the supreme personality of godhead now the lord himself is further enlightening arjuna if one understands this chapter through the process of philosophical speculation he will come to an understanding of devotional service in the thirteenth chapter it was clearly explained that by humbly developing knowledge one may possibly be freed from material entanglement it has also been explained that it is due to association with the modes of nature that the living entity is entangled in this material world now in this chapter the supreme personality explains what those modes of nature are how they act how they bind and how they give liberation the knowledge explained in this chapter is proclaimed by the supreme lord to be superior to the knowledge given so far in other chapters by understanding this knowledge various great sages attain perfection and transfer to the spiritual world the lord now explains the same knowledge in a better way this knowledge is far far superior to all other processes of knowledge thus far explained and knowing this many attain perfection thus it is expected that one who understands this fourteenth chapter will attain perfection text 2 ida jnam upritya mama

pralayein the annihilation nanor vyathantidisturbed caalso translation by becoming fixed in this knowledge one can attain to the transcendental nature which is like my own nature thus established one is not born at the time of creation nor disturbed at the time of dissolution purport after acquiring perfect transcendental knowledge one acquires qualitative equality with the supreme personality of godhead becoming free from the repetition of birth and death one does not however lose his identity as an individual soul it is understood from vedic literature that the liberated souls who have reached the transcendental planets of the spiritual sky always look to the lotus feet of the supreme lord being engaged in his transcendental loving service so even after liberation the devotees do not lose their individual identities generally in the material world whatever knowledge we get is contaminated by the three modes of material nature but knowledge which is not contaminated by the three modes of nature is called transcendental knowledge as soon as one is situated in that transcendental knowledge he is on the same platform as that of the supreme person those who have no knowledge of the spiritual sky hold that after being freed from the material activities of the material form this spiritual identity becomes formless without any variegatedness however just as there is material variegatedness in this world so in the spiritual world there is also variegatedness those in ignorance of this think that spiritual existence is opposed to material variety but actually in the spiritual sky one attains spiritual form there are spiritual activities and the spiritual situation is called devotional life that atmosphere is said to be uncontaminated and there one is equal in quality with the supreme lord to obtain such knowledge one must develop all the spiritual qualities one who thus develops the spiritual qualities is not affected either by the creation or the destruction of the material world text 3 mama yonir mahadbrahma tasmin garbha dadhmy aham sambhava sarvabhtn tato bhavati bhrata mamamy yonisource of birth mahatthe total material existence

material substance called brahman is the source of birth and it is that brahman that i impregnate making possible the births of all living beings o son of bharata purport this is an explanation of the world everything that takes place is due to the combination of ketra and ketraja the body and the spirit soul this combination of material nature and the living entity is made possible by the supreme god himself the mahattattva is the total cause of the total cosmic manifestation and because in the total substance of the material cause there are three modes of nature it is sometimes called brahman the supreme personality impregnates that total substance and thus innumerable universes become possible this total material substance the mahattattva is described as brahman in the vedic literature tasmd etad brahma nmarpam anna ca jyate into that brahman the seeds of the living entities are impregnated by the supreme person the twentyfour elements beginning from earth water fire and air are all material energy called mahbrahman or the great brahman the material nature as is explained in the seventh chapter beyond this there is another superior naturethe living entity in material nature the superior nature is mixed by the will of the supreme personality of godhead and thereafter all living entities are born of this material nature the scorpion lays its eggs in piles of rice and sometimes it is said that the scorpion is born out of rice but the rice is not the cause of the scorpion actually the eggs were laid by the mother similarly material nature is not the cause of the birth of the living entities the seed is given by the supreme personality of godhead and they only seem to come out as products of material nature thus every living entity according to his past activities has a different body created by this material nature and the entity can enjoy or suffer according to his past deeds the lord is the cause of all the manifestations of living entities in this material world

possible by birth in this material nature and that i am the seedgiving father purport in this verse it is clearly explained that the supreme personality of godhead ka is the original father of all living entities the living entities are combinations of the material nature and the spiritual nature such living entities are seen not only on this planet but in every planet even in the highest where brahm is situated everywhere there are living entities within the earth there are living entities even within water and within fire all these appearances are due to the mother material nature and kas seedgiving process the purport is that the living entities being impregnated in the material world come out and form at the time of creation according to their past deeds text 5 sattva rajas tama iti

comes in contact with nature he becomes conditioned by these modes purport the living entity because he is transcendental has nothing to do with this material nature still because he has become conditioned by the material world he is acting under the spell of the three modes of material nature because living entities have different kinds of bodies in terms of the different aspects of nature they are induced to act according to that nature this is the cause of the varieties of happiness and distress text 6 tatra sattva nirmalatvt prakakam anmayam sukhasagena badhnti jnasagena cnagha

jnaknowledge sagenaassociation caalso anaghao sinless one translation o sinless one the mode of goodness being purer than the others is illuminating and it frees one from all sinful reactions those situated in that mode develop knowledge but they become conditioned by the concept of happiness purport the living entities conditioned by material nature are of various types one is happy another is very active and another is helpless all these types of psychological manifestations are causes of the entities conditioned status in nature how they are differently conditioned is explained in this section of bhagavadgt the mode of goodness is first considered the effect of developing the mode of goodness in the material world is that one becomes wiser than those otherwise conditioned a man in the mode of goodness is not so much affected by material miseries and he has a sense of advancement in material knowledge the representative type is the brhmaa who is supposed to be situated in the mode of goodness this sense of happiness is due to understanding that in the mode of goodness one is more or less free from sinful reactions actually in the vedic literature it is said that the mode of goodness means greater knowledge and a greater sense of happiness the difficulty here is that when a living entity is situated in the mode of goodness he becomes conditioned to feel that he is advanced in knowledge and is better than others in this way he becomes conditioned the best examples are the scientist and philosopher each is very proud of his knowledge and because they generally improve their living conditions they feel a sort of material happiness this sense of advanced happiness in conditioned life makes them bound by the mode of goodness of material nature as such they are attracted toward working in the mode of goodness and as long as they have an attraction for working in that way they have to take some type of body in the modes of nature thus there is no likelihood of liberation or of being transferred to the spiritual world repeatedly one may become a philosopher a scientist or a poet and repeatedly become entangled in the same disadvantages of birth and death but due to the illusion of the material energy one thinks that that sort of life is pleasant text 7 rajo rgtmaka viddhi tsagasamudbhavam tan nibadhnti kaunteya karmasagena dehinam rajamode of passion rgatmakamborn of desire or lust viddhi know thankering sagaassociation samudbhavamproduced of tatthat nibadhntiis bound kaunteyao son of kunt karmasagena association with fruitive activity dehinamof the embodied translation the mode of passion is born of unlimited desires and longings o son of kunt and because of this one is bound to material fruitive activities purport the mode of passion is characterized by the attraction between man and woman woman has attraction for man and man has attraction for woman this is called the mode of passion and when the mode of passion is increased one develops the hankering for material enjoyment he wants to enjoy sense gratification for sense gratification a man in the mode of passion wants some honor in society or in the nation and he wants to have a happy family with nice children wife and house these are the products of the mode of passion as long as one is hankering after these things he has to work very hard therefore it is clearly stated here that he becomes associated with the fruits of his activities and thus becomes bound by such activities in order to please his wife children and society and to keep up his prestige one has to work therefore the whole material world is more or less in the mode of passion modern civilization is considered to be advanced in the standards of the mode of passion formerly the advanced condition was considered to be in the mode of goodness if there is no liberation for those in the mode of goodness what of those who are entangled in the mode of passion text 8 tamas tv ajnaja viddhi

lasyaindolence nidrbhisleep tatthat nibadhntibinds bhratao son of bharata translation o son of bharata the mode of ignorance causes the delusion of all living entities the result of this mode is madness indolence and sleep which bind the conditioned soul purport in this verse the specific application of the word tu is very significant this means that the mode of ignorance is a very peculiar qualification of the embodied soul this mode of ignorance is just the opposite of the mode of goodness in the mode of goodness by development of knowledge one can understand what is what but the mode of ignorance is just the opposite everyone under the spell of the mode of ignorance becomes mad and a madman cannot understand what is what instead of making advancement one becomes degraded the definition of the mode of ignorance is stated in the vedic literature under the spell of ignorance one cannot understand the thing as it is for example everyone can see that his grandfather has died and therefore he will also die man is mortal the children that he conceives will also die so death is sure still people are madly accumulating money and working very hard all day and night not caring for the eternal spirit this is madness in their madness they are very reluctant to make advancement in spiritual understanding such people are very lazy when they are invited to associate for spiritual understanding they are not much interested they are not even active like the man who is controlled by the mode of passion thus another symptom of one embedded in the mode of ignorance is that he sleeps more than is required six hours of sleep is sufficient but a man in the mode of ignorance sleeps at least ten or twelve hours a day such a man appears to be always dejected and is addicted to intoxicants and sleeping these are the symptoms of a person conditioned by the mode of ignorance text 9 sattva sukhe sajayati raja karmai bhrata jnam vtya tu tama pramde sajayaty uta

madness sajayatidevelops utait is said translation the mode of goodness conditions one to happiness passion conditions him to the fruits of action and ignorance to madness purport a person in the mode of goodness is satisfied by his work or intellectual pursuit just as a philosopher scientist or educator may be engaged in a particular field of knowledge and may be satisfied in that way a man in the modes of passion and goodness may be engaged in fruitive activity he owns as much as he can and spends for good causes sometimes he tries to open hospitals give to charity institutions etc these are the signs of one in the mode of passion and the mode of ignorance covers knowledge in the mode of ignorance whatever one does is neither good for him nor for anyone text 10 rajas tama cbhibhya sattva

the mode of passion becomes prominent defeating the mode of goodness o son of bharata and sometimes the mode of goodness defeats passion and at other times the mode of ignorance defeats goodness and passion in this way there is always competition for supremacy purport when the mode of passion is prominent the modes of goodness and ignorance are defeated when the mode of goodness is prominent passion and ignorance are defeated and when the mode of ignorance is prominent passion and goodness are defeated this competition is always going on therefore one who is actually intent on advancing in ka consciousness has to transcend these three modes the prominence of some certain mode of nature is manifested in ones dealings in his activities in eating etc all this will be explained in later chapters but if one wants he can develop by practice the mode of goodness and thus defeat the modes of ignorance and passion one can similarly develop the mode of passion and defeat goodness and ignorance or one can develop the mode of ignorance and defeat goodness and passion although there are these three modes of material nature if one is determined he can be blessed by the mode of goodness and by transcending the mode of goodness he can be situated in pure goodness which is called the vsudeva state a state in which one can understand the science of god by the manifestation of particular activities it can be understood in what mode of nature one is situated text 11 sarvadvreu dehesmin praka upajyate jna yad tad vidyd vivddha sattvam ity uta sarvadvreuall the gates dehe

right position one can hear things in the right position and one can taste things in the right position one becomes cleansed inside and outside in every gate there is development of the symptoms of

with the position he has already acquired he hankers to increase his position if he wants to construct a residential house he tries his best to have a palatial house as if he would be able to reside in that house eternally and he develops a great hankering for sense gratification there is no end to sense gratification he always wants to remain with his family and in his house and to continue the

there enjoys godly happiness the word amaln is significant it means free from the modes of passion and ignorance there are impurities in the material world but the mode of goodness is the purest form of existence in the material world there are different kinds of planets for different kinds of living entities those who die in the mode of goodness are elevated to the planets where great sages and great devotees live text 15 rajasi pralaya gatv karmasagiu jyate tath pralnas tamasi mhayoniu jyate rajasiin passion pralayamdissolution gatvattaining karmasagiu in the association of fruitive

engaged in fruitive activities and when he dies in the mode of ignorance he takes birth in the animal kingdom purport some people have the impression that when the soul reaches the platform of human life it never goes down again this is incorrect according to this verse if one develops the mode of ignorance after his death he is degraded to the animal form of life from there one has to again elevate himself by evolutionary process to come again to the human form of life therefore those who are actually serious about human life should take to the mode of goodness and in good association transcend the modes and become situated in ka consciousness this is the aim of human life otherwise there is no guarantee that the human being will again attain to the human status text 16 karmaa

passion result in distress and actions performed in the mode of ignorance result in foolishness purport by pious activities in the mode of goodness one is purified therefore the sages who are free from all illusion are situated in happiness similarly activities in the mode of passion are simply miserable any activity for material happiness is bound to be defeated if for example one wants to have a skyscraper so much human misery has to be undergone before a big skyscraper can be built the financier has to take much trouble to earn a mass of wealth and those who are slaving to construct the building have to render physical toil the miseries are there thus bhagavadgt says that in any activity performed under the spell of the mode of passion there is definitely great misery there may be a little socalled mental happinessi have this house or this moneybut this is not actual happiness as far as the mode of ignorance is concerned the performer is without knowledge and therefore all his activities result in present misery and afterwards he will go on toward animal life animal life is always miserable although under the spell of the illusory energy my the animals do not understand this slaughtering poor animals is also due to the mode of ignorance the animal killers do not know that in the future the animal will have a body suitable to kill them that is the law of nature in human society if one kills a man he has to be hanged that is the law of the state because of ignorance people do not perceive that there is a complete state controlled by the supreme lord every living creature is the son of the supreme lord and he does not tolerate even an ants being killed one has to pay for it so indulgence in animal killing for the taste of the tongue is the grossest kind of ignorance a human being has no need to kill animals because god has supplied so many nice things if one indulges in meateating anyway it is to be understood that he is acting in ignorance and is making his future very dark of all kinds of animal killing the killing of cows is most vicious because the cow gives us all kinds of pleasure by supplying milk cow slaughter is an act of the grossest type of ignorance in the vedic literature the words gobhi pritamatsaram indicate that one who being fully satisfied by milk is desirous of killing the cow is in the grossest ignorance there is also a prayer in the vedic literature that states namo brahmayadevya gobrhmaahitya ca jagaddhitya kya govindya namo nama my lord you are the wellwisher of the cows and the brhmaas and you are the wellwisher of the entire human society and world the purport is that special mention is given in that prayer for the protection of the cows and the brhmaas brhmaas are the symbol of spiritual education and cows are the symbol of the most valuable food these two living creatures the brhmaas and the cows must be given all protectionthat is real advancement of civilization in modern human society spiritual knowledge is neglected and cow killing is encouraged it is to be understood then that human society is advancing in the wrong direction and is clearing the path to its own condemnation a civilization which guides the citizens to become animals in their next lives is certainly not a human civilization the present human civilization is of course grossly misled by the modes of passion and ignorance it is a very dangerous age and all nations should take care to provide the easiest process ka consciousness to save humanity from the greatest danger text 17 sattvt sajyate jna rajaso lobha eva ca

society will develop the mode of goodness when the mode of goodness is developed people will see things as they are in the mode of ignorance people are just like animals and cannot see things clearly in the mode of ignorance for example they do not see that by killing one animal they are taking a chance of being killed by the same animal in the next life because people have no education in actual knowledge they become irresponsible to stop this irresponsibility education for developing the mode of goodness of the people in general must be there when they are actually educated in the mode of goodness they will become sober in full knowledge of things as they are then people will be happy and prosperous even if the majority of the people arent happy and prosperous if a certain percentage of the population develops ka consciousness and becomes situated in the mode of goodness then there is the possibility for peace and prosperity all over the world otherwise if the world is devoted to the modes of passion and ignorance there can be no peace or prosperity in the mode of passion people become greedy and their hankering for sense enjoyment has no limit one can see that even if one has enough money and adequate arrangement for sense gratification there is neither happiness nor peace of mind that is not possible because one is situated in the mode of passion if one wants happiness at all his money will not help him he has to elevate himself to the mode of goodness by practicing ka consciousness one engaged in the mode of passion is not only mentally unhappy but his profession and occupation are also very troublesome he has to devise so many plans and schemes to acquire enough money to maintain his status quo this is all miserable in the mode of ignorance people become mad being distressed by their circumstances they take shelter of intoxication and thus they sink further into ignorance their future in life is very dark text 18 rdhva gacchanti sattvasth madhye tihanti

planets those in the mode of passion live on the earthly planets and those in the mode of ignorance go down to the hellish worlds purport in this verse the results of actions in the three modes of nature are more explicitly set forth there is an upper planetary system consisting of the heavenly planets where everyone is highly elevated according to the degree of development of the mode of goodness the living entity can be transferred to various planets in this system the highest planet is satyaloka or brahmaloka where the prime person of this universe lord brahm resides we have seen already that we can hardly calculate the wondrous condition of life in brahmaloka but the highest condition of life the mode of goodness can bring us to this the mode of passion is mixed it is in the middle between the modes of goodness and ignorance a person is not always pure but even if he should be purely in the mode of passion he will simply remain on this earth as a king or a rich man but because there are mixtures one can also go down people on this earth in the modes of passion or ignorance cannot forcibly approach the higher planets by machine in the mode of passion there is also the chance of becoming mad in the next life the lowest quality the mode of ignorance is described here as abominable the result of developing ignorance is very very risky it is the lowest quality in material nature beneath the human level there are eight million species of life birds beasts reptiles trees etc and according to the development of the mode of ignorance people are brought down to these abominable conditions the word tmas is very significant here tmas indicates those who stay continually in the mode of ignorance without rising to a higher mode their future is very dark there is opportunity for men in the modes of ignorance and passion to be elevated to the mode of goodness and that system is called ka consciousness but one who does not take advantage of this opportunity certainly will continue in the lower modes text 19 nnya guebhya kartra yad dranupayati guebhya ca para vetti madbhva so dhigacchati nanever anyamother than guebhyafrom the qualities kartram the

that there is nothing beyond these modes of nature in all activities and that the supreme lord is transcendental to all these modes then you can know my spiritual nature purport one can transcend all the activities of the modes of material nature simply by understanding them properly by learning from the proper souls the real spiritual master is ka and he is imparting this spiritual knowledge to arjuna similarly it is from those who are fully in ka consciousness that one has to learn this science of activities in terms of the modes of nature otherwise ones life will be misdirected by the instruction of a bona fide spiritual master a living entity can know of his spiritual position his material body his senses how he is entrapped and how he is under the spell of the material modes of nature he is helpless being in the grip of these modes but when he can see his real position then he can attain to the transcendental platform having the scope for spiritual life actually the living entity is not the performer of different activities he is forced to act because he is situated in a particular type of body conducted by some particular mode of material nature unless one has the help of spiritual authority he cannot understand in what position he is actually situated with the association of a bona fide spiritual master he can see his real position and by such an understanding he can become fixed in full ka consciousness a man in ka consciousness is not controlled by the spell of the material modes of nature it has already been stated in the seventh chapter that one who has surrendered to ka is relieved from the activities of material nature therefore for one who is able to see things as they are the influence of material nature gradually ceases text 20 gun etn attya trn

enjoy nectar even in this life purport how one can stay in the transcendental position even in this body in full ka consciousness is explained in this verse the sanskrit word deh means embodied although one is within this material body by his advancement in spiritual knowledge he can be free from the influence of the modes of nature he can enjoy the happiness of spiritual life even in this body because after leaving this body he is certainly going to the spiritual sky but even in this body he can enjoy spiritual happiness in other words devotional service in ka consciousness is the sign of liberation from this material entanglement and this will be explained in the eighteenth chapter when one is freed from the influence of the modes of material nature he enters into devotional service text 21 arjuna uvca kair ligais trn gun etn atto bhavati prabho kim cra katha caits trn gun ativartate arjuna uvcaarjuna said kaiby which ligaisymptoms trn three gunqualities etnall this

of a person who has already transcended the material modes he first inquires of the symptoms of such a transcendental person how can one understand that he has already transcended the influence of the modes of material nature the second question asks how he lives and what his activities are are they regulated or nonregulated then arjuna inquires of the means by which he can attain the transcendental nature that is very important unless one knows the direct means by which one can be situated always transcendentally there is no possibility of showing the symptoms so all these questions put by arjuna are very important and the lord answers them texts 2225 rbhagavn uvca praka ca pravtti ca moham eva ca pava na dvei sampravttni na nivttni kkati udsnavad sno guair yo na

attachment and delusion when they are present nor longs for them when they disappear who is seated like one unconcerned being situated beyond these material reactions of the modes of nature who remains firm knowing that the modes alone are active who regards alike pleasure and pain and looks on a clod a stone and a piece of gold with an equal eye who is wise and holds praise and blame to be the same who is unchanged in honor and dishonor who treats friend and foe alike who has abandoned all fruitive undertakingssuch a man is said to have transcended the modes of nature purport arjuna submitted the three different questions and the lord answers them one after another in these verses ka first indicates that a person transcendentally situated neither envies anyone nor hankers for anything when a living entity stays in this material world embodied by the material body it is to be understood that he is under the control of one of the three modes of material nature when he is actually out of the body then he is out of the clutches of the material modes of nature but as long as he is not out of the material body he should be neutral he should engage himself in the devotional service of the lord so that his identity with the material body will automatically be forgotten when one is conscious of the material body he acts only for sense gratification but when one transfers the consciousness to ka sense gratification automatically stops one does not need this material body and he does not need to accept the dictations of the material body the qualities of the material modes in the body will act but as spirit soul the self is aloof from such activities how does he become aloof he does not desire to enjoy the body nor does he desire to get out of it thus transcendentally situated the devotee becomes automatically free he need not try to become free from the influence of the modes of material nature the next question concerns the dealings of a transcendentally situated person the materially situated person is affected by socalled honor and dishonor offered to the body but the transcendentally situated person is not affected by such false honor and dishonor he performs his duty in ka consciousness and does not mind whether a man honors or dishonors him he accepts things that are favorable for his duty in ka consciousness otherwise he has no necessity of anything material either a stone or gold he takes everyone as his dear friend who helps him in his execution of ka consciousness and he does not hate his socalled enemy he is equally disposed and sees everything on an equal level because he knows perfectly well that he has nothing to do with material existence social and political issues do not affect him because he knows the situation of temporary upheavals and disturbances he does not attempt anything for his own sake he can attempt anything for ka but for his personal self he does not attain anything by such behavior one becomes actually transcendentally situated text 26 m ca yo vyabhicrea bhaktiyogena sevate sa gun samattyaitn brahmabhyya kalpate mmunto me caalso yaperson avyabhicreawithout fail bhaktiyogenaby devotional service sevaterenders service sahe gunall the modes of material nature samattyatranscending etnall this brahmabhyyato be elevated on the brahman platform kalpate is considered translation one who engages in full devotional service who does not fall down in any circumstance at once transcends the modes of material nature and thus comes to the level of brahman purport this verse is a reply to arjunas third question what is the means of attaining to the transcendental position as explained before the material world is acting under the spell of the modes of material nature one should not be disturbed by the activities of the modes of nature instead of putting his consciousness into such activities he may transfer his consciousness to ka activities ka activities are known as bhakti yogaalways acting for ka this includes not only ka but his different plenary expansions such as rma and nryaa he has innumerable expansions one who is engaged in the service of any of the forms of ka or of his plenary expansions is considered to be transcendentally situated one should also note that all the forms of ka are fully transcendental blissful full of knowledge and eternal such personalities of godhead are omnipotent and omniscient and they possess all transcendental qualities so if one engages himself in the service of ka or his plenary expansions with unfailing determination although these modes of material nature are very difficult to overcome he can overcome them easily this is already explained in the seventh chapter one who surrenders unto ka at once surmounts the influence of the modes of material nature to be in ka consciousness or in devotional service means to acquire the equality of ka the lord says that his nature is eternal blissful and full of knowledge and the living entities are part and parcel of the supreme as gold particles are part of a gold mine thus the living entitys spiritual position is as good as gold as good as ka in quality the difference of individuality continues otherwise there is no question of bhaktiyoga bhaktiyoga means that the lord is there the devotee is there and the activity of exchange of love between the lord and the devotee is there therefore the individuality of two persons is present in the supreme personality of godhead and the individual person otherwise there is no meaning to bhaktiyoga if one is not situated in the same transcendental position with the lord one cannot serve the supreme lord to be a personal assistant to a king one must acquire the qualifications thus the qualification is to become brahman or freed from all material contamination it is said in the vedic literature brahmaiva san brahmpyeti one can attain the supreme brahman by becoming brahman this means that one must qualitatively become one with brahman by attainment of brahman one does not lose his eternal brahman identity as individual soul text 27 brahmao hi pratihham amtasyvyayasya ca

dharmasyaof the constitutional position sukhasyahappiness aikntikasyaultimate ca also translation and i am the basis of the impersonal brahman which is the constitutional position of ultimate happiness and which is immortal imperishable and eternal purport the constitution of brahman is immortality imperishability eternity and happiness brahman is the beginning of transcendental realization paramtm the supersoul is the middle the second stage in transcendental realization and the supreme personality of godhead is the ultimate realization of the absolute truth therefore both paramtm and the impersonal brahman are within the supreme person it is explained in the seventh chapter that material nature is the manifestation of the inferior energy of the supreme lord the lord impregnates the inferior material nature with the fragments of the superior nature and that is the spiritual touch in the material nature when a living entity conditioned by this material nature begins the cultivation of spiritual knowledge he elevates himself from the position of material existence and gradually rises up to the brahman conception of the supreme this attainment of the brahman conception of life is the first stage in selfrealization at this stage the brahman realized person is transcendental to the material position but he is not actually perfect in brahman realization if he wants he can continue to stay in the brahman position and then gradually rise up to paramtm realization and then to the realization of the supreme personality of godhead there are many examples of this in vedic literature the four kumras were situated first in the impersonal brahman conception of truth but then they gradually rose to the platform of devotional service one who cannot elevate himself beyond the impersonal conception of brahman runs the risk of falling down in rmadbhgavatam it is stated that although a person may rise to the stage of impersonal brahman without going farther with no information of the supreme person his intelligence is not perfectly clear therefore in spite of being raised to the brahman platform there is the chance of falling down if one is not engaged in the devotional service of the lord in the vedic language it is also said raso vai sa rasa hy evya labdhvnand bhavati when one understands the personality of god the reservoir of pleasure ka he actually becomes transcendentally blissful the supreme lord is full in six opulences and when a devotee approaches him there is an exchange of these six opulences the servant of the king enjoys on an almost equal level with the king and so eternal happiness imperishable happiness eternal life accompany devotional service therefore realization of brahman or eternity or imperishability is included in devotional service this is already possessed by a person who is engaged in devotional service the living entity although brahman by nature has the desire to lord it over the material world and due to this he falls down in his constitutional position a living entity is above the three modes of material nature but association with material nature entangles him in the different modes of material nature goodness passion and ignorance due to the association of these three modes his desire to dominate the material world is there by engagement in devotional service in full ka consciousness he is immediately situated in the transcendental position and his unlawful desire to control material nature is removed therefore the process of devotional service beginning with hearing chanting rememberingthe prescribed nine methods for realizing devotional serviceshould be practiced in the association of devotees gradually by such association by the influence of the spiritual master ones material desire to dominate is removed and one becomes firmly situated in the lords transcendental loving service this method is prescribed from the twentysecond to the last verse of this chapter devotional service to the lord is very simple one should always engage in the service of the lord should eat the remnants of foodstuffs offered to the deity smell the flowers offered to the lotus feet of the lord see the places where the lord had his transcendental pastimes read of the different activities of the lord his reciprocation of love with his devotees chant always the transcendental vibration hare ka hare ka ka ka hare hare hare rma hare rma rma rma hare hare and observe the fasting days commemorating the appearances and disappearances of the lord and his devotees by following such a process one becomes completely detached from all material activities one who can thus situate himself in the brahmajyoti is equal to the supreme personality of godhead in quality thus end the bhaktivedanta purports to the fourteenth chapter of the rmadbhagavadgt in the matter of the three modes of material nature chapter fifteen the yoga of the supreme person text 1 r bhagavn uvca

banyan tree which has its roots upward and its branches down and whose leaves are the vedic hymns one who knows this tree is the knower of the vedas purport after the discussion of the importance of bhaktiyoga one may question what about the vedas it is explained in this chapter that the purpose of vedic study is to understand ka therefore one who is in ka consciousness who is engaged in devotional service already knows the vedas the entanglement of this material world is compared here to a banyan tree for one who is engaged in fruitive activities there is no end to the banyan tree he wanders from one branch to another to another to another the tree of this material world has no end and for one who is attached to this tree there is no possibility of liberation the vedic hymns meant for elevating oneself are called the leaves of this tree this trees roots grow upward because they begin from where brahm is located the topmost planet of this universe if one can understand this indestructible tree of illusion then one can get out of it this process of extrication should be understood in the previous chapters it has been explained that there are many processes by which to get out of the material entanglement and up to the thirteenth chapter we have seen that devotional service to the supreme lord is the best way now the basic principle of devotional service is detachment from material activities and attachment to the transcendental service of the lord the process of breaking attachment to the material world is discussed in the beginning of this chapter the root of this material existence grows upward this means that it begins from the total material substance from the topmost planet of the universe from there the whole universe is expanded with so many branches representing the various planetary systems the fruits represent the results of the living entities activities namely religion economic development sense gratification and liberation now there is no ready experience in this world of a tree situated with its branches down and its roots upward but there is such a thing that tree can be found beside a reservoir of water we can see that the trees on the bank reflect upon the water with their branches down and roots up in other words the tree of this material world is only a reflection of the real tree of the spiritual world this reflection of the spiritual world is situated on desire just as the trees reflection is situated on water desire is the cause of things being situated in this reflected material light one who wants to get out of this material existence must know this tree thoroughly through analytical study then he can cut off his relationship with it this tree being the reflection of the real tree is an exact replica everything is there in the spiritual world the impersonalists take brahm to be the root of this material tree and from the root according to skhya philosophy come prakti purua then the three guas then the five gross elements pacamahbhta then the ten senses daendriya mind etc in this way they divide up the whole material world if brahm is the center of all manifestations then this material world is a manifestation of the center by 180 degrees and the other 180 degrees constitute the spiritual world the material world is the perverted reflection so the spiritual world must have the same variegatedness but in reality the prakti is the external energy of the supreme lord and the purua is the supreme lord himself and that is explained in bhagavadgt since this manifestation is material it is temporary a reflection is temporary for it is sometimes seen and sometimes not seen but the origin from whence the reflection is reflected is eternal the material reflection of the real tree has to be cut off when it is said that a person knows the vedas it is assumed that he knows how to cut off attachment to this material world if one knows that process he actually knows the vedas one who is attracted by the ritualistic formulas of the vedas is attracted by the beautiful green leaves of the tree he does not exactly know the purpose of the vedas the purpose of the vedas as disclosed by the personality of godhead himself is to cut down this reflected tree and attain the real tree of the spiritual world text 2 adha cordhva prasts tasya kh guapravddh viayapravl adha ca mlny anusantatni

material nature the twigs are the objects of the senses this tree also has roots going down and these are bound to the fruitive actions of human society purport the description of the banyan tree is further explained here its branches are spread in all directions in the lower parts there are variegated manifestations of living entities such as human beings animals horses cows dogs cats etc these are situated on the lower parts of the branches whereas on the upper parts are higher forms of living entities the demigods gandharvas fairies and many other higher species of life as a tree is nourished by water so this tree is nourished by the three modes of material nature sometimes we find that a tract of land is barren for want of sufficient water and sometimes a tract is very green similarly where the modes of material nature are proportionately greater in quantity the different species of life are manifested in that proportion the twigs of the tree are considered to be the sense objects by development of the different modes of nature we develop different senses and by the senses we enjoy different varieties of sense objects the source of the sensesthe ears the nose eyes etcis considered to be the upper twigs tuned to the enjoyment of different sense objects the leaves are sound form touchthe sense objects the roots which are subsidiary are the byproducts of different varieties of suffering and sense enjoyment thus we develop attachment and aversion the tendencies toward piety and impiety are considered to be the secondary roots spreading in all directions the real root is from brahmaloka and the other roots are in the human planetary systems after one enjoys the results of virtuous activities in the upper planetary systems he comes down to this earth and renews his karma or fruitive activities for promotion this planet of human beings is considered the field of activities texts 34 na rpam asyeha tathopalabhyate nnto na cdir na ca sampratih avattham ena

in this world no one can understand where it ends where it begins or where its foundation is but with determination one must cut down this tree with the weapon of detachment so doing one must seek that place from which having once gone one never returns and there surrender to that supreme personality of godhead from whom everything has begun and in whom everything is abiding since time immemorial purport it is now clearly stated that the real form of this banyan tree cannot be understood in this material world since the root is upwards the extension of the real tree is at the other end no one can see how far the tree extends nor can one see the beginning of this tree yet one has to find out the cause i am the son of my father my father is the son of such and such a person etc by searching in this way one comes to brahm who is generated by the garbhodakay viu finally in this way when one reaches to the supreme personality of godhead that is the end of research work one has to search out that origin of this tree the supreme personality of godhead through the association of persons who are in the knowledge of that supreme personality of godhead then by understanding one becomes gradually detached from this false reflection of reality and by knowledge one can cut off the connection and actually become situated in the real tree the word asaga is very important in this connection because the attachment for sense enjoyment and lording it over the material nature is very strong therefore one must learn detachment by discussion of spiritual science based on authoritative scriptures and one must hear from persons who are actually in knowledge as a result of such discussion in the association of devotees one comes to the supreme personality of godhead then the first thing one must do is surrender to him the description of that place whence going no one returns to this false reflected tree is given here the supreme personality of godhead ka is the original root from whom everything has emanated to gain favor of that personality of godhead one has only to surrender and this is a result of performing devotional service by hearing chanting etc he is the cause of this extension of this material world this is already explained by the lord himself aha sarvasya prabhava i am the origin of everything therefore to get out of the entanglement of this strong banyan tree of material life one must surrender to ka as soon as one surrenders unto ka he becomes detached automatically from this material extension text 5 nirmnamoh jitasagado adhytmanity

is free from illusion false prestige and false association who understands the eternal who is done with material lust and is freed from the duality of happiness and distress and who knows how to surrender unto the supreme person attains to that eternal kingdom purport the surrendering process is described here very nicely the first qualification is that one should not be deluded by pride because the conditioned soul is puffed up thinking himself the lord of material nature it is very difficult for him to surrender unto the supreme personality of godhead one should know by the cultivation of real knowledge that he is not lord of material nature the supreme personality of godhead is the lord when one is free from delusion caused by pride he can begin the process of surrender for one who is always expecting some honor in this material world it is not possible to surrender to the supreme person pride is due to illusion for although one comes here stays for a brief time and then goes away he has the foolish notion that he is the lord of the world he thus makes all things complicated and he is always in trouble the whole world moves under this impression people are considering that the land this earth belongs to human society and they have divided the land under the false impression that they are the proprietors one has to get out of this false notion that human society is the proprietor of this world when one is freed from such a false notion he becomes free from all the false associations caused by familial social and national affections these fake associations bind one to this material world after this stage one has to develop spiritual knowledge one has to cultivate knowledge of what is actually his own and what is actually not his own and when one has an understanding of things as they are he becomes free from all dual conceptions such as happiness and distress pleasure and pain he becomes full in knowledge then it is possible for him to surrender to the supreme personality of godhead text 6 na tad bhsayate sryo na ako na pvaka yad gatv na nivartante tad dhma parama mama nanot tatthat bhsayateilluminates sryasun nanor akathe moon nanor pvakafire electricity yatwhere gatvgoing nanever nivartantecomes back tat dhmathat abode paramamsupreme mamamy translation that abode of mine is not illumined by the sun or moon nor by electricity one who reaches it never returns to this material world purport the spiritual world the abode of the supreme personality of godhead kawhich is known as kaloka goloka vndvanais described here in the spiritual sky there is no need of sunshine moonshine fire or electricity because all the planets are selfluminous we have only one planet in this universe the sun which is selfluminous but all the planets in the spiritual sky are selfluminous the shining effulgence of all those planets called vaikuhas constitutes the shining sky known as the brahmajyoti actually the effulgence is emanating from the planet of ka goloka vndvana part of that shining effulgence is covered by the mahattattva the material world other than this the major portion of that shining sky is full of spiritual planets which are called vaikuhas chief of which is goloka vndvana as long as a living entity is in this dark material world he is in conditional life but as soon as he reaches the spiritual sky by cutting through the false perverted tree of this material world he becomes liberated then there is no chance of his coming back here in his conditional life the living entity considers himself to be the lord of this material world but in his liberated state he enters into the spiritual kingdom and becomes the associate of the supreme lord there he enjoys eternal bliss eternal life and full knowledge one should be captivated by this information he should desire to transfer himself to that eternal world and extricate himself from this false reflection of reality for one who is too much attached to this material world it is very difficult to cut that attachment but if he takes to ka consciousness there is a chance of gradually becoming detached one has to associate himself with devotees those who are in ka consciousness one should search out a society dedicated to ka consciousness and learn how to discharge devotional service in this way he can cut off his attachment to the material world one cannot become detached from the attraction of the material world simply by dressing himself in saffron cloth he must become attached to the devotional service of the lord therefore one should take it very seriously that devotional service as described in the twelfth chapter is the only way to get out of this false representation of the real tree in chapter fourteen the contamination of all kinds of processes by material nature is described only devotional service is described as purely transcendental the words parama mama are very important here actually every nook and corner is the property of the supreme lord but the spiritual world is paramam full of six opulences in the upaniads it is also confirmed that in the spiritual world there is no need of sunshine or moonshine for the whole spiritual sky is illuminated by the internal potency of the supreme lord that supreme abode can be achieved only by surrender and by no other means text 7 mamaivo jvaloke

indriyisenses prakti material nature sthnisituated karatistruggling hard translation the living entities in this conditioned world are my eternal fragmental parts due to conditioned life they are struggling very hard with the six senses which include the mind purport in this verse the identity of the living being is clearly given the living entity is the fragmental part and parcel of the supreme lordeternally it is not that he assumes individuality in his conditional life and in his liberated state becomes one with the supreme lord he is eternally fragmented it is clearly said santana according to the vedic version the supreme lord manifests and expands himself in innumerable expansions of which the primary expansions are called viutattva and the secondary expansions are called the living entities in other words the viutattva is the personal expansion and the living entities are separated expansions by his personal expansion he is manifested in various forms like lord rma nsihadeva viumrti and all the predominating deities in the vaikuha planets the separated expansions the living entities are eternally servitors the personal expansions of the supreme personality of godhead the individual identities of the godhead are always present similarly the separated expansions of living entities have their identities as fragmental parts and parcels of the supreme lord the living entities have also fragmental qualities of which independence is one every living entity has an individual soul his personal individuality and a minute form of independence by misuse of that independence one becomes a conditioned soul and by proper use of independence he is always liberated in either case he is qualititatively eternal as the supreme lord is in his liberated state he is freed from this material condition and he is under the engagement of transcendental service unto the lord in his conditioned life he is dominated by the material modes of nature and he forgets the transcendental loving service of the lord as a result he has to struggle very hard to maintain his existence in the material world the living entities not only the human beings and the cats and dogs but even the greater controllers of the material worldbrahm lord iva and even viuare all parts and parcels of the supreme lord they are all eternal not temporary manifestations the word karati struggling or grappling hard is very significant the conditioned soul is bound up as though shackled by iron chains he is bound up by the false ego and the mind is the chief agent which is driving him in this material existence when the mind is in the mode of goodness his activities are good when the mind is in the mode of passion his activities are troublesome and when the mind is in the mode of ignorance he travels in the lower species of life it is clear however in this verse that the conditioned soul is covered by the material body with the mind and the senses and when he is liberated this material covering perishes but his spiritual body manifests in its individual capacity the following information is there in the mdhyandinyanaruti sa v ea brahmaniha ida arra marttyam atisjya brahmbhisampadya brahma payati brahma oti brahmaaiveda sarvam anubhavati it is stated here that when a living entity gives up this material embodiment and enters into the spiritual world he revives his spiritual body and in his spiritual body he can see the supreme personality of godhead face to face he can hear and speak to him face to face and he can understand the supreme personality as he is in smti also it is understood that in the spiritual planets everyone lives in bodies featured like the supreme personality of godheads as far as bodily construction is concerned there is no difference between the part and parcel living entities and the expansions of viumrti in other words at liberation the living entity gets a spiritual body by the grace of the supreme personality of godhead the word mamaiva fragmental parts and parcels of the supreme lord is also very significant the fragmental portion of the supreme lord is not like some material broken part we have already understood in the second chapter that the spirit cannot be cut into pieces this fragment is not materially conceived it is not like matter which can be cut into pieces and joined together again that conception is not applicable here because the sanskrit word santana eternal is used the fragmental portion is eternal it is also stated in the beginning of the second chapter that dehinosmin yath in each and every individual body the fragmental portion of the supreme lord is present that fragmental portion when liberated from the bodily entanglement revives its original spiritual body in the spiritual sky in a spiritual planet and enjoys association with the supreme lord it is however understood here that the living entity being the fragmental part and parcel of the supreme lord is qualitatively one just as the parts and parcels of gold are also gold text 8 arra yad avpnoti yac cpy utkrmatvara ghtvaitni sayti vyur gandhn ivayt arrambody yatas much as avpnotigets yatthat which ca also apivirtually utkrmatigives up varathe lord of the body ghtvtaking etniall these saytigoes away vyuair gandhn smell ivalike aytfrom the flower translation the living entity in the material world carries his different conceptions of life from one body to another as the air carries aromas purport here the living entity is described as vara the controller of his own body if he likes he can change his body to a higher grade and if he likes he can move to a lower class minute independence is there the change his body undergoes depends upon him at the time of death the consciousness he has created will carry him on to the next type of body if he has made his consciousness like that of a cat or dog he is sure to change to a cats or dogs body and if he has fixed his consciousness on godly qualities he will change into the form of a demigod and if he is in ka consciousness he will be transferred to kaloka in the spiritual world and will associate with ka it is a false claim that after the annihilation of this body everything is finished the individual soul is transmigrating from one body to another and his present body and present activities are the background of his next body one gets a different body according to karma and he has to quit this body in due course it is stated here that the subtle body which carries the conception of the next body develops another body in the next life this process of transmigrating from one body to another and struggling while in the body is called karati or struggle for existence text 9 rotra caku sparana ca rasana ghram eva ca adhihya mana

translation the living entity thus taking another gross body obtains a certain type of ear tongue and nose and sense of touch which are grouped about the mind he thus enjoys a particular set of sense objects purport in other words if the living entity adulterates his consciousness with the qualities of cats and dogs in his next life he gets a cat or dog body and enjoys consciousness is originally pure like water but if we mix water with a certain color it changes similarly consciousness is pure for the spirit soul is pure but consciousness is changed according to the association of the material qualities real consciousness is ka consciousness when therefore one is situated in ka consciousness he is in his pure life but if his consciousness is adulterated by some type of material mentality in the next life he gets a corresponding body he does not necessarily get a human body again he can get the body of a cat dog hog demigod or one of many other forms for there are 8400000 species text 10 utkrmanta sthita vpi bhujna v gunvitam vimh nnupayanti payanti jnacakua utkrmantamquitting the body sthitamsituated in the body vpi either bhujnamenjoying vor guaanvitamunder the spell

can quit his body nor can they understand what sort of body he enjoys under the spell of the modes of nature but one whose eyes are trained in knowledge can see all this purport the word jnacakua is very significant without knowledge one cannot understand how a living entity leaves his present body nor what form of body he is going to take in the next life nor even why he is living in a particular type of body this requires a great amount of knowledge understood from bhagavadgt and similar literatures heard from a bona fide spiritual master one who is trained to perceive all these things is fortunate every living entity is quitting his body under certain circumstanceshe is living under certain circumstances and enjoying under certain circumstances under the spell of material nature as a result he is suffering different kinds of happiness and distress under the illusion of sense enjoyment persons who are everlastingly fooled by lust and desire lose all power of understanding their change of body and their stay in a particular body they cannot comprehend it those who have developed spiritual knowledge however can see that the spirit is different from the body and is changing its body and enjoying in different ways a person in such knowledge can understand how the conditioned living entity is suffering in this material existence therefore those who are highly developed in ka consciousness try their best to give this knowledge to the people in general for their conditional life is very much troublesome they should come out of it and be ka conscious and liberate themselves to transfer to the spiritual world text 11 yatanto yogina caina payanty tmany avasthitam yatanto py akttmno naina payanty acetasa yatantaendeavoring yoginatranscendentalists

translation the endeavoring transcendentalist who is situated in selfrealization can see all this clearly but those who are not situated in selfrealization cannot see what is taking place though they may try to purport there are many transcendentalists in the path of spiritual selfrealization but one who is not situated in selfrealization cannot see how things are changing in the body of the living entity the word yogina is significant in this connection in the present day there are many socalled yogs and there are many socalled associations of yogs but they are actually blind in the matter of selfrealization they are simply addicted to some sort of gymnastic exercise and are satisfied if the body is wellbuilt and healthy they have no other information they are called yatantopy akttmna even though they are endeavoring in a socalled yoga system they are not selfrealized such people cannot understand the process of the transmigration of the soul only those who are actually in the yoga system and have realized the self the world and the supreme lord in other words the bhaktiyogs those engaged in pure devotional service in krsa consciousness can understand how things are taking place text 12 yad dityagata tejo jagad bhsayate khilam yac candramasi yac cgnau tat tejo viddhi mmakam yatthat which dityagatamin the sunshine tejasplendor jagat the whole world

which dissipates the darkness of this whole world comes from me and the splendor of the moon and the splendor of fire are also from me purport the unintelligent cannot understand how things are taking place the beginning of knowledge can be established by understanding what the lord explains here everyone sees the sun moon fire and electricity one should simply try to understand that the splendor of the sun the splendor of the moon and the splendor of electricity or fire are coming from the supreme personality of godhead in such a conception of life the beginning of ka consciousness lies a great deal of advancement for the conditioned soul in this material world the living entities are essentially the parts and parcels of the supreme lord and he is giving herewith the hint how they can come back to godhead back to home from this verse we can understand that the sun is illuminating the whole solar system there are different universes and solar systems and there are different suns moons and planets also sunlight is due to the spiritual effulgence in the spiritual sky of the supreme lord with the rise of the sun the activities of human beings are set up they set fire to prepare their foodstuff they set fire to start the factories etc so many things are done with the help of fire therefore sunrise fire and moonlight are so pleasing to the living entities without their help no living entity can live so if one can understand that the light and splendor of the sun moon and fire are emanating from the supreme personality of godhead ka then ones ka consciousness will begin by the moonshine all the vegetables are nourished the moonshine is so pleasing that people can easily understand that they are living by the mercy of the supreme personality of godhead ka without his mercy there cannot be sun without his mercy there cannot be moon and without his mercy there cannot be fire and without the help of sun moon and fire no one can live these are some thoughts to provoke ka consciousness in the conditioned soul text 13 gm viya ca bhtni dhraymy aham ojas pumi cauadh sarv somo bhtv rastmaka gmthe planets viyaentering caalso bhtniliving entities dhraymisustaining ahami

become the moon and thereby supply the juice of life to all vegetables purport it is understood that all the planets are floating in the air only by the energy of the lord the lord enters into every atom every planet and every living being that is discussed in the brahmasahit it is said there that one plenary portion of the supreme personality of godhead paramtm enters into the planets the universe the living entity and even into the atom so due to his entrance everything is appropriately manifested when the spirit soul is there a living man can float on the water but when the living spark is out of the body and the body is dead it sinks of course when it is decomposed it floats just like straw and other things but as soon as the man is dead he at once sinks in the water similarly all these planets are floating in space and this is due to the entrance of the supreme energy of the supreme personality of godhead his energy is sustaining each planet just like a handful of dust if someone holds a handful of dust there is no possibility of the dust falling but if one throws it in the air it will fall down similarly these planets which are floating in air are actually held in the fist of the universal form of the supreme lord by his strength and energy all moving and unmoving things stay in their place it is said that because of the supreme personality of godhead the sun is shining and the planets are steadily moving were it not for him all the planets would scatter like dust in air and perish similarly it is due to the supreme personality of godhead that the moon nourishes all vegetables due to the moons influence the vegetables become delicious without the moonshine the vegetables can neither grow nor taste succulent human society is working living comfortably and enjoying food due to the supply from the supreme lord otherwise mankind could not survive the word rastmaka is very significant everything becomes palatable by the agency of the supreme lord through the influence of the moon text 14 aha vaivnaro bhtv prin deham rita prpnasamyukta pacmy anna caturvidham ahami vaivnaraby my plenary portion as the digesting fire bhtvbecoming

in every living body and i am the air of life outgoing and incoming by which i digest the four kinds of foodstuff purport according to yurvedic stra we understand that there is a fire in the stomach which digests all food sent there when the fire is not blazing there is no hunger and when the fire is in order we become hungry sometimes when the fire is not going nicely treatment is required in any case this fire is representative of the supreme personality of godhead vedic mantras also confirm that the supreme lord or brahman is situated in the form of fire within the stomach and is digesting all kinds of foodstuff therefore since he is helping the digestion of all kinds of foodstuff the living entity is not independent in the eating process unless the supreme lord helps him in digesting there is no possibility of eating he thus produces and digests foodstuff and by his grace we are enjoying life in the vedntastra this is also confirmed abddibhyonta pratihnc ca the lord is situated within sound and within the body within the air and even within the stomach as the digestive force there are four kinds of foodstuff some are swallowed some are chewed some are licked up and some are sucked and he is the digestive force for all of them text 15 sarvasya cha hdi sannivio matta smtir jnam apohana ca vedai ca sarvair aham eva vedyo vedntakd vedavid eva cham sarvasyaof all

by all the vedas am i to be known indeed i am the compiler of vednta and i am the knower of the vedas purport the supreme lord is situated as paramtm in everyones heart and it is from him that all activities are initiated the living entity forgets everything of his past life but he has to act according to the direction of the supreme lord who is witness to all his work therefore he begins his work according to his past deeds required knowledge is supplied to him and remembrance is given to him and he forgets also about his past life thus the lord is not only allpervading he is also localized in every individual heart he awards the different fruitive results he is not only worshipable as the impersonal brahman the supreme personality of godhead and the localized paramtm but as the form of the incarnation of the vedas as well the vedas give the right direction to the people so that they can properly mold their lives and come back to godhead back to home the vedas offer knowledge of the supreme personality of godhead ka and ka in his incarnation as vysadeva is the compiler of the vedntastra the commentation on the vedntastra by vysadeva in the rmadbhgavatam gives the real understanding of vedntastra the supreme lord is so full that for the deliverance of the conditioned soul he is the supplier and digester of foodstuff the witness of his activity the giver of knowledge in the form of vedas and as the supreme personality of godhead r ka the teacher of the bhagavadgt he is worshipable by the conditioned soul thus god is allgood god is allmerciful antapravia st jannm the living entity forgets as soon as he quits his present body but he begins his work again initiated by the supreme lord although he forgets the lord gives him the intelligence to renew his work where he ended his last life so not only does a living entity enjoy or suffer in this world according to the dictation from the supreme lord situated locally in the heart but he receives the opportunity to understand vedas from him if one is serious to understand the vedic knowledge then ka gives the required intelligence why does he present the vedic knowledge for understanding because a living entity individually needs to understand ka vedic literature confirms this yo sau sarvair vedair gyate in all vedic literature beginning from the four vedas vedntastra and the upaniads and puras the glories of the supreme lord are celebrated by performing vedic rituals discussing the vedic philosophy and worshiping the lord in devotional service he is attained therefore the purpose of the vedas is to understand ka the vedas give us direction to understand ka and the process of understanding the ultimate goal is the supreme personality of godhead vedntastra confirms this in the following words tat tu samanvayt one can attain perfection by understanding vedic literature and one can understand his relationship with the supreme personality of godhead by performing the different processes thus one can approach him and at the end attain the supreme goal who is no other than the supreme personality of godhead in this verse however the purpose of the vedas the understanding of the vedas and the goal of vedas are clearly defined text 16 dvv imau puruau loke kara ckara eva ca kara sarvi bhtni kastho kara ucyate dvautwo imauin this world puruauliving entities lokein the world

fallible and the infallible in the material world every entity is fallible and in the spiritual world every entity is called infallible purport as already explained the lord in his incarnation as vysadeva compiled the vedntastra here the lord is giving in summary the contents of the vedntastra he says that the living entities who are innumerable can be divided into two classesthe fallible and the infallible the living entities are eternally separated parts and parcels of the supreme personality of godhead when they are in contact with the material world they are called jvabht and the sanskrit words given here sarvi bhtni mean that they are fallible those who are in oneness with the supreme personality of godhead however are called infallible oneness does not mean that they have no individuality but that there is no disunity they are all agreeable to the purpose of the creation of course in the spiritual world there is no such thing as creation but since the supreme personality of godhead has stated in the vedntastra that he is the source of all emanations that conception is explained according to the statement of the supreme personality of godhead lord ka there are two classes of men the vedas give evidence of this so there is no doubt about it the living entities who are struggling in this world with the mind and five senses have their material bodies which are changing as long as the living entities are conditioned ones body changes due to contact with matter matter is changing so the living entity appears to be changing but in the spiritual world the body is not made of matter therefore there is no change in the material world the living entity undergoes six changesbirth growth duration reproduction then dwindling and vanishing these are the changes of the material body but in the spiritual world the body does not change there is no old age there is no birth there is no death there all exists in oneness it is more clearly explained as sarvi bhtni any living entity who has come in contact with matter beginning from the first created being brahm down to a small ant is changing its body therefore they are all fallible in the spiritual world however they are always liberated in oneness text 17 uttama puruas tv anya paramtmety udhta yo lokatrayam viya bibharty avyaya vara uttamathe best puruapersonality tubut anyaanother param the supreme

living personality the lord himself who has entered into these worlds and is maintaining them purport this verse is very nicely expressed in the kaha upaniad and vetvatara upaniad it is clearly stated there that above the innumerable living entities some of whom are conditioned and some of whom are liberated there is the supreme personality who is paramtm the upanisadic verse runs as follows nityo nityn cetana cetannm the purport is that amongst all the living entities both conditioned and liberated there is one supreme living personality the supreme personality of godhead who maintains them and gives them all the facility of enjoyment according to different work that supreme personality of godhead is situated in everyones heart as paramtm a wise man who can understand him is eligible to attain the perfect peace not others it is incorrect to think of the supreme lord and the living entities as being on the same level or equal in all respects there is always the question of superiority and inferiority in their personalities this particular word uttama is very significant no one can surpass the supreme personality of godhead loke is also significant because in the paurua a vedic literature it is stated lokyate vedrthonena this supreme lord in his localized aspect as paramtm explains the purpose of the vedas the following verse also appears in the vedas tvad ea samprasdo smc charrt samutthya para jyotirpa sampadya svena rpebhinipadyate sa uttama purua the supersoul coming out of the body enters the impersonal brahmajyoti then in his form he remains in his spiritual identity that supreme is called the supreme personality this means that the supreme personality is exhibiting and diffusing his spiritual effulgence which is the ultimate illumination that supreme personality also has a localized aspect as paramtm by incarnating himself as the son of satyavat and parara he explains the vedic knowledge as vysadeva text 18 pictures part 3 yasmt karam atto ham

because i am the greatest i am celebrated both in the world and in the vedas as that supreme person purport no one can surpass the supreme personality of godhead kaneither the conditioned soul nor the liberated soul he is therefore the greatest of personalities now it is clear here that the living entities and the supreme personality of godhead are individuals the difference is that the living entities either in the conditioned state or in the liberated state cannot surpass in quantity the inconceivable potencies of the supreme personality of godhead text 19 yo mm evam asammho jnti

as the knower of everything and he therefore engages himself in full devotional service o son of bharata purport there are many philosophical speculations about the constitutional position of the living entities and the supreme absolute truth now in this verse the supreme personality of godhead clearly explains that anyone who knows lord ka as the supreme person is actually the knower of everything the imperfect knower goes on simply speculating about the absolute truth but the perfect knower without wasting his valuable time engages directly in ka consciousness the devotional service of the supreme lord throughout the whole of bhagavadgt this fact is being stressed at every step and still there are so many stubborn commentators on bhagavadgt who consider the supreme absolute truth and the living entities to be one and the same vedic knowledge is called ruti learning by aural reception one should actually receive the vedic message from authorities like ka and his representatives here ka distinguishes everything very nicely and one should hear from this source simply to hear like the hogs is not sufficient one must be able to understand from the authorities it is not that one should simply speculate academically one should submissively hear from bhagavadgt that these living entities are always subordinate to the supreme personality of godhead anyone who is able to understand this according to the supreme personality of godhead r ka knows the purpose of the vedas no one else knows the purpose of the vedas the word bhajate is very significant in many places the word bhajate is expressed in relationship with the service of the supreme lord if a person is engaged in full ka consciousness in devotional service of the lord it is to be understood that he has understood all the vedic knowledge in the vaiava parampar it is said that if one is engaged in the devotional service of ka then there is no need for a spiritual process to understand the supreme absolute truth he has already come to the post because he is engaged in the devotional service of the lord he has ended all preliminary processes of understanding similarly if anyone after speculating for hundreds of thousands of lives does not come to the point that ka is the supreme personality of godhead and that one has to surrender there all his speculation for so many years and lives is a useless waste of time text 20 iti guhyatama stram idam ukta maynagha etad buddhv buddhimn syt ktaktya ca bhrata itithus guhyatamamthe most confidential stramrevealed scriptures idamthis uktamdisclosed

vedic scriptures o sinless one and it is disclosed now by me whoever understands this will become wise and his endeavors will know perfection purport the lord clearly explains here that this is the substance of all revealed scriptures and one should understand this as it is given by the supreme personality of godhead thus one will become intelligent and perfect in transcendental knowledge in other words by understanding this philosophy of the supreme personality of godhead and engaging in his transcendental service everyone can become freed from all contaminations of the modes of material nature devotional service is a process of spiritual understanding wherever devotional service exists the material contamination cannot coexist devotional service to the lord and the lord himself are one and the same because they are spiritualthe internal energy of the supreme lord the lord is said to be the sun and ignorance is called darkness where the sun is present there is no question of darkness therefore whenever devotional service is present under the proper guidance of a bona fide spiritual master there is no question of ignorance everyone must take to this consciousness of ka and engage in devotional service to become intelligent and purified unless one comes to this position of understanding ka and engages in devotional service however intelligent he may be in the estimation of some common man he is not perfectly intelligent the word anagha by which arjuna is addressed is significant anagha o sinless one means that unless one is free from all sinful reactions it is very difficult to understand ka one has to become free from all contamination all sinful activities then he can understand but devotional service is so pure and potent that once one is engaged in devotional service he automatically comes to the stage of sinlessness while performing devotional service in the association of pure devotees in full ka consciousness there are certain things which require to be vanquished altogether the most important thing one has to surmount is weakness of the heart the first falldown is caused by the desire to lord it over material nature thus one gives up the transcendental loving service of the supreme lord the second weakness of the heart is that as one increases the propensity of lording it over material nature he becomes attached to matter and the possession of matter the problems of material existence are due to these weaknesses of the heart thus end the bhaktivedanta purports to the fifteenth chapter of the rmadbhagavadgt in the matter of

cleanliness freedom from envy and the passion for honorthese transcendental qualities o son of bharata belong to godly men endowed with divine nature purport in the beginning of the fifteenth chapter the banyan tree of this material world was explained the extra roots coming out of it were compared to the activities of the living entities some auspicious some inauspicious in the ninth chapter also the devas or godly and the asuras the ungodly or demons were explained now according to vedic rites activities in the mode of goodness are considered auspicious for progress on the path of liberation and such activities are known as devaprakti transcendental by nature those who are situated in the transcendental nature make progress on the path of liberation for those who are acting in the modes of passion and ignorance on the other hand there is no possibility of liberation either they will have to remain in this material world as human beings or they will descend among the species of animals or even lower life forms in this sixteenth chapter the lord explains both the transcendental nature and its attendant qualities as well as the demoniac nature and its qualities he also explains the advantages and disadvantages of these qualities the word abhijtasya in reference to one born of transcendental qualities or godly tendencies is very significant to beget a child in a godly atmosphere is known in the vedic scriptures as garbhdhna saskra if the parents want a child in the godly qualities they should follow the ten principles of the human being in bhagavadgt we have studied also before that sex life for begetting a good child is ka himself sex life is not condemned provided the process is used in ka consciousness those who are in ka consciousness at least should not beget children like cats and dogs but should beget them so they may become ka conscious after birth that should be the advantage of children born of a father or mother absorbed in ka consciousness the social institution known as varramadharmathe institution dividing society into four divisions or castesis not meant to divide human society according to birth such divisions are in terms of educational qualifications they are to keep the society in a state of peace and prosperity the qualities mentioned herein are explained as transcendental qualities meant for making a person progress in spiritual understanding so he can get liberated from the material world in the varrama institution the sannys or the person in the renounced order of life is considered to be the head or the spiritual master of all the social statuses and orders a brhmaa is considered to be the spiritual master of the three other sections of a society namely the katriyas the vaiyas and the dras but a sannys who is on the top of the institution is considered to be the spiritual master of the brhmaas also for a sannys the first qualification should be fearlessness because a sannys has to be alone without any support or guarantee of support he has simply to depend on the mercy of the supreme personality of godhead if he thinks after leaving my connections who will protect me he should not accept the renounced order of life one must be fully convinced that ka or the supreme personality of godhead in his localized aspect as paramtm is always within that he is seeing everything and he always knows what one intends to do one must thus have firm conviction that ka as paramtm will take care of a soul surrendered to him i shall never be alone one should think even if i live in the darkest regions of a forest i shall be accompanied by ka and he will give me all protection that conviction is called abhayam without fear this state of mind is necessary for a person in the renounced order of life then he has to purify his existence there are so many rules and regulations to be followed in the renounced order of life most important of all a sannys is strictly forbidden to have any intimate relationship with a woman he is even forbidden to talk with a woman in a secluded place lord caitanya was an ideal sannys and when he was at pur his feminine devotees could not even come near to offer their respects they were advised to bow down from a distant place this is not a sign of hatred for women as a class but it is a stricture imposed on the sannys not to have close connections with women one has to follow the rules and regulations of a particular status of life in order to purify his existence for a sannys intimate relations with women and possessions of wealth for sense gratification are strictly forbidden the ideal sannys was lord caitanya himself and we can learn from his life that he was very strict in regards to women although he is considered to be the most liberal incarnation of godhead accepting the most fallen conditioned souls he strictly followed the rules and regulations of the sannysa order of the life in connection with association with woman one of his personal associates namely choa haridsa was personally associated with lord caitanya along with his other confidential personal associates but somehow or other this choa haridsa looked lustily on a young woman and lord caitanya was so strict that he at once rejected him from the society of his personal associates lord caitanya said for a sannys or anyone who is aspiring to get out of the clutches of material nature and trying to elevate himself to the spiritual nature and go back to home back to godhead for him looking toward material possessions and women for sense gratificationnot even enjoying them but just looking toward them with such a propensityis so condemned that he had better commit suicide before experiencing such illicit desires so these are the processes for purification the next item is jnayogavyavasthiti being engaged in the cultivation of knowledge sannys life is meant for distributing knowledge to the householders and others who have forgotten their real life of spiritual advancement a sannys is supposed to beg from door to door for his livelihood but this does not mean that he is a beggar humility is also one of the qualifications of a transcendentally situated person and out of sheer humility the sannys goes from door to door not exactly for the purpose of begging but to see the householders and awaken them to ka consciousness this is the duty of a sannys if he is actually advanced and so ordered by his spiritual master he should preach ka consciousness with logic and understanding and if he is not so advanced he should not accept the renounced order of life but even if he has accepted the renounced order of life without sufficient knowledge he should engage himself fully in hearing from a bona fide spiritual master to cultivate knowledge a sannys or one in the renounced order of life must be situated in fearlessness sattvasauddhi purity and jnayoga knowledge the next item is charity charity is meant for the householders the householders should earn a livelihood by an honorable means and spend fifty percent of their income to propagate ka consciousness all over the world thus a householder should give in charity to such institutional societies that are engaged in that way charity should be given to the right receiver there are different kinds of charities as will be explained later on charity in the modes of goodness passion and ignorance charity in the mode of goodness is recommended by the scriptures but charity in the modes of passion and ignorance is not recommended because it is simply a waste of money charity should be given only to propagate ka consciousness all over the world that is charity in the mode of goodness then as far as dama selfcontrol is concerned it is not only meant for other orders of religious society but it is especially meant for the householder although he has a wife a householder should not use his senses for sex life unnecessarily there are restrictions for the householders even in sex life which should only be engaged in for the propagation of children if he does not require children he should not enjoy sex life with his wife modern society enjoys sex life with contraceptive methods or more abominable methods to avoid the responsibility of children this is not in the transcendental quality but is demoniac if anyone even if he is a householder wants to make progress in spiritual life he must control his sex life and should not beget a child without the purpose of serving ka if he is able to beget children who will be in ka consciousness one can produce hundreds of children but without this capacity one should not indulge only for sense pleasure sacrifice is another item to be performed by the householders because sacrifices require a large amount of money other orders of life namely the brahmacarya the vnaprastha and sannysa have no money they live by begging so performance of different types of sacrifice is meant for the householder they should perform agnihotra sacrifices as enjoined in the vedic literature but such sacrifices at the present moment are very expensive and it is not possible for any householder to perform them the best sacrifice recommended in this age is called sakrtanayaja the chanting of hare ka hare ka ka ka hare harehare rma hare rma rma rma hare hare this is the best and most inexpensive sacrifice everyone can adopt it and derive benefit so these three items namely charity sense control and performance of sacrifice are meant for the householder then svdhyya vedic study and tapas austerity and rjavam gentleness or simplicity are meant for the brahmacarya or student life brahmacrs should have no connection with women they should live a life of celibacy and engage the mind in the study of vedic literature for cultivation of spiritual knowledge this is called svdhyya tapas or austerity is especially meant for the retired life one should not remain a householder throughout his whole life he must always remember that there are four divisions of life brahmacarya ghastha vnaprastha and sannysa so after ghastha householder life one should retire if one lives for a hundred years he should spend twentyfive years in student life twentyfive in householder life twentyfive in retired life and twentyfive in the renounced order of life these are the regulations of the vedic religious discipline a man retired from household life must practice austerities of the body mind and tongue that is tapasy the entire varramadharma society is meant for tapasy without tapasy or austerity no human being can get liberation the theory that there is no need of austerity in life that one can go on speculating and everything will be nice is neither recommended in the vedic literature nor in bhagavadgt such theories are manufactured by showbottle spiritualists who are trying to gather more followers if there are restrictions rules and regulations people will not become attracted therefore those who want followers in the name of religion just to have a show only dont restrict the lives of their students nor their own lives but that method is not approved by the vedas as far as simplicity is concerned not only should a particular order of life follow this principle but every member be he in the brahmacaryarama or ghastharama or vnaprastharama one must live very simply ahis means not arresting the progressive life of any living entity one should not think that since the spirit spark is never killed even after the killing of the body there is no harm in killing animals for sense gratification people are now addicted to eating animals in spite of having an ample supply of grains fruits and milk there is no necessity for animal killing this injunction is for everyone when there is no other alternative one may kill an animal but it should be offered in sacrifice at any rate when there is an ample food supply for humanity persons who are desiring to make advancement in spiritual realization should not commit violence to animals real ahis means not checking anyones progressive life the animals are also making progress in their evolutionary life by transmigrating from one category of animal life to another if a particular animal is killed then his progress is checked if an animal is staying in a particular body for so many days or so many years and is untimely killed then he has to come back again in that form of life to complete the remaining days in order to be promoted to another species of life so their progress should not be checked simply to satisfy ones palate this is called ahis satyam this word means that one should not distort the truth for some personal interest in vedic literature there are some difficult passages but the meaning or the purpose should be learned from a bona fide spiritual master that is the process for understanding vedas ruti means that one should hear from the authority one should not construe some interpretation for his personal interest there are so many commentaries on bhagavadgt that misinterpret the original text the real import of the word should be presented and that should be learned from a bona fide spiritual master akrodha means to check anger even if there is provocation one should be tolerant for once one becomes angry his whole body becomes polluted anger is the product of the modes of passion and lust so one who is transcendentally situated should check himself from anger apaiunam means that one should not find fault with others or correct them unnecessarily of course to call a thief a thief is not faultfinding but to call an honest person a thief is very much offensive for one who is making advancement in spiritual life hr means that one should be very modest and must not perform some act which is abominable acpalam determination means that one should not be agitated or frustrated in some attempt there may be failure in some attempt but one should not be sorry for that he should make progress with patience and determination the word teja used here is meant for the katriyas the katriyas should always be very strong to be able to give protection to the weak they should not pose themselves as nonviolent if violence is required they must exhibit it aucam means cleanliness not only in mind and body but in ones dealings also it is especially meant for the mercantile people who should not deal in the black market ntimnit not expecting honor applies to the dras the worker class which are considered according to vedic injunctions to be the lowest of the four classes they should not be puffed up with unnecessary prestige or honor and should remain in their own status it is the duty of the dras to offer respect to the higher class for the upkeep of the social order all these sixteen qualifications mentioned are transcendental qualities they should be cultivated according to the different statuses of the social order the purport is that even though material conditions are miserable if these qualities are developed by practice by all classes of men then gradually it is possible to rise to the highest platform of transcendental realization text 4

purport in this verse the royal road to hell is described the demoniac want to make a show of religion and advancement in spiritual science although they do not follow the principles they are always arrogant or proud in possessing some type of education or so much wealth they desire to be worshiped by others and demand respectability although they do not command respect over trifles they become very angry and speak harshly not gently they do not know what should be done and what should not be done they do everything whimsically according to their own desire and they do not recognize any authority these demoniac qualities are taken on by them from the beginning of their bodies in the wombs of their mothers and as they grow they manifest all these inauspicious qualities text 5 daiv

was not demoniac because he was considering the pros and cons he was considering whether respectable persons such as bhma and droa should be killed or not so he was not acting under the influence of anger false prestige or harshness therefore he was not of the quality of the demons for a katriya a military man shooting arrows at the enemy is considered transcendental and refraining from such a duty is demoniac therefore there was no cause for arjuna to lament anyone who performs the regulated principles of the different orders of life is transcendentally situated text 6 dvau bhtasargau loke

have already explained to you at length the divine qualities now hear from me of the demoniac purport lord ka having assured arjuna that he was born with the divine qualities is now describing the demoniac way the conditioned living entities are divided into two classes in this world those who are born with divine qualities follow a regulated life that is to say they abide by the injunctions in scriptures and by the authorities one should perform duties in the light of authoritative scripture this mentality is called divine one who does not follow the regulative principles as they are laid down in the scriptures and who acts according to his whims is called demoniac or asuric there is no other criterion but obedience to the regulative principles of scriptures it is mentioned in vedic literature that both the demigods and the demons are born of the prajpati the only difference is that one class obeys the vedic injunctions and the other does not text 7 pravtti ca nivtti ca jan na

caand cra behavior nanever satyamtruth teuin them vidyatethere is translation those who are demoniac do not know what is to be done and what is not to be done neither cleanliness nor proper behavior nor truth is found in them purport in every civilized human society there is some set of scriptural rules and regulations which are followed from the beginning especially among the ryans those who adopt the vedic civilization and who are known as the most advanced civilized peoples those who do not follow the scriptural injunctions are supposed to be demons therefore it is stated here that the demons do not know the scriptural rules nor do they have any inclination to follow them most of them do not know them and even if some of them know they have not the tendency to follow them they have no faith nor are they willing to act in terms of the vedic injunctions the demons are not clean either externally or internally one should always be careful to keep his body clean by bathing brushing teeth changing clothes etc as far as internal cleanliness is concerned one should always remember the holy names of god and chant hare ka hare ka ka ka hare harehare rma hare rma rma rma hare hare the demons neither like nor follow all these rules for external and internal cleanliness as for behavior there are many rules and regulations guiding human behavior such as the manusahit which is the law of the human race even up to today those who are hindu follow the manusahit laws of inheritance and other legalities are derived from this book now in the manusahit it is clearly stated that a woman should not be given freedom that does not mean that women are to be kept as slaves but they are like children children are not given freedom but that does not mean that they are kept as slaves the demons have now neglected such injunctions and they think that women should be given as much freedom as men however this has not improved the social condition of the world actually a woman should be given protection at every stage of life she should be given protection by the father in her younger days by the husband in her youth and by the grownup sons in her old age this is proper social behavior according to the manusahit but modern education has artificially devised a puffed up concept of womanly life and therefore marriage is practically now an imagination in human society nor is the moral condition of woman very good now the demons therefore do not accept any instruction which is good for society and because they do not follow the experience of great sages and the rules and regulations laid down by the sages the social condition of the demoniac people is very miserable text 8 asatyam apratiha te jagad hur anvaram aparasparasambhta kim anyat kmahaitukam asatyamunreal

demoniac conclude that the world is phantasmagoria there is no cause no effect no controller no purpose everything is unreal they say that this cosmic manifestation arises due to chance material actions and reactions they do not think that the world was created by god for a certain purpose they have their own theory that the world has come about in its own way and that there is no reason to believe that there is a god behind it for them there is no difference between spirit and matter and they do not accept the supreme spirit everything is matter only and the whole cosmos is supposed to be a mass of ignorance according to them everything is void and whatever manifestation exists is due to our ignorance in perception they take it for granted that all manifestation of diversity is a display of ignorance just as in a dream we may create so many things which actually have no existence so when we are awake we shall see that everything is simply a dream but factually although the demons say that life is a dream they are very expert in enjoying this dream and so instead of acquiring knowledge they become more and more implicated in their dreamland they conclude that as a child is simply the result of sexual intercourse between man and woman this world is born without any soul for them it is only a combination of matter that has produced the living entities and there is no question of the existence of the soul as many living creatures come out from perspiration and from a dead body without any cause similarly the whole living world has come out of the material combinations of the cosmic manifestation therefore material nature is the cause of this manifestation and there is no other cause they do not believe in the words of ka in bhagavadgt maydhyakea prakti syate sacarcaram under my direction the whole material world is moving in other words amongst the demons there is no perfect knowledge of the creation of this world every one of them has some particular theory of his own according to them one interpretation of the scriptures is as good as another for they do not believe in a standard understanding of the scriptural injunctions text 9 et

horrible works meant to destroy the world purport the demoniac are engaged in activities that will lead the world to destruction the lord states here that they are less intelligent the materialists who have no concept of god think that they are advancing but according to bhagavadgt they are unintelligent and devoid of all sense they try to enjoy this material world to the utmost limit and therefore always engage in inventing something for sense gratification such materialistic inventions are considered to be advancement of human civilization but the result is that people grow more and more violent and more and more cruel cruel to animals and cruel to other human beings they have no idea how to behave toward one another animal killing is very prominent amongst demoniac people such people are considered the enemies of the world because ultimately they will invent or create something which will bring destruction to all indirectly this verse anticipates the invention of nuclear weapons of which the whole world is today very proud at any moment war may take place and these atomic weapons may create havoc such things are created solely for the destruction of the world and this is indicated here due to godlessness such weapons are invented in human society they are not meant for the peace and prosperity of the world text 10 kmam ritya dupra dambhamnamadnvit mohd ghtvsadgrhn

they are always full of anxieties on account of accepting nonpermanent things they still continue to engage in such activities out of illusion they have no knowledge and cannot tell that they are heading the wrong way accepting nonpermanent things such demoniac people create their own god create their own hymns and chant accordingly the result is that they become more and more attracted to two thingssex enjoyment and accumulation of material wealth the word aucivrat unclean vow is very significant in this connection such demoniac people are only attracted by wine women gambling and meat eating those are their auci unclean habits induced by pride and false prestige they create some principles of religion which are not approved by the vedic injunctions although such demoniac people are most abominable in the world still by artificial means the world creates a false honor for them although they are gliding toward hell they consider themselves very much advanced texts 1112 cintm

translation they believe that to gratify the senses unto the end of life is the prime necessity of human civilization thus there is no end to their anxiety being bound by hundreds and thousands of desires by lust and anger they secure money by illegal means for sense gratification purport the demoniac accept that the enjoyment of the senses is the ultimate goal of life and this concept they maintain until death they do not believe in life after death and they do not believe that one takes on different types of bodies according to ones karma or activities in this world their plans for life are never finished and they go on preparing plan after plan all of which are never finished we have personal experience of a person of such demoniac mentality who even at the point of death was requesting the physician to prolong his life for four years more because his plans were not yet complete such foolish people do not know that a physician cannot prolong life even for a moment when the notice is there there is no consideration of the mans desire the laws of nature do not allow a second beyond what one is destined to enjoy the demoniac person who has no faith in god or the supersoul within himself performs all kinds of sinful activities simply for sense gratification he does not know that there is a witness sitting within his heart the supersoul is observing the activities of the individual soul as it is stated in the vedic literature the upaniads there are two birds sitting in one tree the one is acting and enjoying or suffering the fruits of the branches and the other is witnessing but one who is demoniac has no knowledge of vedic scripture nor has he any faith therefore he feels free to do anything for sense enjoyment regardless of the consequences texts 1315 idam

network of illusions one becomes too strongly attached to sense enjoyment and falls down into hell purport the demoniac man knows no limit to his desire to acquire money that is unlimited he only thinks how much assessment he has just now and schemes to engage that stock of wealth farther and farther for that reason he does not hesitate to act in any sinful way and so deals in the black market for illegal gratification he is enamoured by the possessions he has already such as land family house and bank balance and he is always planning to improve them he believes in his own strength and he does not know that whatever he is gaining is due to his past good deeds he is given an opportunity to accumulate such things but he has no conception of past causes he simply thinks that all his mass of wealth is due to his own endeavor a demoniac person believes in the strength of his personal work not in the law of karma according to the law of karma a man takes his birth in a high family or becomes rich or very well educated or very beautiful because of good work in the past the demoniac thinks that all these things are accidental and due to the strength of his personal ability he does not sense any arrangement behind all the varieties of people beauty and education anyone who comes into competition with such a demoniac man is his enemy there are many demoniac people and each is enemy to the others this enmity becomes more and more deepbetween persons then between families then between societies and at last between nations therefore there is constant strife war and enmity all over the world each demoniac person thinks that he can live at the sacrifice of all others generally a demoniac person thinks of himself as the supreme god and a demoniac preacher tells his followers why are you seeking god elsewhere you are all yourselves god whatever you like you can do dont believe in god throw away god god is dead these are the demoniacs preachings although the demoniac person sees others equally rich and influential or even more so he thinks that no one is richer than him and that no one is more influential than him as far as promotion to the higher planetary system is concerned he does not believe in performing yajas or sacrifices demons think that they will manufacture their own process of yaja and prepare some machine by which they will be able to reach any higher planet the best example of such a demoniac man was rvaa he offered a program to the people by which he would prepare a staircase so that anyone could reach the heavenly planets without performing sacrifices such as are prescribed in the vedas similarly in the present age such demoniac men are striving to reach the higher planetary systems by mechanical arrangement these are examples of bewilderment the result is that without their knowledge they are gliding toward hell here the sanskrit word mohajla is very significant jla means net like fishes caught in a net they have no way to come out text 17 tmasambhvit stabdh dhanamnamadnvit yajante nmayajais te dambhenvidhiprvakam tmasambhvitselfcomplacent stabdhimpudent dhanamna wealth and false prestige madaanvitabsorbed in pride

impudent deluded by wealth and false prestige they sometimes perform sacrifices in name only without following any rules or regulations purport thinking themselves all in all not caring for any authority or scripture the demoniac sometimes perform socalled religious or sacrificial rites and since they do not believe in authority they are very impudent this is due to illusion caused by accumulating some wealth and false prestige sometimes such demons take up the role of preacher mislead the people and become known as religious reformers or as incarnations of god they make a show of performing sacrifices or they worship the demigods or manufacture their own god common men advertise them as god and worship them and by the foolish they are considered advanced in the principles of religion or in the principles of spiritual knowledge they take the dress of the renounced order of life and engage in all nonsense in that dress actually there are so many restrictions for one who has renounced this world the demons however do not care for such restrictions they think that whatever path one can create is ones own path there is no such thing as a standard path one has to follow the word avidhiprvakam meaning disregard for the rules and regulations is especially stressed here these things are always due to ignorance and illusion text 18 ahakra bala darpa kma krodha ca sarit mm

existence of the supreme personality of godhead this is caused by his socalled prestige and his accumulation of wealth and strength he does not know that the present life is a preparation for the next life not knowing this he is actually envious of his own self as well as of others he commits violence on other bodies and on his own he does not care for the supreme control of the personality of godhead because he has no knowledge being envious of the scriptures and the supreme personality of godhead he puts forward false arguments against the existence of god and refutes the scriptural authority he thinks himself independent and powerful in every action he thinks that since no one can equal him in strength power or in wealth he can act in any way and no one can stop him if he has an enemy who might check the advancement of his sensual activities he makes plans to cut him down by his own power text 19 tn aha dviata krrn sasreu nardhamn kipmy ajasram aubhn surv eva yoniu tnthose

translation those who are envious and mischievous who are the lowest among men are cast by me into the ocean of material existence into various demoniac species of life purport in this verse it is clearly indicated that the placing of a particular individual soul in a particular body is the prerogative of the supreme will the demoniac person may not agree to accept the supremacy of the lord and it is a fact that he may act according to his own whims but his next birth will depend upon the decision of the supreme personality of godhead and not on himself in the rmadbhgavatam third canto it is stated that an individual soul after his death is put into the womb of a mother where he gets a particular type of body under the supervision of superior power therefore in the material existence we find so many species of lifeanimals insects men and so on all are arranged by the superior power they are not accidental as for the demoniac it is clearly said here that they are perpetually put into the wombs of demons and thus they continue to be envious the lowest of mankind such demoniac species of life are held to be always full of lust always violent and hateful and always unclean they are just like so many beasts in a jungle text 20 sur yonim pann mh janmani janmani mm aprpyaiva kaunteya tato ynty adham gatim surmdemoniac yonimspecies panngaining mhthe foolish janmani janmaniin birth

demoniac life such persons can never approach me gradually they sink down to the most abominable type of existence purport it is known that god is allmerciful but here we find that god is never merciful to the demoniac it is clearly stated that the demoniac people life after life are put into the wombs of similar demons and not achieving the mercy of the supreme lord they go down and down so that at last they achieve bodies like those of cats dogs and hogs it is clearly stated that such demons have practically no chance of receiving the mercy of god at any stage of later life in the vedas also it is stated that such persons gradually sink to become dogs and hogs it may be then argued in this connection that god should not be advertised as allmerciful if he is not merciful to such demons in answer to this question in the vedntastra we find that the supreme lord has no hatred for anyone the placing of the asuras the demons in the lowest status of life is simply another feature of his mercy sometimes the asuras are killed by the supreme lord but this killing is also good for them for in vedic literature we find that anyone who is killed by the supreme lord becomes liberated there are instances in history of many asurasrvaa kasa hirayakaiputo whom the lord appeared in various incarnations just to kill therefore gods mercy is shown to the asuras if they are fortunate

to human life lust anger and greed the more a person is freed from lust anger and greed the more his existence becomes pure then he can follow the rules and regulations enjoined in the vedic literature by following the regulative principles of human life one gradually raises himself to the platform of spiritual realization if one is so fortunate by such practice to rise to the platform of ka consciousness then success is guaranteed for him in the vedic literature the ways of action and reaction are prescribed to enable one to come to the stage of purification the whole method is based on giving up lust greed and anger by cultivating knowledge of this process one can be elevated to the highest position of selfrealization this selfrealization is perfected in devotional service in that devotional service the liberation of the conditioned soul is guaranteed therefore according to the vedic system there are instituted the four orders of life and the four statuses of life called the caste system and the spiritual order system there are different rules and regulations for different castes or divisions of society and if a person is able to follow them he will be automatically raised to the highest platform of spiritual realization then he can have liberation without a doubt text 23 ya stravidhim utsjya vartate kmakrata na sa siddhim avpnoti na sukha na par gatim yaanyone

supreme gatimperfectional stage translation but he who discards scriptural injunctions and acts according to his own whims attains neither perfection nor happiness nor the supreme destination purport as described before the stravidhim or the direction of the stra is given to the different castes and orders of human society everyone is expected to follow these rules and regulations if one does not follow them and acts whimsically according to his lust greed and desire then he never will be perfect in his life in other words a man may theoretically know all these things but if he does not apply them in his own life then he is to be known as the lowest of mankind in the human form of life a living entity is expected to be sane and to follow the regulations given for elevating his life to the highest platform but if he does not follow them then he degrades himself but even if he follows the rules and regulations and moral principles and ultimately does not come to the stage of understanding the supreme lord then all his knowledge becomes spoiled therefore one should gradually raise himself to the platform of ka consciousness and devotional service it is then and there that he can attain the highest perfectional stage not otherwise the word kmacrata is very significant a person who knowingly violates the rules acts in lust he knows that this is forbidden still he acts this is called acting whimsically he knows that this should be done but still he does not do it therefore he is called whimsical such persons are destined to be condemned by the supreme lord such persons cannot have the perfection which is meant for the human life the human life is especially meant for purifying ones existence and one who does not follow the rules and regulations cannot purify himself nor can he attain the real stage of happiness text 24 tasmc chstra prama te krykryavyavasthitau jtv stravidhnokta karma kartum ihrhasi tasmttherefore stramscriptures pramamevidence teyour

understand what is duty and what is not duty by the regulations of the scriptures knowing such rules and regulations one should act so that he may gradually be elevated purport as stated in the fifteenth chapter all the rules and regulations of the vedas are meant for knowing ka if one understands ka from the bhagavadgt and becomes situated in ka consciousness engaging himself in devotional service he has reached the highest perfection of knowledge offered by the vedic literature lord caitanya mahprabhu made this process very easy he asked people simply to chant hare ka hare ka ka ka hare hare hare rma hare rma rma rma hare hare and to engage in the devotional service of the lord and eat the remnants of foodstuff offered to the deity one who is directly engaged in all these devotional activities is to be understood as having studied all vedic literature he has come to the conclusion perfectly of course for the ordinary persons who are not in ka consciousness or who are not engaged in devotional service what is to be done and what is not to be done must be decided by the injunctions of the vedas one should act accordingly without argument that is called following the principles of stra or scripture stra is without the four principal defects that are visible in the conditioned soul imperfect senses the propensity for cheating certainty of committing mistakes and certainty of being illusioned these four principal defects in conditioned life disqualify one from putting forth rules and regulations therefore the rules and regulations as described in the strabeing above these defectsare accepted without alteration by all great saints cryas and great souls in india there are many parties of spiritual understanding generally classified as two the impersonalist and the personalist both of them however lead their lives according to the principles of the vedas without following the principles of the scriptures one cannot elevate himself to the perfectional stage one who actually therefore understands the purport of the stras is considered fortunate in human society aversion to the principles of understanding the supreme personality of godhead is the cause of all falldowns that is the greatest offense of human life therefore my the material energy of the supreme personality of godhead is always giving us trouble in the shape of the threefold miseries this material energy is constituted of the three modes of material nature one has to raise himself at least to the mode of goodness before the path to understanding the supreme lord can be opened without raising oneself to the standard of the mode of goodness one remains in ignorance and passion which are the cause of demoniac life those in the modes of passion and ignorance deride the scriptures deride the holy man and deride the proper understanding of the spiritual master and they do not care for the regulations of the scriptures in spite of hearing the glories of devotional service they are not attracted thus they manufacture their own way of elevation these are some of the defects of human society which lead to the demoniac status of life if however one is able to be guided by a proper and bona fide spiritual master who can lead one to the path of elevation to the higher stage then ones life becomes successful thus end the bhaktivedanta purports to the sixteenth chapter of the rmadbhagavadgt in the matter of the divine and demoniac natures bg17 chapter seventeen the divisions of faith text 1 arjuna uvca ye stravidhim utsjya yajante raddhaynvit te nih tu k ka

kao ka sattvamin goodness hosaid rajain passion tamain ignorance translation arjuna said o ka what is the situation of one who does not follow the principles of scripture but worships according to his own imagination is he in goodness in passion or in ignorance purport in the fourth chapter thirtyninth verse it is said that a person faithful to a particular type of worship gradually becomes elevated to the stage of knowledge and attains the highest perfectional stage of peace and prosperity in the sixteenth chapter it is concluded that one who does not follow the principles laid down in the scriptures is called an asura demon and one who follows the scriptural injunctions faithfully is called a deva or demigod now if one with faith follows some rules which are not mentioned in the scriptural injunctions what is his position this doubt of arjuna is to be cleared by ka are those who create some sort of god by selecting a human being and placing their faith in him worshiping in goodness passion or ignorance do such persons attain the perfectional stage of life is it possible for them to be situated in real knowledge and elevate themselves to the highest perfectional stage do those who do not follow the rules and regulations of the scriptures but who have faith in something and worship gods and demigods and men attain success in their effort arjuna is putting these questions to ka text 2 r bhagavn uvca trividh bhavati raddh dehin s svabhvaj sttvik rjas caiva tmas ceti t u r bhagavn uvcathe supreme personality of godhead said trividh three kinds bhavatibecome

those who know the rules and regulations of the scriptures but out of laziness or indolence give up following these rules and regulations are governed by the modes of material nature according to their previous activities in the modes of goodness passion or ignorance they acquire a nature which is of a specific quality the association of the living entity with the different modes of nature has been going on perpetually since the living entity is in contact with material nature thus he acquires different types of mentality according to his association with the material modes but this nature can be changed if one associates with a bona fide spiritual master and abides by his rules and the scriptures gradually one can change his position from ignorance to goodness or from passion to goodness the conclusion is that blind faith in a particular mode of nature cannot help a person become elevated to the perfectional stage one has to consider things carefully with intelligence in the association of a bona fide spiritual master thus one can change his position to a higher mode of nature text 3 sattvnurp sarvasya raddh bhavati bhrata raddhmayo ya puruo yo yacchraddha sa eva sa

evacertainly sahe translation according to ones existence under the various modes of nature one evolves a particular kind of faith the living being is said to be of a particular faith according to the modes he has acquired purport everyone has a particular type of faith regardless of what he is but his faith is considered good passionate or ignorant according to the nature he has acquired thus according to his particular type of faith one associates with certain persons now the real fact is that every living being as is stated in the fifteenth chapter is originally the fragmental part and parcel of the supreme lord therefore one is originally transcendental to all the modes of material nature but when one forgets his relationship with the supreme personality of godhead and comes into contact with the material nature in conditional life he generates his own position by association with the different varieties of material nature the resultant artificial faith and existence are only material although one may be conducted by some impression or some conception of life still originally he is nirgua or transcendental therefore one has to become cleansed of the material contamination that he has acquired in order to regain his relationship with the supreme lord that is the only path back without fear ka consciousness if one is situated in ka consciousness then that path is guaranteed for his elevation to the perfectional stage if one does not take to this path of selfrealization then he is surely to be conducted by the influence of the modes of nature the word sattva or faith is very significant in this verse sattva or faith always comes out of the works of goodness ones faith may be in a demigod or some created god or some mental concoction it is supposed to be ones strong faith in something that is productive of the works of material goodness but in material conditional life no works of material nature are completely purified they are mixed they are not in pure goodness pure goodness is transcendental in purified goodness one can understand the real nature of the supreme personality of godhead as long as ones faith is not completely in purified goodness the faith is subject to contamination by any of the modes of material nature the contaminated modes of material nature expand to the heart therefore according to the position of the heart in contact with a particular mode of material nature ones faith is established it should be understood that if ones heart is in the mode of goodness his faith is also in the mode of goodness if his heart is in the mode of passion his faith is also in the mode of passion and if his heart is in the mode of darkness illusion his faith is also thus contaminated thus we find different types of faith in this world and there are different types of religions due to different types of faith the real principle of religious faith is situated in the mode of pure goodness but because the heart is tainted we find different types of religious principles thus according to different types of faith there are different kinds of worship text 4 yajante sttvik devn yakaraksi rjas pretn bhtaga cnye yajante tmas jan

worship ghosts and spirits purport in this verse the supreme personality of godhead describes different kinds of worshipers according to their external activities according to scriptural injunction only the supreme personality of godhead is worshipable but those who are not very conversant with or faithful to the scriptural injunctions worship different objects according to their specific situations in the modes of material nature those who are situated in goodness generally worship the demigods the demigods include brahm iva and others such as indra candra and the sungod there are various demigods those in goodness worship a particular demigod for a particular purpose similarly those who are in the mode of passion worship the demons we recall that during the second world war a man in calcutta worshiped hitler because thanks to that war he had amassed a large amount of wealth by dealing in the black market similarly those in the modes of passion and ignorance generally select a powerful man to be god they think that anyone can be worshiped as god and that the same results will be obtained now it is clearly described here that those who are in the mode of passion worship and create such gods and those who are in the mode of ignorance in darkness worship dead spirits sometimes people worship at the tomb of some dead man sexual service is also considered to be in the mode of darkness similarly in remote villages in india there are worshipers of ghosts we have seen that in india the lower class people sometimes go to the forest and if they have knowledge that a ghost lives in a tree they worship that tree and offer sacrifices these different kinds of worship are not actually god worship god worship is for persons who are transcendentally situated in pure goodness in the rmadbhgavatam it is said sattva viuddham vsudevaabditam when a man is situated in pure goodness he worships vsudeva the purport is that those who are completely purified of the material modes of nature and who are transcendentally situated can worship the supreme personality of godhead the impersonalists are supposed to be situated in the mode of goodness and they worship five kinds of demigods they worship the impersonal viu or viu form in the material world which is known as philosophized viu viu is the expansion of the supreme personality of godhead but the impersonalists because they do not ultimately believe in the supreme personality of godhead imagine that the viu form is just another aspect of the impersonal brahman similarly they imagine that lord brahm is the impersonal form in the material mode of passion thus they sometimes describe five kinds of gods that are worshipable but because they think that the actual truth is impersonal brahman they dispose of all worshipable objects at the ultimate end in conclusion the different qualities of the material modes of nature can be purified through association with persons who are of transcendental nature texts 56 astravihita ghora tapyante ye tapo jan dambhhakrasayukt kmargabalnvit karayanta arrastha bhtagrmam acetasa m caivnta arrastha tn viddhy suranicayn astranot mentioned in

of austerity and penances which are not mentioned in the scriptural injunctions for instance fasting for some ulterior purpose such as to promote a purely political end is not mentioned in the scriptural directions the scriptures recommend fasting for spiritual advancement not for some political end or social purpose persons who take to such austerities are according to bhagavadgt certainly demoniac their acts are against the scriptural injunction and are not beneficial for the people in general actually they act out of pride false ego lust and attachment for material enjoyment by such activities not only are the combination of material elements of which the body is constructed disturbed but also the supreme personality of godhead himself living within the body such unauthorized fasting or austerities for some political end are certainly very disturbing to others they are not mentioned in the vedic literature a demoniac person may think that he can force his enemy or other parties to comply with his desire by this method but sometimes one dies by such fasting these acts are not approved by the supreme personality of godhead and he says that those who engage in them are demons such demonstrations are insults to the supreme personality of godhead because they are enacted in disobedience to the vedic scriptural injunctions the word acetasa is significant in this connectionpersons of normal mental condition must obey the scriptural injunctions those who are not in such a position neglect and disobey the scriptures and manufacture their own way of austerities and penances one should always remember the ultimate end of the demoniac people as described in the previous chapter the lord forces them to take birth in the womb of demoniac persons consequently they will live by demoniac principles life after life without knowing their relationship with the supreme personality of godhead if however such persons are fortunate enough to be guided by a spiritual master who can direct them to the path of vedic wisdom they can get out of this entanglement and ultimately achieve the supreme goal text 7 hras tv api sarvasya trividho bhavati priya yajas

purport the purpose of food is to increase the duration of life purify the mind and aid bodily strength this is its only purpose in the past great authorities selected those foods that best aid health and increase lifes duration such as milk products sugar rice wheat fruits and vegetables these foods are very dear to those in the mode of goodness some other foods such as baked corn and molasses while not very palatable in themselves can be made pleasant when mixed with milk or other foods they are then in the mode of goodness all these foods are pure by nature they are quite distinct from untouchable things like meat and liquor fatty foods as mentioned in the eighth verse have no connection with animal fat obtained by slaughter animal fat is available in the form of milk which is the most wonderful of all foods milk butter cheese and similar products give animal fat in a form which rules out any need for the killing of innocent creatures it is only through brute mentality that this killing goes on the civilized method of obtaining needed fat is by milk slaughter is the way of subhumans protein is amply available through split peas dhall whole wheat etc foods in the mode of passion which are bitter too salty or too hot or overly mixed with red pepper cause misery by producing mucous in the stomach leading to disease foods in the mode of ignorance or darkness are essentially those that are not fresh any food cooked more than three hours before it is eaten except prasdam food offered to the lord is considered to be in the mode of darkness because they are decomposing such foods give a bad odor which often attracts people in this mode but repulses those in the mode of goodness remnants of food may be eaten only when they are part of a meal that was first offered to the supreme lord or first eaten by saintly persons especially the spiritual master otherwise the remnants of food are considered to be in the mode of darkness and they increase infection or disease such foodstuffs although very palatable to persons in the mode of darkness are neither liked nor even touched by those in the mode of goodness the best food is the remnant of what is offered to the supreme personality of godhead in bhagavadgt the supreme lord says that he accepts preparations of vegetables flour and milk when offered with devotion patra pupa phala toyam of course devotion and love are the chief things which the supreme personality of godhead accepts but it is also mentioned that the prasdam should be prepared in a particular way any food prepared by the injunction of the scripture offered to the supreme personality of godhead can be taken even if prepared long long ago because such food is transcendental therefore to make food antiseptic eatable and palatable for all persons one should offer food to the supreme personality of godhead text 11 aphalkkibhir yajo vidhido ya ijyate yaavyam eveti mana samdhya sa sttvika aphalakkibhidevoid of desire for

of sacrifices that sacrifice performed according to duty and to scriptural rules and with no expectation of reward is of the nature of goodness purport the general tendency is to offer sacrifice with some purpose in mind but here it is stated that sacrifice should be performed without any such desire it should be done as a matter of duty take for example the performance of rituals in temples or in churches generally they are performed with the purpose of material benefit but that is not in the mode of goodness one should go to a temple or church as a matter of duty offer respect to the supreme personality of godhead and offer flowers and eatables everyone thinks that there is no use in going to the temple just to worship god but worship for economic benefit is not recommended in the scriptural injunction one should go simply to offer respect to the deity that will place one in the mode of goodness it is the duty of every civilized man to obey the injunctions of the scriptures and offer respect to the supreme personality of godhead text 12 abhisandhya tu phala dambhrtham api caiva yat ijyate bharatareha ta yaja viddhi rjasam abhisandhyadesiring tubut phalamthe result

in the mode of darkness or ignorance is actually faithlessness sometimes people worship some demigod just to make money and then spend the money for recreation ignoring the scriptural injunctions such

different kinds of austerity and penance first he explains the austerities and penances practiced by the body one should offer or learn to offer respect to god or to the demigods the perfect qualified brhmaas and the spiritual master and superiors like father mother or any person who is conversant with vedic knowledge these should be given proper respect one should practice cleansing oneself externally and internally and he should learn to become simple in behavior he should not do anything which is not sanctioned by the scriptural injunction he should not indulge in sex outside of

instruction of his students but such a teacher should not speak to others who are not his students if he will agitate their minds this is penance as far as talking is concerned besides that one should not talk nonsense when speaking in spiritual circles ones statements must be upheld by the scriptures one should at once quote from scriptural authority to back up what he is saying at the same time such talk should be very pleasurable to the ear by such discussions one may derive the highest benefit and elevate human society there is a limitless stock of vedic literature and one should study

selfcontrol and purity of thought are the austerities of the mind purport to make the mind austere is to detach it from sense gratification it should be so trained that it can be always thinking of doing good for others the best training for the mind is gravity in thought one should not deviate from ka consciousness and must always avoid sense gratification to purify ones nature is to become ka conscious satisfaction of the mind can be obtained only by taking the mind away from thoughts of sense enjoyment the more we think of sense enjoyment the more the mind becomes dissatisfied in the present age we unnecessarily engage the mind in so many different ways for sense gratification and so there is no possibility of the minds becoming satisfied the best course is to divert the mind to the vedic literature which is full of satisfying stories as in the puras and the mahbhrata one can take advantage of this knowledge and thus become purified the mind should be devoid of duplicity and one should think of the welfare of all silence means that one is always thinking of selfrealization the person in ka consciousness observes perfect silence in this sense control of the mind means detaching the mind from sense enjoyment one should be straightforward in his dealing and thereby purify his existence all these qualities together constitute austerity in mental activities text 17

who performed austere penances to become immortal and kill the demigods he prayed to brahm for such things but ultimately he was killed by the supreme personality of godhead to undergo penances for

vedic literature charity given to a person engaged in spiritual activities is recommended there is no recommendation for giving charity indiscriminately spiritual perfection is always a consideration therefore charity is recommended to be given at a place of pilgrimage and at lunar or solar eclipses or at the end of the month or to a qualified brhmaa or a vaiava devotee or in temples such charities should be given without any consideration of return charity to the poor is sometimes given out of compassion but if a poor man is not worth giving charity to then there is no spiritual advancement in other words indiscriminate charity is not recommended in the vedic literature text 21 yat tu pratyupakrrtha phalam uddiya v puna dyate ca pariklia tad dna rjasa smtam yatthat which

also sometimes made under some obligation at the request of a superior these kinds of charity are said to be made in the mode of passion there are many charitable foundations which offer their gifts

syllablesom tat sat have been used to indicate the supreme absolute truth brahman they were uttered by brhmaas while chanting vedic hymns and during sacrifices for the satisfaction of the supreme purport it has been explained that penance sacrifice charity and foods are divided into three categories the modes of goodness passion and ignorance but whether first class second class or third class they are all conditioned contaminated by the material modes of nature when they are aimed at the supremeom tat sat the supreme personality of godhead the eternalthey become means for spiritual elevation in the scriptural injunctions such an objective is indicated these three words om tat sat particularly indicate the absolute truth the supreme personality of godhead in the vedic hymns the word om is always found one who acts without following the regulations of the scriptures will not attain the absolute truth he will get some temporary result but not the ultimate end of life the conclusion is that the performance of charities sacrifice and penance must be done in the mode of goodness performed in the modes of passion or ignorance they are certainly inferior in quality the three words om tat sat are uttered in conjunction with the holy name of the supreme lord eg om tad vio whenever a vedic hymn or the holy name of the supreme lord is uttered om is added this is the indication of vedic literature these three words are taken from vedic hymns om ity etad brahmao nedia nma indicates the first goal then tattvamasi indicates the second goal and sad eva saumya indicates the third goal combined they become om tat sat formerly when brahm the first created living entity performed sacrifices he spoke these three names of the supreme personality of godhead the same principle holds by disciplic succession so this hymn has great significance bhagavadgt recommends therefore that any work done should be done for om tat sat or for the supreme personality of godhead when one performs penance charity and sacrifice with these three words he is acting in ka consciousness ka consciousness is a scientific execution of transcendental activities which enables one to return home back to godhead there is no loss of energy in acting in such a transcendental way text 24 tasmd om ity udhtya yajadnatapakriy pravartante vidhnokt satata brahmavdinm tasmttherefore

sacrifice and it is indicated by the word sat these works of sacrifice of penance and of charity true to the absolute nature are performed to please the supreme person o son of pth purport the words praaste karmai or prescribed duties indicate that there are many activities prescribed in the vedic literature which are purificatory processes beginning from parental care up to the end of ones life such purificatory processes are adopted for the ultimate liberation of the living entity in all such activities it is recommended that one should vibrate om tat sat the words sadbhve and sdhubhve indicate the transcendental situation one who is acting in ka consciousness is called sattva and one who is fully conscious of activities in ka consciousness is called svarpa in the rmadbhgavatam it is said that the transcendental subject matter becomes clear in the association of the devotees without good association one cannot achieve transcendental knowledge when initiating a person or offering the sacred thread one vibrates the words om tat sat similarly in all kinds of yogic performances the supreme object om tat sat is invoked these words om tat sat are used to perfect all activities this supreme om tat sat makes everything complete text 28 araddhay huta datta tapas tapta kta ca yat asad ity ucyate prtha na ca tat pretya no iha araddhaywithout faith hutamperformed

translation but sacrifices austerities and charities performed without faith in the supreme are nonpermanent o son of pth regardless of whatever rites are performed they are called asat and are useless both in this life and the next purport anything done without the transcendental objectivewhether it be sacrifice charity or penanceis useless therefore in this verse it is declared that such activities are abominable everything should be done for the supreme in ka consciousness without such faith and without the proper guidance there can never be any fruit in all the vedic scriptures faith in the supreme is advised in the pursuit of all vedic instructions the ultimate goal is the understanding of ka no one can obtain success without following this principle therefore the best course is to work from the very beginning in ka consciousness under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master that is the way to make everything successful in the conditional state people are attracted to worship demigods ghosts or yakas like kuvera the mode of goodness is better than the modes of passion and ignorance but one who takes directly to ka consciousness is transcendental to all three modes of material nature although there is a process of gradual elevation if one by the association of pure devotees takes directly to ka consciousness that is the best way and that is recommended in this chapter to achieve success in this way one must first find the proper spiritual master and receive training under his direction then one can achieve faith in the supreme when that faith matures in course of time it is called love of god this love is the ultimate goal of the living entities one should therefore take to kra consciousness directly that is the message of this seventeenth chapter thus end the bhaktivedanta purports to the seventeenth chapter of the rmadbhagavadgt in the matter of the divisions of faith bg18 chapter eighteen conclusion the perfection of

purpose of renunciation tyga and of the renounced order of life sannysa o killer of the ke demon hkea purport actually the bhagavadgt is finished in seventeen chapters the eighteenth chapter is a supplementary summarization of the topics discussed before in every chapter of bhagavadgt lord ka stresses that devotional service unto the supreme personality of godhead is the ultimate goal of life this same point is summarized in the eighteenth chapter as the most confidential path of knowledge in the first six chapters stress was given to devotional service yoginm api sarvem of all yogs or transcendentalists one who always thinks of me within himself is best in the next six chapters pure devotional service and its nature and activity were discussed in the third six chapters knowledge renunciation the activities of material nature and transcendental nature and devotional service were described it was concluded that all acts should be performed in conjunction with the supreme lord summarized by the words om tat sat which indicate viu the supreme person in the third part of bhagavadgt devotional service was established by the example of past cryas and the brahma stra the vedntastra which cites that devotional service is the ultimate purpose of life and nothing else certain impersonalists consider themselves monopolizers of the knowledge of vedntastra but actually the vedntastra is meant for understanding devotional service for the lord himself is the composer of the vedntastra and he is its knower that is described in the fifteenth chapter in every scripture every veda devotional service is the objective that is explained in bhagavadgt as in the second chapter a synopsis of the whole subject matter was described similarly in the eighteenth chapter also the summary of all instruction is given the purpose of life is indicated to be renunciation and attainment of the transcendental position above the three material modes of nature arjuna wants to clarify the two distinct subject matters of bhagavad gt namely renunciation tyga and the renounced order of life sannysa thus he is asking the meaning of these two words two words used in this verse to address the supreme lordhkea and keinisdanaare significant hkea is ka the master of all senses who can always help us attain mental serenity arjuna requests him to summarize everything in such a way that he can remain equiposed yet he has some doubts and doubts are always compared to demons he therefore addresses ka as keinisdana ke was a most formidable demon who was killed by the lord now arjuna is expecting ka to kill the demon of doubt text 2 r bhagavn uvca kmyn karma nysa sannysa kavayo vidu sarvakarmaphalatyga prhus tyga vicaka r bhagavn uvcathe supreme personality of godhead said

great learned men purport the performance of activities for results has to be given up this is the instruction of bhagavadgt but activities leading to advanced spiritual knowledge are not to be given up this will be made clear in the next verse there are many prescriptions of methods for performing sacrifice for some particular purpose in the vedic literatures there are certain sacrifices to perform to attain a good son or to attain elevation to the higher planets but sacrifices prompted by desires should be stopped however sacrifice for the purification of ones heart or for advancement in the spiritual science should not be given up text 3 tyjya doavad ity eke karma prhur mania yajadnatapakarma na tyjyam iti cpare tyjyammust be given up doavatas an evil itithus ekeone group

kinds of fruitive activities should be given up but there are yet other sages who maintain that acts of sacrifice charity and penance should never be abandoned purport there are many activities in the vedic literatures which are subjects of contention for instance it is said that an animal can be killed in a sacrifice yet some maintain animal killing is completely abominable although animal killing in a sacrifice is recommended in the vedic literature the animal is not considered to be killed the sacrifice is to give a new life to the animal sometimes the animal is given a new animal life after being killed in the sacrifice and sometimes the animal is promoted immediately to the human form of life but there are different opinions among the sages some say that animal killing should always be avoided and others say that for a specific sacrifice it is good all these different opinions on sacrificial activity are now being clarified by the lord himself text 4 nicaya u me tatra tyge

renunciation declared in the scriptures purport although there are differences of opinion about renunciation here the supreme personality of godhead r ka gives his judgment which should be taken as final after all the vedas are different laws given by the lord here the lord is personally present and his word should be taken as final the lord says that the process of renunciation should be considered in terms of the modes of material nature in which they are performed text 5 yajadnatapakarma na tyjya kryam eva tat yajo dna tapa caiva pvanni manim yajasacrifice dnacharity tapapenance

translation acts of sacrifice charity and penance are not to be given up but should be performed indeed sacrifice charity and penance purify even the great souls purport the yogs should perform acts for the advancement of human society there are many purificatory processes for advancing a human being to spiritual life the marriage ceremony for example is considered to be one of these sacrifices it is called vivhayaja should a sannys who is in the renounced order of life and who has given up his family relations encourage the marriage ceremony the lord says here that any sacrifice which is meant for human welfare should never be given up vivhayaja the marriage ceremony is meant to regulate the human mind to become peaceful for spiritual advancement for most men this vivhayaja should be encouraged even by persons in the renounced order of life sannyass should never associate with women but that does not mean that one who is in the lower stages of life a young man should not accept a wife in the marriage ceremony all prescribed sacrifices are meant for achieving the supreme lord therefore in the lower stages they should not be given up similarly charity is for the purification of the heart if charity is given to suitable persons as described previously it leads one to advanced spiritual life text 6 etny api tu karmi saga tyaktv phalni ca kartavynti me prtha nicita matam

although all sacrifices are purifying one should not expect any result by such performances in other words all sacrifices which are meant for material advancement in life should be given up but sacrifices that purify ones existence and elevate one to the spiritual plane should not be stopped everything that leads to ka consciousness must be encouraged in the rmadbhgavatam also it is said that any activity which leads to devotional service to the lord should be accepted that is the highest criterion of religion a devotee of the lord should accept any kind of work sacrifice or charity which will help him in the discharge of devotional service to the lord text 7 niyatasya tu sannysa karmao nopapadyate moht tasya paritygas tmasa parikrtita niyatasyaprescribed duties tubut

should never be renounced if by illusion one gives up his prescribed duties such renunciation is said to be in the mode of ignorance purport work for material satisfaction must be given up but activities which promote one to spiritual activity like cooking for the supreme lord and offering the food to the lord and then accepting the food are recommended it is said that a person in the renounced order of life should not cook for himself cooking for oneself is prohibited but cooking for the supreme lord is not prohibited similarly a sannys may perform a marriage ceremony to help his disciple in the advancement of ka consciousness if one renounces such activities it is to be understood that he is acting in the mode of darkness text 8 dukham ity eva yat karma kyakleabhayt tyajet sa

engage his money in ka consciousness or if by rising early in the morning one can advance his transcendental ka consciousness one should not desist out of fear or because such activities are considered troublesome such renunciation is in the mode of passion the result of passionate work is always miserable even if a person renounces work in that spirit he never gets the result of

performed with this mentality one should act without attachment for the result he should be disassociated from the modes of work a man working in ka consciousness in a factory does not associate himself with the work of the factory nor with the workers of the factory he simply works for ka and when he gives up the result for ka he is acting transcendentally text 10 na dvey akuala karma kuale

purport it is said in bhagavadgt that one can never give up work at any time therefore he who works for ka and does not enjoy the fruitive results who offers everything to ka is actually a renouncer there are many members of the international society for krishna consciousness who work very hard in their office or in the factory or some other place and whatever they earn they give to the society such highly elevated souls are actually sannyss and are situated in the renounced order of life it is clearly outlined here how to renounce the fruits of work and for what purpose fruits should be

therefore he does not have to enjoy or suffer the results of his acts after death text 12 aniam ia mira ca trividha karmaa phalam bhavaty atygin pretya na tu sannysin kvacit aniamleading to hell

which bring about the accomplishment of all action these are declared in skhya philosophy to be the place of action the performer the senses the endeavor and ultimately the supersoul purport a question may be raised that since any activity performed must have some reaction how is it that the person in ka consciousness does not suffer or enjoy the reactions of work the lord is citing vednta philosophy to show how this is possible he says that there are five causes for all activities and for success in all activity and one should know these five causes skhya means the stalk of knowledge and vednta is the final stalk of knowledge accepted by all leading cryas even akara accepts vedntastra as such therefore such authority should be consulted the ultimate will is invested in the supersoul as it is stated in the gt sarvasya cha hdi he is engaging everyone in certain activities acts done under his direction from within yield no reaction either in this life or in the life after death the instruments of action are the senses and by senses the soul acts in various ways and for each and every action there is a different endeavor but all ones activities depend on the will of the supersoul who is seated within the heart as a friend the supreme lord is the super cause under these circumstances he who is acting in ka consciousness under the direction of the supersoul situated within the heart is naturally not bound by any activity those in complete ka consciousness are not ultimately responsible for their actions everything is dependent on the supreme will the supersoul the supreme personality of godhead text 15 arravmanobhir yat karma prrabhate nara nyyya v viparta v pacaite tasya hetava arrabody vkspeech manobhiby the mind yatanything karmawork prrabhatebegins

five factors purport the words right and wrong are very significant in this verse right work is work done in terms of the prescribed directions in the scriptures and wrong work is work done against the principles of the scriptural injunctions but whatever is done requires these five factors for its complete performance text 16 tatraiva sati kartram tmna kevala tu ya payaty aktabuddhitvn na sa

cannot understand that the supersoul is sitting as a friend within and conducting his actions although the material causes are the place the worker the endeavor and the senses the final cause is the supreme the personality of godhead therefore one should see not only the four material causes but the supreme efficient cause as well one who does not see the supreme thinks himself to be the

entangled though he kills men in this world is not the slayer nor is he bound by his actions purport in this verse the lord informs arjuna that the desire not to fight arises from false ego arjuna thought himself to be the doer of action but he did not consider the supreme sanction within and without if one does not know that a super sanction is there why should he act but one who knows the instrument of work himself as the worker and the supreme lord as the supreme sanctioner is perfect in doing everything such a person is never in illusion personal activity and responsibility arise from false ego and godlessness or a lack of ka consciousness anyone who is acting in ka consciousness under the direction of the supersoul or the supreme personality of godhead even though killing does not kill nor is he ever affected with the reaction of such killing when a soldier kills under the command of a superior officer he is not subject to be judged but if a soldier kills on his own personal account then he is certainly judged by a court of law text 18 jna jeya parijt trividh karmacodan karaa karma karteti trividha karma sagraha jnamknowledge jeyamobjective parijtthe knower

knower are the three factors which motivate action the senses the work and the doer comprise the threefold basis of action purport there are three kinds of impetus for daily work knowledge the object of knowledge and the knower the instruments of work the work itself and the worker are called the constituents of work any work done by any human being has these elements before one acts there is some impetus which is called inspiration any solution arrived at before work is actualized is a subtle form of work then work takes the form of action first one has to undergo the psychological processes of thinking feeling and willing and that is called impetus actually the faith to perform acts is called knowledge the inspiration to work is the same if it comes from the scripture or from the instruction of the spiritual master when the inspiration is there and the worker is there then actual activity takes place by the help of the senses the mind is the center of all senses and the object is work itself these are the different phases of work as described in bhagavadgt the sum total of all activities is called accumulation of work text 19 jna karma ca kart ca tridhaiva guabhedata

guasakhynein terms of different modes yathvatas they act uhear tniall of them api also translation in accordance with the three modes of material nature there are three kinds of knowledge action and performers of action listen as i describe them purport in the fourteenth chapter the three divisions of the modes of material nature were elaborately described in that chapter it was said that the mode of goodness is illuminating the mode of passion materialistic and the mode of ignorance conducive to laziness and indolence all the modes of material nature are binding they are not sources of liberation even in the mode of goodness one is conditioned in the seventeenth chapter the different types of worship by different types of men in different modes of material nature were described in this verse the lord wishes to speak about the different types of knowledge workers and work itself according to the three material modes text 20 sarvabhteu yenaika bhvam avyayam kate avibhakta

jnam knowledge viddhiknows sttvikamin the mode of goodness translation that knowledge by which one undivided spiritual nature is seen in all existences undivided in the divided is knowledge in the mode of goodness purport a person who sees one spirit soul in every living being whether a demigod human being animal bird beast aquatic or plant possesses knowledge in the mode of goodness in all living entities one spirit soul is there although they have different bodies in terms of their previous work as described in the seventh chapter the manifestation of the living force in every body is due to the superior nature of the supreme lord thus to see that one superior nature that living force in every body is to see in the mode of goodness that living energy is imperishable although the bodies are perishable the difference is perceived in terms of the body because there are many forms of material existence in conditional life therefore they appear to be divided such impersonal knowledge finally leads to selfrealization text 21 pthaktvena tu yaj jna nnbhvn pthagvidhn vetti sarveu bhteu taj jna viddhi rjasam pthaktvenabecause of division tubut yat jnamwhich knowledge

knowledge by which a different type of living entity is seen to be dwelling in different bodies is knowledge in the mode of passion purport the concept that the material body is the living entity and that with the destruction of the body the consciousness is also destroyed is called knowledge in the mode of passion according to that knowledge bodies differ from one another because of the development of different types of consciousness otherwise there is no separate soul which manifests consciousness the body is itself the soul and there is no separate soul beyond this body according to such knowledge consciousness is temporary or else there are no individual souls but there is an allpervading soul which is full of knowledge and this body is a manifestation of temporary ignorance or beyond this body there is no special individual or supreme soul all such conceptions are considered products of the mode of passion text 22 yat tu ktsnavad ekasmin krye saktam ahaitukam

tatthat tmasamin the mode of darkness udhtamis spoken translation and that knowledge by which one is attached to one kind of work as the all in all without knowledge of the truth and which is very meager is said to be in the mode of darkness purport the knowledge of the common man is always in the mode of darkness or ignorance because every living entity in conditional life is born into the mode of ignorance one who does not develop knowledge through the authorities or scriptural injunctions has knowledge that is limited to the body he is not concerned about acting in terms of the directions of scripture for him god is money and knowledge means the satisfaction of bodily demands such knowledge has no connection with the absolute truth it is more or less like the knowledge of the ordinary animals the knowledge of eating sleeping defending and mating such knowledge is described here as the product of the mode of darkness in other words knowledge concerning the spirit soul beyond this body is called knowledge in the mode of goodness and knowledge producing many theories and doctrines by dint of mundane logic and mental speculation is the product of the mode of passion and knowledge concerned with only keeping the body comfortable is said to be in the mode of ignorance text 23 niyata sagarahitam argadveata ktam aphalaprepsun karma yat tat sttvikam ucyate

therefore without any love or hatred and performed in ka consciousness for the satisfaction of the supreme without selfsatisfaction or selfgratification are called actions in the mode of goodness text

has to give account of ones actions to the state or to the agents of the supreme lord called the yamadtas irresponsible work is distraction because it destroys the regulative principles of scriptural injunction it is often based on violence and is distressing to other living entities such irresponsible work is carried out in the light of ones personal experience this is called illusion and all such illusory work is a product of the mode of ignorance text 26 muktasago nahavd dhtyutshasamanvita siddhyasiddhyor nirvikra kart sttvika ucyate muktasagaliberated from all material association

mode of passion purport a person is too much attached to certain kind of work or to the result because he has too much attachment for materialism or hearth and home wife and children such a person has no desire for higher elevation of life he is simply concerned with making this world as materially comfortable as possible he is generally very greedy and he thinks that anything attained by him is permanent and never to be lost such a person is envious of others and prepared to do anything wrong for sense gratification therefore such a person is unclean and he does not care whether his earning

sort of work should be performed and what sort of work should not be performed those who do not care for those injunctions engage in work not to be done and such persons are generally materialistic they work according to the modes of nature not according to the injunctions of the scripture such workers are not very gentle and generally they are always cunning and expert in insulting others they are very lazy even though they have some duty they do not do it properly and they put it aside to be done later on therefore they appear to be morose they procrastinate anything which can be done in

happiness which the conditioned soul enjoys and by which he sometimes comes to the end of all distress that which in the beginning may be just like poison but at the end is just like nectar and which awakens one to selfrealization is said to be happiness in the mode of goodness purport a conditioned soul tries to enjoy material happiness again and again thus he chews the chewed but sometimes in the course of such enjoyment he becomes relieved from material entanglement by association with a great soul in other words a conditioned soul is always engaged in some type of sense gratification but when he understands by good association that it is only a repetition of the same thing and he is awakened to his real ka consciousness he is sometimes relieved from such repetitive socalled happiness in the pursuit of selfrealization one has to follow many rules and regulations to control the mind and the senses and to concentrate the mind on the self all these procedures are very difficult bitter like poison but if one is successful in following the regulations and comes to the transcendental position he begins to drink real nectar and he enjoys life text 38 viayendriyasayogd yat tad agre

worshiping siddhimperfection vindatiachieves mnavaa man translation by worship of the lord who is the source of all beings and who is allpervading man can in the performance of his own duty attain perfection purport as stated in the fifteenth chapter all living beings are fragmental parts and parcels of the supreme lord as such the supreme lord is the beginning of all living entities this is confirmed in the vedntastra janmdy asya yata the supreme lord is therefore the beginning of life of every living entity and the supreme lord by his two energies his external energy and internal energy is allpervading therefore one should worship the supreme lord with his energies generally the vaiava devotees worship the supreme lord with his internal energy his external energy is a perverted reflection of the internal energy the external energy is a background but the supreme lord by the expansion of his plenary portion as paramtm is situated everywhere he is the supersoul of all demigods all human beings all animals everywhere one should therefore know that as part and parcel of the supreme lord it is his duty to render service unto the supreme everyone should be engaged in devotional service to the lord in full ka consciousness that is recommended in this verse everyone should think that he is engaged in a particular type of occupation by hkea the master of the senses and by the result of the work in which one is engaged the supreme personality of godhead r ka should be worshiped if one thinks always in this way in full ka consciousness then by the grace of the lord he becomes fully aware of everything that is the perfection of life the lord says in bhagavadgt tem aha samuddhart the supreme lord himself takes charge of delivering such a devotee that is the highest perfection of life in whatever occupation one may be engaged if he serves the supreme lord he will achieve the highest perfection text 47 reyn svadharmo vigua paradharmt svanuhitt svabhvaniyata karma

nature karmawork kurvanperforming nanever pnotiachieve kilbiamsinful reactions translation it is better to engage in ones own occupation even though one may perform it imperfectly than to accept anothers occupation and perform it perfectly prescribed duties according to ones nature are never affected by sinful reactions purport ones occupational duty is prescribed in bhagavadgt as already discussed in previous verses the duties of a brhmaa katriya vaiya and dra are prescribed according to the particular modes of nature one should not imitate anothers duty a man who is by nature attracted to the kind of work done by dras should not artificially claim himself to be a brhmaa although he may be born into a brhmaa family in this way one should work according to his own nature no work is abominable if performed in the service of the supreme lord the occupational duty of a brhmaa is certainly in the mode of goodness but if a person is not by nature in the mode of goodness he should not imitate the occupational duty of a brhmaa for a katriya or administrator there are so many abominable things a katriya has to be violent to kill his enemies and sometimes a katriya has to tell lies for the sake of diplomacy such violence and duplicity accompany political affairs but a katriya is not supposed to give up his occupational duty and try to perform the duties of a brhmaa one should act to satisfy the supreme lord for example arjuna was a katriya he was hesitating to fight the other party but if such fighting is performed for the sake of ka the supreme personality of godhead there need be no fear of degradation in the business field also sometimes a merchant has to tell so many lies to make a profit if he does not do so there can be no profit sometimes a merchant says oh my dear customer for you i am making no profit but one should know that without profit the merchant cannot exist therefore it should be taken as a simple lie if a merchant says that he is not making a profit but the merchant should not think that because he is engaged in an occupation in which the telling of lies is compulsory he should give up his profession and pursue the profession of a brhmaa that is not recommended whether one is a katriya a vaiya or a dra doesnt matter if he serves by his work the supreme personality of godhead even brhmaas who perform different types of sacrifice sometimes must kill animals because sometimes animals are sacrificed in such ceremonies similarly if a katriya engaged in his own occupation kills an enemy there is no sin incurred in the third chapter these matters have been clearly and elaborately explained every man should work for the purpose of yaja or for viu the supreme personality of godhead anything done for personal sense gratification is a cause of bondage the conclusion is that everyone should be engaged according to the particular mode of nature he has acquired and he should decide to work only to serve the supreme cause of the supreme lord text 48 sahaja karma kaunteya sadoam api na tyajet sarvrambh hi doea dhmengnir ivvt sahajamborn simultaneously karmawork kaunteyao son of kunt sadoamwith fault apialthough

covered by smoke therefore one should not give up the work which is born of his nature o son of kunt even if such work is full of fault purport in conditioned life all work is contaminated by the material modes of nature even if one is a brhmaa he has to perform sacrifices in which animal killing is necessary similarly a katriya however pious he may be has to fight enemies he cannot avoid it similarly a merchant however pious he may be must sometimes hide his profit to stay in business or he may sometimes have to do business on the black market these things are necessary one cannot avoid them similarly even though a man is a dra serving a bad master he has to carry out the order of the master even though it should not be done despite these flaws one should continue to carry out his prescribed duties for they are born out of his own nature a very nice example is given herein although fire is pure still there is smoke yet smoke does not make the fire impure even though there is smoke in the fire fire is still considered to be the purest of all elements if one prefers to give up the work of a katriya and take up the occupation of a brhmaa he is not assured that in the occupation of a brhmaa there are no unpleasant duties one may then conclude that in the material world no one can be completely free from the contamination of material nature this example of fire and smoke is very appropriate in this connection when in wintertime one takes a stone from the fire sometimes smoke disturbs the eyes and other parts of the body but still one must make use of the fire despite disturbing conditions similarly one should not give up his natural occupation because there are some disturbing elements rather one should be determined to serve the supreme lord by his occupational duty in ka consciousness that is the perfectional point when a particular type of occupation is performed for the satisfaction of the supreme lord all the defects in that particular occupation are purified when the results of work are purified when connected with devotional service one becomes perfect in seeing the self within and that is selfrealization text 49 asaktabuddhi

siddhimperfection of nonreaction parammsupreme sannysenaby the renounced order of life adhigacchatiattains translation one can obtain the results of renunciation simply by selfcontrol and by becoming unattached to material things and disregarding material enjoyments that is the highest perfectional stage of renunciation purport real renunciation means that one should always think himself part and parcel of the supreme lord therefore he has no right to enjoy the results of his work since he is part and parcel of the supreme lord the results of his work must be enjoyed by the supreme lord this is actually ka consciousness the person acting in ka consciousness is really a sannys one in the renounced order of life by such mentality one is satisfied because he is actually acting for the supreme thus he is not attached to anything material he becomes accustomed to not taking pleasure in anything beyond the transcendental happiness derived from the service of the lord a sannys is supposed to be free from the reactions of his past activities but a person who is in ka consciousness automatically attains this perfection without even accepting the socalled order of renunciation this state of mind is called yogrha or the perfectional stage of yoga as confirmed in the third chapter yas tv tmaratir eva syt one who is satisfied in himself has no fear of any kind of reaction from his activity text 50 siddhi prpto yath brahma tathpnoti nibodha me samsenaiva kaunteya nih jnasya y par siddhimperfection prptaachieving yathas brahmathe supreme tathso pnotiachieves nibodhatry to

the supreme perfectional stage brahman by acting in the way which i shall now summarize purport the lord describes for arjuna how one can achieve the highest perfectional stage simply by being engaged in his occupational duty performing that duty for the supreme personality of godhead one attains the supreme stage of brahman simply by renouncing the result of his work for the satisfaction of the supreme lord that is the process of selfrealization actual perfection of knowledge is in attaining pure ka consciousness that is described in the following verses texts 5153 buddhy viuddhay yukto

intelligence and controlling the mind with determination giving up the objects of sense gratification being freed from attachment and hatred one who lives in a secluded place who eats little and who controls the body and the tongue and is always in trance and is detached who is without false ego false strength false pride lust anger and who does not accept material things such a person is certainly elevated to the position of selfrealization purport when one is purified by knowledge he keeps himself in the mode of goodness thus one becomes the controller of the mind and is always in trance because he is not attached to the objects of sense gratification he does not eat more than what he requires and he controls the activities of his body and mind he has no false ego because he does not accept the body as himself nor has he a desire to make the body fat and strong by accepting so many material things because he has no bodily concept of life he is not falsely proud he is satisfied with everything that is offered to him by the grace of the lord and he is never angry in the absence of sense gratification nor does he endeavor to acquire sense objects thus when he is completely free from false ego he becomes nonattached to all material things and that is the stage of selfrealization of brahman that stage is called the brahmabhta stage when one is free from the material conception of life he becomes peaceful and cannot be agitated text 54 brahmabhta prasanntm na ocati na kkati sama sarveu bhteu madbhakti labhate parm brahmabhtabeing one with the absolute prasannatmfully joyful nanever ocatilaments nanever kkatidesires sama equally disposed sarveuall bhteuliving entity matbhaktimmy devotional service labhategains parmtranscendental translation one who is thus transcendentally situated at once realizes the supreme brahman he never laments nor desires to have anything he is equally disposed to every living entity in that state he attains pure devotional service unto me purport to the impersonalist achieving the brahmabhta stage becoming one with the absolute is the last word but for the personalist or pure devotee one has to go still further to become engaged in pure devotional service this means that one who is engaged in pure devotional service to the supreme lord is already in a state of liberation called brahmabhta oneness with the absolute without being one with the supreme the absolute one cannot render service unto him in the absolute conception there is no difference between the served and the servitor yet the distinction is there in a higher spiritual sense in the material concept of life when one works for sense gratification there is misery but in the absolute world when one is engaged in pure devotional service there is no misery the devotee in ka consciousness has nothing to lament or desire since god is full a living entity who is engaged in gods service in ka consciousness becomes also full in himself he is just like a river cleansed of all dirty water because a pure devotee has no thought other than ka he is naturally always joyful he does not lament for any material loss or gain because he is full in service of the lord he has no desire for material enjoyment because he knows that every living entity is the fragmental part and parcel of the supreme lord and therefore eternally a servant he does not see in the material world someone as higher and someone as lower higher and lower positions are ephemeral and a devotee has nothing to do with ephemeral appearances or disappearances for him stone and gold are of equal value this is the brahmabhta stage and this stage is attained very easily by the pure devotee in that stage of existence the idea of becoming one with the supreme brahman and annihilating ones individuality becomes hellish and the idea of attaining the heavenly kingdom becomes phantasmagoria and the senses are like broken serpents teeth as there is no fear of a serpent with broken teeth so there is no fear from the senses when they are automatically controlled the world is miserable for the materially infected person but for a devotee the entire world is as good as vaikuha or the spiritual sky the highest personality in this material universe is no more significant than an ant for a devotee such a stage can be achieved by the mercy of lord caitanya who preached pure devotional service in this age text 55 bhakty mm abhijnti yvn ya csmi tattvata tato m tattvato jtv viate tadanantaram bhaktyby pure devotional service mmme abhijntione can know yvnas much as ya ca asmias i am tattvatain truth tata thereafter mmme tattvataby truth jtvknowing viate enters tatthereafter anantaramafter translation one can understand the supreme personality as he is only by devotional service and when one is in full consciousness of the supreme lord by such devotion he can enter into the kingdom of god purport the supreme personality of godhead ka and his plenary portions cannot be understood by mental speculation nor by the nondevotees if anyone wants to understand the supreme personality of godhead he has to take to pure devotional service under the guidance of a pure devotee otherwise the truth of the supreme personality of godhead will always be hidden it is already stated nha praka that he is not revealed to everyone everyone cannot understand god simply by erudite scholarship or mental speculation only one who is actually engaged in ka consciousness and devotional service can understand what ka is university degrees are not helpful one who is fully conversant with the ka science becomes eligible to enter into the spiritual kingdom the abode of ka becoming brahman does not mean that one loses his identity devotional service is there and as long as devotional service exists there must be god the devotee and the process of devotional service such knowledge is never vanquished even after liberation liberation involves getting free from the concept of material life in spiritual life the same distinction is there the same individuality is there but in pure ka consciousness one should not misunderstand that the word viate enters into me supports the monist theory that one becomes homogeneous with the impersonal brahman no viate means that one can enter into the abode of the supreme lord in his individuality to engage in his association and render service unto him for instance a green bird enters a green tree not to become one with the tree but to enjoy the fruits of the tree impersonalists generally give the example of a river flowing into the ocean and merging this may be a source of happiness for the impersonalist but the personalist keeps his personal individuality like an aquatic in the ocean we find so many living entities within the ocean if we go deep surface acquaintance with the ocean is not sufficient one must have complete knowledge of the aquatics living in the ocean depths because of his pure devotional service a devotee can understand the transcendental qualities and the opulences of the supreme lord in truth as it is stated in the eleventh chapter only by devotional service can one understand the same is confirmed here one can understand the supreme personality of godhead by devotional service and enter into his kingdom after attainment of the brahmabhta stage of freedom from material conceptions devotional service begins by ones hearing about the lord when one hears about the supreme lord automatically the brahmabhta stage develops and material contaminationgreediness and lust for sense enjoymentdisappears as lust and desires disappear from the heart of a devotee he becomes more attached to the service of the lord and by such attachment he becomes free from material contamination in that state of life he can understand the supreme lord this is the statement of rmadbhgavatam also also after liberation the process of bhakti or transcendental service continues the vedntastra confirms this pryat tatrpi hi dam this means that after liberation the process of devotional service continues in the rmadbhgavatam real devotional liberation is defined as the reinstatement of the living entity in his own identity his own constitutional position the constitutional position is already explained every living entity is the part and parcel fragmental portion of the supreme lord therefore his constitutional position is to serve after liberation this service is never stopped actual liberation is getting free from misconceptions of life text 56 sarvakarmy api sad kurvo madvyapraya matprasdd avpnoti vata padam avyayam sarvaall karmiactivities apialthough sadalways kurva performing matunder my vyaprayahprotection matmy prasdt

representative the spiritual master there is no time limitation for a pure devotee he is always twentyfour hours one hundred percent engaged in activities under the direction of the supreme lord to a devotee who is thus engaged in ka consciousness the lord is very very kind in spite of all difficulties he is eventually placed in the transcendental abode or kaloka he is guaranteed entrance there there is no doubt about it in that supreme abode there is no change everything is eternal imperishable and full of knowledge text 57 cetas sarvakarmi mayi sannyasya matpara buddhiyogam upritya

consciousness satatamtwentyfour hours a day bhavajust become translation in all activities just depend upon me and work always under my protection in such devotional service be fully conscious of me purport when one acts in ka consciousness he does not act as the master of the world just like a servant one should act fully under the direction of the supreme lord a servant has no individual independence he acts only on the order of the master a servant acting on behalf of the supreme master has no affection for profit and loss he simply discharges his duty faithfully in terms of the order of the lord now one may argue that arjuna was acting under the personal direction of ka but when ka is not present how should one act if one acts according to the direction of ka in this book as well as under the guidance of the representative of ka then the result will be the same the sanskrit word matpara is very important in this verse it indicates that one has no goal in life save and except acting in ka consciousness just to satisfy ka and while working in that way one should think of ka only i have been appointed to discharge this particular duty by ka while acting in such a way one naturally has to think of ka this is perfect ka consciousness one should however note that after doing something whimsically he should not offer the result to the supreme lord that sort of duty is not in the devotional service of ka consciousness one should act according to the order of ka this is a very important point that order of ka comes through disciplic succession from the bona fide spiritual master therefore the spiritual masters order should be taken as the prime duty of life if one gets a bona fide spiritual master and acts according to his direction then his perfection of life in ka consciousness is guaranteed text 58 maccitta sarvadurgi matprasdt tariyasi atha cet tvam ahakrn na royasi vinakyasi matmy cittaconsciousness sarvaall durgiimpediments mat my prasdtmy mercy

obstacles of conditional life by my grace if however you do not work in such consciousness but act through false ego not hearing me you will be lost purport a person in full ka consciousness is not unduly anxious to execute the duties of his existence the foolish cannot understand this great freedom from all anxiety for one who acts in ka consciousness lord ka becomes the most intimate friend he always looks after his friends comfort and he gives himself to his friend who is so devotedly engaged working twentyfour hours a day to please the lord therefore no one should be carried away by the false ego of the bodily concept of life one should not falsely think himself independent of the laws of material nature or free to act he is already under strict material laws but as soon as he acts in ka consciousness he is liberated free from the material perplexities one should note very carefully that one who is not active in ka consciousness is losing himself in the material whirlpool in the ocean of birth and death no conditioned soul actually knows what is to be done and what is not to be done but a person who acts in ka consciousness is free to act because everything is prompted by ka from within and confirmed by the spiritual master text 59 yad ahakram ritya na yotsya iti manyase mithyaia vyavasyas te praktis tv niyokyati yattherefore ahakramfalse ego rityataking shelter nanot

direction and do not fight then you will be falsely directed by your nature you will have to be engaged in warfare purport arjuna was a military man and born of the nature of the katriya therefore his natural duty was to fight but due to false ego he was fearing that by killing his teacher grandfather and friends there would be sinful reactions actually he was considering himself master of his actions as if he were directing the good and bad results of such work he forgot that the supreme personality of godhead was present there instructing him to fight that is the forgetfulness of the conditioned soul the supreme personality gives directions as to what is good and what is bad and one simply has to act in ka consciousness to attain the perfection of life no one can ascertain his destiny as the supreme lord can therefore the best course is to take direction from the supreme lord and act no one should neglect the order of the supreme personality of godhead or the order of the spiritual master who is the representative of god one should act unhesitatingly to execute the order of the supreme personality of godheadthat will keep him safe under all circumstances text 60

your own nature you will act all the same o son of kunt purport if one refuses to act under the direction of the supreme lord then he is compelled to act by the modes in which he is situated everyone is under the spell of a particular combination of the modes of nature and is acting in that way but anyone who voluntarily engages himself under the direction of the supreme lord becomes glorious text

and is directing the wanderings of all living entities who are seated as on a machine made of the material energy purport arjuna was not the supreme knower and his decision to fight or not to fight was confined to his limited discretion lord ka instructed that the individual is not all in all the supreme personality of godhead or he himself ka the localized supersoul sits in the heart directing the living being after changing bodies the living entity forgets his past deeds but the supersoul as the knower of the past present and future remains the witness of all his activities therefore all the activities of living entities are directed by this supersoul the living entity gets what he deserves and is carried by the material body which is created in the material energy under the direction of the supersoul as soon as a living entity is placed in a particular type of body he has to work under the spell of that bodily situation a person seated in a highspeed motor car goes faster than one seated in a slower car though the living entities the drivers may be the same similarly by the order of the supreme soul material nature fashions a particular type of body to a particular type of living entity to work according to his past desires the living entity is not independent one should not think himself independent of the supreme personality of godhead the individual is always under his control therefore his duty is to surrender and that is the injunction of the next verse text 62 tam eva araa gaccha sarvabhvena bhrata tatprasdt par nti sthna prpsyasi vatam tamunto him

scion of bharata surrender unto him utterly by his grace you will attain transcendental peace and the supreme and eternal abode purport a living entity should therefore surrender unto the supreme personality of godhead who is situated in everyones heart and that will relieve him from all kinds of miseries of this material existence by such surrender one will not only be released from all miseries in this life but at the end he will reach the supreme god the transcendental world is described in the vedic literature as tad vio parama padam since all of creation is the kingdom of god everything material is actually spiritual but parama padam specifically refers to the eternal abode which is called the spiritual sky or vaikuha in the fifteenth chapter of bhagavadgt it is stated sarvasya cham hdi sannivia the lord is seated in everyones heart so this recommendation that one should surrender unto the supersoul sitting within means that one should surrender unto the supreme personality of godhead ka ka has already been accepted by arjuna as the supreme he was accepted in the tenth chapter as para brahma para dhma arjuna has accepted ka as the supreme personality of godhead and the supreme abode of all living entities not only because of his personal experience but also because of the evidences of great authorities like nrada asita devala and vysa text 63 iti te

to do purport the lord has already explained to arjuna the knowledge of brahmabhta one who is in the brahmabhta condition is joyful he never laments nor does he desire anything that is due to confidential knowledge ka also discloses knowledge of the supersoul this is also brahman knowledge knowledge of brahman but it is superior here lord ka tells arjuna that he can do as he chooses god does not interfere with the little independence of the living entity in bhagavadgt the lord has explained in all respects how one can elevate his living condition the best advice imparted to arjuna is to surrender unto the supersoul seated within his heart by right discrimination one should agree to act according to the order of the supersoul that will help one become situated constantly in ka consciousness the highest perfectional stage of human life arjuna is being directly ordered by the personality of godhead to fight surrender to the supreme personality of godhead is in the best interest of the living entities it is not for the interest of the supreme before surrendering one is free to deliberate on this subject as far as the intelligence goes that is the best way to accept the instruction of the supreme personality of godhead such instruction comes also through the spiritual master the bona fide representative of ka text 64 sarvaguhyatama bhya u me parama vaca io si me

the lord has given arjuna confidential knowledge of the supersoul within everyones heart and now he is giving the most confidential part of this knowledge just surrender unto the supreme personality of godhead at the end of the ninth chapter he has said just always think of me the same instruction is repeated here to stress the essence of the teachings of bhagavadgt this essence is not understood by a common man but by one who is actually very dear to ka a pure devotee of ka this is the most important instruction in all vedic literature what ka is saying in this connection is the most essential part of knowledge and it should be carried out not only by arjuna but by all living entities text 65 manman bhava madbhakto madyj m namaskuru mm evaiyasi satya te pratijne priyo si me

asiyou are memy translation always think of me and become my devotee worship me and offer your homage unto me thus you will come to me without fail i promise you this because you are my very dear friend purport the most confidential part of knowledge is that one should become a pure devotee of ka and always think of him and act for him one should not become an official meditator life should be so molded that one will always have the chance to think of ka one should always act in such a way that all his daily activities are in connection with ka he should arrange his life in such a way that throughout the twentyfour hours he cannot but think of ka and the lords promise is that anyone who is in such pure ka consciousness will certainly return to the abode of ka where he will be engaged in the association of ka face to face this most confidential part of knowledge is spoken to arjuna because he is the dear friend of ka everyone who follows the path of arjuna can become a dear friend to ka and obtain the same perfection as arjuna these words stress that one should concentrate his mind upon kathe very form with two hands carrying a flute the bluish boy with a beautiful face and peacock feathers in his hair there are descriptions of ka found in the brahmasahit and other literatures one should fix his mind on this original form of godhead ka he should not even divert his attention to other forms of the lord the lord has multiforms as viu nryaa rma varha etc but a devotee should concentrate his mind on the form that was present before arjuna concentration of the mind on the form of ka constitutes the most confidential part of knowledge and this is disclosed to arjuna because arjuna is the most dear friend of kas text 66 sarvadharmn parityajya mm eka araa vraja aha

deliver m not ucaworry translation abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto me i shall deliver you from all sinful reaction do not fear purport the lord has described various kinds of knowledge processes of religion knowledge of the supreme brahman knowledge of the supersoul knowledge of the different types of orders and statuses of social life knowledge of the renounced order of life knowledge of nonattachment sense and mind control meditation etc he has described in so many ways different types of religion now in summarizing bhagavadgt the lord says that arjuna should give up all the processes that have been explained to him he should simply surrender to ka that surrender will save him from all kinds of sinful reactions for the lord personally promises to protect him in the eighth chapter it was said that only one who has become free from all sinful reactions can take to the worship of lord ka thus one may think that unless he is free from all sinful reactions he cannot take to the surrendering process to such doubts it is here said that even if one is not free from all sinful reactions simply by the process of surrendering to r ka he is automatically freed there is no need of strenuous effort to free oneself from sinful reactions one should unhesitatingly accept ka as the supreme savior of all living entities with faith and love one should surrender unto him according to the devotional process one should simply accept such religious principles that will lead ultimately to the devotional service of the lord one may perform a particular occupational duty according to his position in the social order but if by executing his duty one does not come to the point of ka consciousness all his activities are in vain anything that does not lead to the perfectional stage of ka consciousness should be avoided one should be confident that in all circumstances ka will protect him from all difficulties there is no need of thinking how one should keep the body and soul together ka will see to that one should always think himself helpless and should consider ka the only basis for his progress in life as soon as one seriously engages himself in devotional service to the lord in full ka consciousness at once he becomes freed from all contamination of material nature there are different processes of religion and purificatory processes by cultivation of knowledge meditation in the mystic yoga system etc but one who surrenders unto ka does not have to execute so many methods that simple surrender unto ka will save him from unnecessarily wasting time one can thus make all progress at once and be freed from all sinful reaction one should be attracted by the beautiful vision of ka his name is ka because he is allattractive one who becomes attracted by the beautiful allpowerful omnipotent vision of ka is fortunate there are different kinds of transcendentalistssome of them are attached to the impersonal brahman vision some of them are attracted by the supersoul feature etc but one who is attracted to the personal feature of the supreme personality of godhead and above all one who is attracted by the supreme personality of godhead as ka himself is the most perfect transcendentalist in other words devotional service to ka in full consciousness is the most confidential part of knowledge and this is the essence of the whole bhagavadgt karmayogs empiric philosophers mystics and devotees are all called transcendentalists but one who is a pure devotee is the best of all the particular words used here m uca dont fear dont hesitate dont worry are very significant one may be perplexed as to how one can give up all kinds of religious forms and simply surrender unto ka but such worry is useless text 67

devotional service in ka consciousness who have not tended a pure devotee and especially those who are conscious of ka as a historical personality or who are envious of the greatness of ka should not be told this most confidential part of knowledge it is however sometimes found that even demoniac persons who are envious of ka worshiping ka in a different way take to the profession of explaining bhagavadgt in a different way to make business but anyone who desires actually to understand ka must avoid such commentaries on bhagavadgt actually the purpose of bhagavadgt is not understandable to those who are sensuouseven if one is not sensuous but is strictly following the disciplines enjoined in the vedic scripture if he is not a devotee he also cannot understand ka even when one poses himself as a devotee of ka but is not engaged in ka conscious activities he also cannot understand ka there are many persons who envy ka because he has explained in bhagavadgt that he is the supreme and that nothing is above him or equal to him there are many persons who are envious of ka such persons should not be told of bhagavadgt for they cannot understand there is no possibility of faithless persons understanding bhagavadgt and ka without understanding ka from the authority of a pure devotee one should not try to comment upon bhagavadgit text 68 ya ida parama guhya madbhaktev abhidhsyati

who do not accept ka as he is and bhagavadgt as it is should not try to explain bhagavadgt whimsically and become offenders bhagavadgt should be explained to persons who are ready to accept ka as the supreme personality of godhead it is a subject matter for the devotees only and not for philosophical speculators anyone however who tries sincerely to present bhagavadgt as it is will advance in

one who listens with faith and without envy becomes free from sinful reaction and attains to the planets where the pious dwell purport in the 67th verse of this chapter the lord explicitly forbade the gts being spoken to those who are envious of the lord in other words bhagavadgt is for the devotees only but it so happens that sometimes a devotee of the lord will hold open class and in that class all the students are not expected to be devotees why do such persons hold open class it is explained here that although everyone is not a devotee still there are many men who are not envious of ka they have faith in him as the supreme personality of godhead if such persons hear from a bona fide devotee about the lord the result is that they become at once free from all sinful reactions and after that attain to the planetary system where all righteous persons are situated therefore simply by hearing bhagavadgt even a person who does not try to be a pure devotee attains the result of righteous activities thus a pure devotee of the lord gives everyone a chance to become free from all sinful reactions and to become a devotee of the lord generally those who are free from sinful reaction are righteous such persons very easily take to ka consciousness the word puyakarmam is very significant here this refers to the performance of great sacrifice those who are righteous in performing devotional service but who are not pure can attain the planetary system of the polestar or dhruvaloka where dhruva mahrja is presiding he is a great devotee of the lord and he has a special planet which is called the polestar text 72 kaccid etac chruta prtha tvayaikgrea cetas kaccid ajnasammoha praaas te dhanajaya kaccitwhether etatthis rutamheard prthao son of pth tvayby you ekgreawith

attentively with your mind and are your illusions and ignorance now dispelled purport the lord was acting as the spiritual master of arjuna therefore it was his duty to inquire from arjuna whether he understood the whole bhagavadgt in its proper perspective if not the lord was ready to reexplain any point or the whole bhagavadgt if so required actually anyone who hears bhagavadgt from a bona fide spiritual master like ka or his representative will find that all his ignorance is dispelled bhagavadgt is not an ordinary book written by a poet or fiction writer it is spoken by the supreme personality of godhead any person if he is fortunate enough to hear these teachings from ka or from his bona fide spiritual representative is sure to become a liberated person and get out of the darkness of ignorance text 73 arjuna uvca nao moha smtir labdh tvatprasdn maycyuta sthito smi gatasandeha kariye vacana tava arjuna uvcaarjuna said naadispelled mohaillusion smti memory labdhregained

infallible one my illusion is now gone i have regained my memory by your mercy and i am now firm and free from doubt and am prepared to act according to your instructions purport the constitutional position of a living entity represented by arjuna is that he has to act according to the order of the supreme lord he is meant for selfdiscipline r caitanya mahprabhu says that the actual position of the living entity is that of eternal servant of the supreme lord forgetting this principle the living entity becomes conditioned by material nature but in serving the supreme lord he becomes the liberated servant of god the living entitys constitutional position is to be servitor he either has to serve the illusory my or the supreme lord if he serves the supreme lord he is in his normal condition but if he prefers to serve the illusory external energy then certainly he will be in bondage in illusion the living entity is serving in this material world he is bound by his lust and desires yet he thinks of himself as the master of the world this is called illusion when a person is liberated his illusion is over and he voluntarily surrenders unto the supreme to act according to his desires the last illusion the last snare of my to trap the living entity is the proposition that he is god the living entity thinks that he is no longer a conditioned soul but god he is so unintelligent that he does not think that if he were god then how could he be in doubt that he does not consider so that is the last snare of illusion actually to become free from the illusory energy is to understand ka the supreme personality of godhead and agree to act according to his order the word moha is very important in this verse moha refers to that which is opposed to knowledge actually real knowledge is the understanding that every living being is eternally servitor of the lord but instead of thinking oneself in that position the living entity thinks that he is not servant that he is the master of this material world for he wants to lord it over the material nature that is his illusion this illusion can be overcome by the mercy of the lord or by the mercy of a pure devotee when that illusion is over one agrees to act in ka consciousness ka consciousness is acting according to kas order a conditioned soul illusioned by the external energy of matter does not know that the supreme lord is the master who is full of knowledge and who is the proprietor of everything whatever he desires he can bestow upon his devotees he is the friend of everyone and he is especially inclined to his devotee he is the controller of this material nature and of all living entities he is also the controller of inexhaustible time and he is full of all opulences and all potencies the supreme personality of godhead can even give himself to the devotee one who does not know him is under the spell of illusion he does not become a devotee but a servitor of my arjuna however after hearing bhagavadgt from the supreme personality of godhead became free from all illusion he could understand that ka was not only his friend but the supreme personality of godhead and he understood ka factually so to study bhagavadgt is to understand ka factually when a person is in full knowledge he naturally surrenders to ka when arjuna understood that it was kas plan to reduce the unnecessary increase of population he agreed to fight according to kas desire he again took up his weaponshis arrows and bowto fight under the order of the supreme personality of godhead text 74 sajaya uvca ity

imamthis arauamheard adbhutam wonder romaharaamhair standing on end translation sajaya said thus have i heard the conversation of two great souls ka and arjuna and so wonderful is that message that my hair is standing on end purport in the beginning of bhagavadgt dhtarra inquired from his secretary sajaya what happened in the battlefield of kuruketra the entire study was related to the heart of sajaya by the grace of his spiritual master vysa he thus explained the theme of the battlefield the conversation was wonderful because such an important conversation between two great souls never took place before and would not take place again it is wonderful because the supreme personality of godhead is speaking about himself and his energies to the living entity arjuna a great devotee of the lord if we follow in the footsteps of arjuna to understand ka then our life will be happy and successful sajaya realized this and as he began to understand it he related the conversation to dhtarra now it is concluded that wherever there is ka and arjuna there is victory text 75 vysaprasdc chrutavn etad guhyam aha param yoga yogevart kt skt kathayata svayam vysaprasdtby the mercy of vysadeva

mercy of vysa i have heard these most confidential talks directly from the master of all mysticism ka who was speaking personally to arjuna purport vysa was the spiritual master of sajaya and sajaya admits that it was by his mercy that he could understand the supreme personality of godhead this means that one has to understand ka not directly but through the medium of the spiritual master the spiritual master is the transparent medium although it is true that the experience is direct this is the mystery of the disciplic succession when the spiritual master is bona fide then one can hear bhagavadgt directly as arjuna heard it there are many mystics and yogs all over the world but ka is the master of all yoga systems kas instruction is explicitly stated in bhagavadgtsurrender unto ka one who does so is the topmost yog this is confirmed in the last verse of the sixth chapter yoginm api sarvem nrada is the direct disciple of ka and the spiritual master of vysa therefore vysa is as bona fide as arjuna because he comes in the disciplic succession and sajaya is the direct disciple of vysa therefore by the grace of vysa his senses were purified and he could see and hear ka directly one who directly hears ka can understand this confidential knowledge if one does not come to the disciplic succession he cannot hear ka therefore his knowledge is always imperfect at least as far as understanding bhagavadgt is concerned in bhagavadgt all the yoga systems karmayoga jnayoga and bhaktiyoga are explained ka is the master of all such mysticism it is to be understood however that as arjuna was fortunate enough to understand ka directly similarly by the grace of vysa sajaya was also able to hear ka directly actually there is no difference in hearing directly from ka or hearing directly from ka via a bona fide spiritual master like vysa the spiritual master is the representative of vysadeva also according to the vedic system on the birthday of the spiritual master the disciples conduct the ceremony called vysapj text 76 rjan sasmtya sasmtya savdam imam adbhutam keavrjunayo puya hymi ca muhur muhu rjano king sasmtyaremembering sasmtyaremembering savdammessage

between ka and arjuna i take pleasure being thrilled at every moment purport the understanding of bhagavadgt is so transcendental that anyone who becomes conversant with the topics of arjuna and ka becomes righteous and he cannot forget such talks this is the transcendental position of spiritual life in other words one who hears the gt from the right source directly from ka attains full ka consciousness the result of ka consciousness is that one becomes increasingly enlightened and he enjoys life with a thrill not only for some time but at every moment text 77 tac ca sasmtya sasmtya

sajaya also by the grace of vysa could see the universal form of ka exhibited to arjuna it is of course said that lord ka never exhibited such a form before it was exhibited to arjuna only yet some great devotees could also see the universal form of ka when it was shown to arjuna and vysa was one of them he is one of the great devotees of the lord and he is considered to be a powerful incarnation of ka vysa disclosed this to his disciple sajaya who remembered that wonderful form of ka exhibited to arjuna and enjoyed it repeatedly text 78 yatra yogevara ko yatra prtho dhanurdhara

vijaya victory bhti exceptional power dhruvcertainly ntimorality mati mamais my opinion translation wherever there is ka the master of all mystics and wherever there is arjuna the supreme archer there will also certainly be opulence victory extraordinary power and morality that is my opinion purport the bhagavadgt began with an inquiry of dhtarra he was hopeful of the victory of his sons assisted by great warriors like bhma droa and kara he was hopeful that the victory would be on his side but after describing the scene in the battlefield sajaya told the king you are thinking of victory but my opinion is that where ka and arjuna are present there will be all good fortune he directly confirmed that dhtarra could not expect victory for his side victory was certain for the side of arjuna because ka was there kas acceptance of the post of charioteer for arjuna was an exhibition of another opulence ka is full of all opulences and renunciation is one of them there are many instances of such renunciation for ka is also the master of renunciation the fight was actually between duryodhana and yudhihira arjuna was fighting on behalf of his elder brother yudhihira because ka and arjuna were on the side of yudhihira yudhihiras victory was certain the battle was to decide who would rule the world and sajaya predicted that the power would be transferred to yudhihira it is also predicted here that yudhihira after gaining victory in this battle would flourish more and more because he was not only righteous and pious but he was a strict moralist he never spoke a lie during his life there are many less intelligent persons who take bhagavadgt to be a discussion of topics between two friends in a battlefield but such a book cannot be scripture some may protest that ka incited arjuna to fight which is immoral but the reality of the situation is clearly stated bhagavadgt is the supreme instruction in morality the supreme instruction of morality is stated in the ninth chapter in the thirtyfourth verse manman bhava madbhakta one must become a devotee of ka and the essence of all religion is to surrender unto ka as stated sarvadharmn the instructions of bhagavadgt constitute the supreme process of religion and of morality all other processes may be purifying and may lead to this process but the last instruction of the gt is the last word in all morality and religion surrender unto ka this is the verdict of the eighteenth chapter from bhagavadgt we can understand that to realize oneself by philosophical speculation and by meditation is one process but to fully surrender unto ka is the highest perfection this is the essence of the teachings of bhagavadgt the path of regulative principles according to the orders of social life and according to the different courses of religion may be a confidential path of knowledge in as far as the rituals of religion are confidential but one is still involved with meditation and cultivation of knowledge surrender unto ka in devotional service in full ka consciousness is the most confidential instruction and is the essence of the eighteenth chapter another feature of bhagavadgt is that the actual truth is the supreme personality of godhead ka absolute truth is realized in three features impersonal brahman localized paramtm and the supreme personality of godhead ka perfect knowledge of the absolute truth means perfect knowledge of ka if one understands ka then all the departments of knowledge are part and parcel of that understanding ka is transcendental for he is always situated in his eternal internal potency the living entities are manifested and are divided into two classes eternally conditioned and eternally liberated such living entities are innumerable and they are considered fundamental parts of ka material energy is manifested into twentyfour divisions the creation is effected by eternal time and it is created and dissolved by external energy this manifestation of the cosmic world repeatedly becomes visible and invisible in bhagavadgt five principal subject matters have been discussed the supreme personality of godhead material nature the living entities eternal time and all kinds of activities all of these are dependent on the supreme personality of godhead ka all conceptions of the absolute truth namely impersonal brahman localized paramtm or any other transcendental conception exist within the category of understanding the supreme personality of godhead although superficially the supreme personality of godhead the living entity material nature and time appear to be different nothing is different from the supreme but the supreme is always different from everything lord caitanyas philosophy is that of inconceivably one and different this system of philosophy constitutes perfect knowledge of the absolute truth the living entity in his original position is pure spirit he is just like an atomic particle of the supreme spirit the conditioned living entity however is the marginal energy of the lord he tends to be in contact with both the material energy and the spiritual energy in other words the living entity is situated between the two energies of the lord and because he belongs to the superior energy of the lord he has a particle of independence by proper use of that independence he comes under the direct order of ka thus he attains his normal condition in the pleasuregiving potency thus end the bhaktivedanta purports to the eighteenth chapter of the rmadbhagavadgt in the matter of its conclusionsthe perfection of renunciation
