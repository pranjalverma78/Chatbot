manu explained it to ikvku and in that way by disciplic succession one speaker after another this yoga system has been coming down but in the course of time it has become lost consequently the lord has to speak it again this time to arjuna on the battlefield of kuruketra he tells arjuna that he is relating this supreme secret to him because arjuna is his devotee and his friend the purport of this is that bhagavadgt is a treatise which is especially meant for the devotee of the lord there are three classes of transcendentalists namely the jn the yog and the bhakta or the impersonalist the meditator and the devotee here the lord clearly tells arjuna that he is making him the first receiver of a new parampar disciplic succession because the old succession was broken it was the lords wish therefore to establish another parampar in the same line of thought that was coming down from the sungod to others and it was his wish that his teaching be distributed anew by arjuna he wanted arjuna to become the authority in understanding the bhagavadgt so we see that bhagavadgt is instructed to arjuna especially because arjuna was a devotee of the lord a direct student of ka and his intimate friend therefore bhagavadgt is best understood by a person who has qualities similar to arjunas that is to say he must be a devotee in a direct relationship with the lord as soon as one becomes a devotee of the lord he also has a direct relationship with the lord that is a very elaborate subject matter but briefly it can be stated that a devotee is in a relationship with the supreme personality of godhead in one of five different ways 1 one may be a devotee in a passive state 2 one may be a devotee in an active state 3 one may be a devotee as a friend 4 one may be a devotee as a parent 5 one may be a devotee as a conjugal lover arjuna was in a relationship with the lord as friend of course there is a gulf of difference between this friendship and the friendship found in the material world this is transcendental friendship which cannot be had by everyone of course everyone has a particular relationship with the lord and copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved that relationship is evoked by the perfection of devotional service but in the present status of our life not only have we forgotten the supreme lord but we have forgotten our eternal relationship with the lord every living being out of the many many billions and trillions of living beings has a particular relationship with the lord eternally that is called svarpa by the process of devotional service one can revive that svarpa and that stage is called svarpasiddhi perfection of ones constitutional position so arjuna was a devotee and he was in touch with the supreme lord in friendship how arjuna accepted this bhagavadgt should be noted his manner of acceptance is given in the tenth chapter 101214 arjuna uvca para brahma para dhma pavitra parama bhavn purua vata divyam didevam aja vibhum hus tvm aya sarve devarir nradas tath asito devalo vysa svaya caiva bravi me sarvam etad ta manye yan m vadasi keava na hi te bhagavan vyakti vidur dev na dnav arjuna said you are the supreme personality of godhead the ultimate abode the purest the absolute truth you are the eternal transcendental original person the unborn the greatest all the great sages such as nrada asita devala and vysa confirm this truth about you and now you yourself are declaring it to me o ka i totally accept as truth all that you have told me neither the demigods nor the demons o lord can understand your personality after hearing bhagavadgt from the supreme personality of godhead copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved arjuna accepted ka as para brahma the supreme brahman every living being is brahman but the supreme living being or the supreme personality of godhead is the supreme brahman para dhma means that he is the supreme rest or abode of everything pavitram means that he is pure untainted by material contamination puruam means that he is the supreme enjoyer vatam original divyam transcendental didevam the supreme personality of godhead ajam the unborn and vibhum the greatest now one may think that because ka was the friend of arjuna arjuna was telling him all this by way of flattery but arjuna just to drive out this kind of doubt from the minds of the readers of bhagavadgt substantiates these praises in the next verse when he says that ka is accepted as the supreme personality of godhead not only by himself but by authorities like nrada asita devala and vysadeva these are great personalities who distribute the vedic knowledge as it is accepted by all cryas therefore arjuna tells ka that he accepts whatever he says to be completely perfect sarvam etad ta manye i accept everything you say to be true arjuna also says that the personality of the lord is very difficult to understand and that he cannot be known even by the great demigods this means that the lord cannot even be known by personalities greater than human beings so how can a human being understand lord r ka without becoming his devotee therefore bhagavadgt should be taken up in a spirit of devotion one should not think that he is equal to ka nor should he think that ka is an ordinary personality or even a very great personality lord r ka is the supreme personality of godhead so according to the statements of bhagavadgt or the statements of arjuna the person who is trying to understand the bhagavadgt we should at least theoretically accept r ka as the supreme personality of godhead and with that submissive spirit we can understand the bhagavadgt unless one reads the bhagavadgt in a submissive spirit it is very difficult to understand bhagavadgt because it is a great mystery just what is the bhagavadgt the purpose of bhagavadgt is to deliver mankind from the nescience of material existence every man is in difficulty in so many ways as arjuna also was in difficulty in having to fight the battle copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved of kuruketra arjuna surrendered unto r ka and consequently this bhagavadgt was spoken not only arjuna but every one of us is full of anxieties because of this material existence our very existence is in the atmosphere of nonexistence actually we are not meant to be threatened by nonexistence our existence is eternal but somehow or other we are put into asat asat refers to that which does not exist out of so many human beings who are suffering there are a few who are actually inquiring about their position as to what they are why they are put into this awkward position and so on unless one is awakened to this position of questioning his suffering unless he realizes that he doesnt want suffering but rather wants to make a solution to all suffering then one is not to be considered a perfect human being humanity begins when this sort of inquiry is awakened in ones mind in the brahmastra this inquiry is called brahma jijs athto brahma jijs every activity of the human being is to be considered a failure unless he inquires about the nature of the absolute therefore those who begin to question why they are suffering or where they came from and where they shall go after death are proper students for understanding bhagavadgt the sincere student should also have a firm respect for the supreme personality of godhead such a student was arjuna lord ka descends specifically to reestablish the real purpose of life when man forgets that purpose even then out of many many human beings who awaken there may be one who actually enters the spirit of understanding his position and for him this bhagavadgt is spoken actually we are all swallowed by the tigress of nescience but the lord is very merciful upon living entities especially human beings to this end he spoke the bhagavadgt making his friend arjuna his student being an associate of lord ka arjuna was above all ignorance but arjuna was put into ignorance on the battlefield of kuruketra just to question lord ka about the problems of life so that the lord could explain them for the benefit of future generations of human beings and chalk out the plan of life then man could act accordingly and perfect the mission of human life the subject of the bhagavadgt entails the comprehension of five basic copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved truths first of all the science of god is explained and then the constitutional position of the living entities jvas there is vara which means the controller and there are jvas the living entities which are controlled if a living entity says that he is not controlled but that he is free then he is insane the living being is controlled in every respect at least in his conditioned life so in the bhagavadgt the subject matter deals with the vara the supreme controller and the jvas the controlled living entities prakti material nature and time the duration of existence of the whole universe or the manifestation of material nature and karma activity are also discussed the cosmic manifestation is full of different activities all living entities are engaged in different activities from bhagavadgt we must learn what god is what the living entities are what prakti is what the cosmic manifestation is how it is controlled by time and what the activities of the living entities are out of these five basic subject matters in bhagavadgt it is established that the supreme godhead or ka or brahman or the supreme controller or paramtmyou may use whatever name you likeis the greatest of all the living beings are in quality like the supreme controller for instance the lord has control over the universal affairs of material nature as will be explained in the later chapters of bhagavadgt material nature is not independent she is acting under the directions of the supreme lord as lord ka says maydhyakea prakti syate sacarcaram this material nature is working under my direction when we see wonderful things happening in the cosmic nature we should know that behind this cosmic manifestation there is a controller nothing could be manifested without being controlled it is childish not to consider the controller for instance a child may think that an automobile is quite wonderful to be able to run without a horse or other animal pulling it but a sane man knows the nature of the automobiles engineering arrangement he always knows that behind the machinery there is a man a driver similarly the supreme lord is the driver under whose direction everything is working now the jvas or the living entities have been accepted by the lord as we will note in the later chapters as his parts and parcels a particle of gold is also gold a drop of water from the ocean is also salty and similarly we the living entities being part and parcel of the supreme copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved controller vara or bhagavn lord r ka have all the qualities of the supreme lord in minute quantity because we are minute varas subordinate varas we are trying to control nature as presently we are trying to control space or planets and this tendency to control is there because it is in ka but although we have a tendency to lord it over material nature we should know that we are not the supreme controller this is explained in bhagavadgt what is material nature this is also explained in gt as inferior prakti inferior nature the living entity is explained as the superior prakti prakti is always under control whether inferior or superior prakti is female and she is controlled by the lord just as the activities of a wife are controlled by the husband prakti is always subordinate predominated by the lord who is the predominator the living entities and material nature are both predominated controlled by the supreme lord according to the gt the living entities although parts and parcels of the supreme lord are to be considered prakti this is clearly mentioned in the seventh chapter of bhagavadgt apareyam itas tv any prakti viddhi me parm jvabhtm this material nature is my inferior prakti but beyond this is another praktijvabhtm the living entity material nature itself is constituted by three qualities the mode of goodness the mode of passion and the mode of ignorance above these modes there is eternal time and by a combination of these modes of nature and under the control and purview of eternal time there are activities which are called karma these activities are being carried out from time immemorial and we are suffering or enjoying the fruits of our activities for instance suppose i am a businessman and have worked very hard with intelligence and have amassed a great bank balance then i am an enjoyer but then say i have lost all my money in business then i am a sufferer similarly in every field of life we enjoy the results of our work or we suffer the results this is called karma vara the supreme lord jva the living entity prakti nature kla eternal time and karma activity are all explained in the bhagavadgt out of these five the lord the living entities material nature and time are eternal the manifestation of prakti may be temporary but it is not false some copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved philosophers say that the manifestation of material nature is false but according to the philosophy of bhagavadgt or according to the philosophy of the vaiavas this is not so the manifestation of the world is not accepted as false it is accepted as real but temporary it is likened unto a cloud which moves across the sky or the coming of the rainy season which nourishes grains as soon as the rainy season is over and as soon as the cloud goes away all the crops which were nourished by the rain dry up similarly this material manifestation takes place at a certain interval stays for a while and then disappears such are the workings of prakti but this cycle is working eternally therefore prakti is eternal it is not false the lord refers to this as my prakti this material nature is the separated energy of the supreme lord and similarly the living entities are also the energy of the supreme lord although they are not separated but eternally related so the lord the living entity material nature and time are all interrelated and are all eternal however the other item karma is not eternal the effects of karma may be very old indeed we are suffering or enjoying the results of our activities from time immemorial but we can change the results of our karma or our activity and this change depends on the perfection of our knowledge we are engaged in various activities undoubtedly we do not know what sort of activities we should adopt to gain relief from the actions and reactions of all these activities but this is also explained in the bhagavadgt the position of vara the supreme lord is that of supreme consciousness the jvas or the living entities being parts and parcels of the supreme lord are also conscious both the living entity and material nature are explained as prakti the energy of the supreme lord but one of the two the jva is conscious the other prakti is not conscious that is the difference therefore the jvaprakti is called superior because the jva has consciousness which is similar to the lords the lords is supreme consciousness however and one should not claim that the jva the living entity is also supremely conscious the living being cannot be supremely conscious at any stage of his perfection and the theory that he can be so is a misleading theory conscious he may be but he is not perfectly or supremely conscious the distinction between the jva and the vara will be explained in the copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved thirteenth chapter of bhagavadgt the lord is ketraja conscious as is the living being but the living being is conscious of his particular body whereas the lord is conscious of all bodies because he lives in the heart of every living being he is conscious of the psychic movements of the particular jvas we should not forget this it is also explained that the paramtm the supreme personality of godhead is living in everyones heart as vara as the controller and that he is giving directions for the living entity to act as he desires the living entity forgets what to do first of all he makes a determination to act in a certain way and then he is entangled in the actions and reactions of his own karma after giving up one type of body he enters another type of body as we put on and take off clothes as the soul thus migrates he suffers the actions and reactions of his past activities these activities can be changed when the living being is in the mode of goodness in sanity and understands what sort of activities he should adopt if he does so then all the actions and reactions of his past activities can be changed consequently karma is not eternal therefore we stated that of the five items vara jva prakti time and karma four are eternal whereas karma is not eternal the supreme conscious vara is similar to the living entity in this way both the consciousness of the lord and that of the living entity are transcendental it is not that consciousness is generated by the association of matter that is a mistaken idea the theory that consciousness develops under certain circumstances of material combination is not accepted in the bhagavadgt consciousness may be pervertedly reflected by the covering of material circumstances just as light reflected through colored glass may appear to be a certain color but the consciousness of the lord is not materially affected lord ka says maydhyakea prakti bg 910 when he descends into the material universe his consciousness is not materially affected if he were so affected he would be unfit to speak on transcendental matters as he does in the bhagavadgt one cannot say anything about the transcendental world without being free from materially contaminated consciousness so the lord is not materially contaminated our consciousness at the present moment however is materially contaminated the bhagavadgt teaches that we have copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved to purify this materially contaminated consciousness in pure consciousness our actions will be dovetailed to the will of vara and that will make us happy it is not that we have to cease all activities rather our activities are to be purified and purified activities are called bhakti activities in bhakti appear to be like ordinary activities but they are not contaminated an ignorant person may see that a devotee is acting or working like an ordinary man but such a person with a poor fund of knowledge does not know that the activities of the devotee or of the lord are not contaminated by impure consciousness or matter they are transcendental to the three modes of nature we should know however that at this point our consciousness is contaminated when we are materially contaminated we are called conditioned false consciousness is exhibited under the impression that i am a product of material nature this is called false ego one who is absorbed in the thought of bodily conceptions cannot understand his situation bhagavadgt was spoken to liberate one from the bodily conception of life and arjuna put himself in this position in order to receive this information from the lord one must become free from the bodily conception of life that is the preliminary activity for the transcendentalist one who wants to become free who wants to become liberated must first of all learn that he is not this material body mukti or liberation means freedom from material consciousness in the rmadbhgavatam also the definition of liberation is given muktir hitvnyathrpa svarpea vyavasthiti mukti means liberation from the contaminated consciousness of this material world and situation in pure consciousness all the instructions of bhagavadgt are intended to awaken this pure consciousness and therefore we find at the last stage of the gts instructions that ka is asking arjuna whether he is now in purified consciousness purified consciousness means acting in accordance with the instructions of the lord this is the whole sum and substance of purified consciousness consciousness is already there because we are part and parcel of the lord but for us there is the affinity of being affected by the inferior modes but the lord being the supreme is never affected that is the difference between the supreme lord and the small individual souls what is this consciousness this consciousness is i am then what am i copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved in contaminated consciousness i am means i am the lord of all i survey i am the enjoyer the world revolves because every living being thinks that he is the lord and creator of the material world material consciousness has two psychic divisions one is that i am the creator and the other is that i am the enjoyer but actually the supreme lord is both the creator and the enjoyer and the living entity being part and parcel of the supreme lord is neither the creator nor the enjoyer but a cooperator he is the created and the enjoyed for instance a part of a machine cooperates with the whole machine a part of the body cooperates with the whole body the hands legs eyes and so on are all parts of the body but they are not actually the enjoyers the stomach is the enjoyer the legs move the hands supply food the teeth chew and all parts of the body are engaged in satisfying the stomach because the stomach is the principal factor that nourishes the bodys organization therefore everything is given to the stomach one nourishes the tree by watering its root and one nourishes the body by feeding the stomach for if the body is to be kept in a healthy state then the parts of the body must cooperate to feed the stomach similarly the supreme lord is the enjoyer and the creator and we as subordinate living beings are meant to cooperate to satisfy him this cooperation will actually help us just as food taken by the stomach will help all other parts of the body if the fingers of the hand think that they should take the food themselves instead of giving it to the stomach then they will be frustrated the central figure of creation and of enjoyment is the supreme lord and the living entities are cooperators by cooperation they enjoy the relation is also like that of the master and the servant if the master is fully satisfied then the servant is satisfied similarly the supreme lord should be satisfied although the tendency to become the creator and the tendency to enjoy the material world are there also in the living entities because these tendencies are there in the supreme lord who has created the manifested cosmic world we shall find therefore in this bhagavadgt that the complete whole is comprised of the supreme controller the controlled living entities the cosmic manifestation eternal time and karma or activities and all of these are explained in this text all of these taken completely form the complete whole copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved and the complete whole is called the supreme absolute truth the complete whole and the complete absolute truth are the complete personality of godhead r ka all manifestations are due to his different energies he is the complete whole it is also explained in the gt that impersonal brahman is also subordinate to the complete supreme person brahmao hi pratihham brahman is more explicitly explained in the brahmastra to be like the rays of the sunshine the impersonal brahman is the shining rays of the supreme personality of godhead impersonal brahman is incomplete realization of the absolute whole and so also is the conception of paramtm in the fifteenth chapter it shall be seen that the supreme personality of godhead puruottama is above both impersonal brahman and the partial realization of paramtm the supreme personality of godhead is called saccidnandavigraha the brahmasahit begins in this way vara parama ka saccidnandavigraha andir dir govinda sarvakraakraam govinda ka is the cause of all causes he is the primal cause and he is the very form of eternity knowledge and bliss impersonal brahman realization is the realization of his sat eternity feature paramtm realization is the realization of satcit eternal knowledge but realization of the personality of godhead ka is realization of all the transcendental features sat cit and nanda eternity knowledge and bliss in complete vigraha form people with less intelligence consider the supreme truth to be impersonal but he is a transcendental person and this is confirmed in all vedic literatures nityo nityn cetana cetannm kaha upaniad 2213 as we are all individual living beings and have our individuality the supreme absolute truth is also in the ultimate issue a person and realization of the personality of godhead is realization of all of the transcendental features in his complete form the complete whole is not formless if he is formless or if he is less than any other thing then he cannot be the complete whole the complete whole must have everything within our experience and beyond our experience otherwise it cannot be complete the complete whole personality of godhead has immense potencies parsya aktir vividhaiva ryate how ka is acting in different potencies is copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved also explained in bhagavadgt this phenomenal world or material world in which we are placed is also complete in itself because the twentyfour elements of which this material universe is a temporary manifestation according to skhya philosophy are completely adjusted to produce complete resources which are necessary for the maintenance and subsistence of this universe there is nothing extraneous nor is there anything needed this manifestation has its own time fixed by the energy of the supreme whole and when its time is complete these temporary manifestations will be annihilated by the complete arrangement of the complete there is complete facility for the small complete units namely the living entities to realize the complete and all sorts of incompleteness are experienced due to incomplete knowledge of the complete so bhagavadgt contains the complete knowledge of vedic wisdom all vedic knowledge is infallible and hindus accept vedic knowledge to be complete and infallible for example cow dung is the stool of an animal and according to smti or vedic injunction if one touches the stool of an animal he has to take a bath to purify himself but in the vedic scriptures cow dung is considered to be a purifying agent one might consider this to be contradictory but it is accepted because it is vedic injunction and indeed by accepting this one will not commit a mistake subsequently it has been proved by modern science that cow dung contains all antiseptic properties so vedic knowledge is complete because it is above all doubts and mistakes and bhagavadgt is the essence of all vedic knowledge vedic knowledge is not a question of research our research work is imperfect because we are researching things with imperfect senses we have to accept perfect knowledge which comes down as is stated in bhagavadgt by the parampar disciplic succession we have to receive knowledge from the proper source in disciplic succession beginning with the supreme spiritual master the lord himself and handed down to a succession of spiritual masters arjuna the student who took lessons from lord r ka accepts everything that he says without contradicting him one is not allowed to accept one portion of bhagavadgt and not another no we must accept bhagavadgt without interpretation without deletion and without our own whimsical participation in the matter the gt should be taken as the most copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved perfect presentation of vedic knowledge vedic knowledge is received from transcendental sources and the first words were spoken by the lord himself the words spoken by the lord are called apaurueya meaning that they are different from words spoken by a person of the mundane world who is infected with four defects a mundaner 1 is sure to commit mistakes 2 is invariably illusioned 3 has the tendency to cheat others and 4 is limited by imperfect senses with these four imperfections one cannot deliver perfect information of allpervading knowledge vedic knowledge is not imparted by such defective living entities it was imparted unto the heart of brahm the first created living being and brahm in his turn disseminated this knowledge to his sons and disciples as he originally received it from the lord the lord is pram allperfect and there is no possibility of his becoming subjected to the laws of material nature one should therefore be intelligent enough to know that the lord is the only proprietor of everything in the universe and that he is the original creator the creator of brahm in the eleventh chapter the lord is addressed as prapitmaha bg 1139 because brahm is addressed as pitmaha the grandfather and he is the creator of the grandfather so no one should claim to be the proprietor of anything one should accept only things which are set aside for him by the lord as his quota for his maintenance there are many examples given of how we are to utilize those things which are set aside for us by the lord this is also explained in bhagavadgt in the beginning arjuna decided that he should not fight in the battle of kuruketra this was his own decision arjuna told the lord that it was not possible for him to enjoy the kingdom after killing his own kinsmen this decision was based on the body because he was thinking that the body was himself and that his bodily relations or expansions were his brothers nephews brothersinlaw grandfathers and so on therefore he wanted to satisfy his bodily demands bhagavadgt was spoken by the lord just to change this view and at the end arjuna decides to fight under the directions of the lord when he says kariye vacana tava bg 1873 i shall act according to your word in this world men are not meant for quarreling like cats and dogs men copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved must be intelligent to realize the importance of human life and refuse to act like ordinary animals a human being should realize the aim of his life and this direction is given in all vedic literatures and the essence is given in bhagavadgt vedic literature is meant for human beings not for animals animals can kill other living animals and there is no question of sin on their part but if a man kills an animal for the satisfaction of his uncontrolled taste he must be responsible for breaking the laws of nature in the bhagavadgt it is clearly explained that there are three kinds of activities according to the different modes of nature the activities of goodness of passion and of ignorance similarly there are three kinds of eatables also eatables in goodness passion and ignorance all of this is clearly described and if we properly utilize the instructions of bhagavadgt then our whole life will become purified and ultimately we will be able to reach the destination which is beyond this material sky bg 156 that destination is called the santana sky the eternal spiritual sky in this material world we find that everything is temporary it comes into being stays for some time produces some byproducts dwindles and then vanishes that is the law of the material world whether we use as an example this body or a piece of fruit or anything but beyond this temporary world there is another world of which we have information that world consists of another nature which is santana eternal jva is also described as santana eternal and the lord is also described as santana in the eleventh chapter we have an intimate relationship with the lord and because we are all qualitatively onethe santanadhma or sky the santana supreme personality and the santana living entitiesthe whole purpose of bhagavadgt is to revive our santana occupation or santanadharma which is the eternal occupation of the living entity we are temporarily engaged in different activities but all of these activities can be purified when we give up all these temporary activities and take up the activities which are prescribed by the supreme lord that is called our pure life the supreme lord and his transcendental abode are both santana as are the living entities and the combined association of the supreme lord and the living entities in the santana abode is the perfection of human life the lord copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved is very kind to the living entities because they are his sons lord ka declares in bhagavadgt sarvayoniu aha bjaprada pit i am the father of all of course there are all types of living entities according to their various karmas but here the lord claims that he is the father of all of them therefore the lord descends to reclaim all of these fallen conditioned souls to call them back to the santana eternal sky so that the santana living entities may regain their eternal santana positions in eternal association with the lord the lord comes himself in different incarnations or he sends his confidential servants as sons or his associates or cryas to reclaim the conditioned souls therefore santanadharma does not refer to any sectarian process of religion it is the eternal function of the eternal living entities in relationship with the eternal supreme lord santanadharma refers as stated previously to the eternal occupation of the living entity rpda rmnujcrya has explained the word santana as that which has neither beginning nor end so when we speak of santanadharma we must take it for granted on the authority of rpda rmnujcrya that it has neither beginning nor end the english world religion is a little different from santanadharma religion conveys the idea of faith and faith may change one may have faith in a particular process and he may change this faith and adopt another but santanadharma refers to that activity which cannot be changed for instance liquidity cannot be taken from water nor can heat be taken from fire similarly the eternal function of the eternal living entity cannot be taken from the living entity santanadharma is eternally integral with the living entity when we speak of santanadharma therefore we must take it for granted on the authority of rpda rmnujcrya that it has neither beginning nor end that which has neither end nor beginning must not be sectarian for it cannot be limited by any boundaries those belonging to some sectarian faith will wrongly consider that santanadharma is also sectarian but if we go deeply into the matter and consider it in the light of modern science it is possible for us to see that santanadharma is the business of all the people of the worldnay of all the living entities of the universe nonsantana religious faith may have some beginning in the annals of copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved human history but there is no beginning to the history of santanadharma because it remains eternally with the living entities insofar as the living entities are concerned the authoritative stras state that the living entity has neither birth nor death in the gt it is stated that the living entity is never born and he never dies he is eternal and indestructible and he continues to live after the destruction of his temporary material body in reference to the concept of santanadharma we must try to understand the concept of religion from the sanskrit root meaning of the word dharma refers to that which is constantly existing with a particular object we conclude that there is heat and light along with the fire without heat and light there is no meaning to the word fire similarly we must discover the essential part of the living being that part which is his constant companion that constant companion is his eternal quality and that eternal quality is his eternal religion when santana gosvm asked r caitanya mahprabhu about the svarpa of every living being the lord replied that the svarpa or constitutional position of the living being is the rendering of service to the supreme personality of godhead if we analyze this statement of lord caitanyas we can easily see that every living being is constantly engaged in rendering service to another living being a living being serves other living beings in various capacities by doing so the living entity enjoys life the lower animals serve human beings as servants serve their master a serves b master b serves c master and c serves d master and so on under these circumstances we can see that one friend serves another friend the mother serves the son the wife serves the husband the husband serves the wife and so on if we go on searching in this spirit it will be seen that there is no exception in the society of living beings to the activity of service the politician presents his manifesto for the public to convince them of his capacity for service the voters therefore give the politician their valuable votes thinking that he will render valuable service to society the shopkeeper serves the customer and the artisan serves the capitalist the capitalist serves the family and the family serves the state in the terms of the eternal capacity of the eternal living being in this way we can see that no living being is exempt from rendering service to other living beings and therefore we can safely conclude that service is the copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved constant companion of the living being and that the rendering of service is the eternal religion of the living being yet man professes to belong to a particular type of faith with reference to particular time and circumstance and thus claims to be a hindu muslim christian buddhist or an adherent of any other sect such designations are nonsantanadharma a hindu may change his faith to become a muslim or a muslim may change his faith to become a hindu or a christian may change his faith and so on but in all circumstances the change of religious faith does not affect the eternal occupation of rendering service to others the hindu muslim or christian in all circumstances is servant of someone thus to profess a particular type of faith is not to profess ones santanadharma the rendering of service is santanadharma factually we are related to the supreme lord in service the supreme lord is the supreme enjoyer and we living entities are his servitors we are created for his enjoyment and if we participate in that eternal enjoyment with the supreme personality of godhead we become happy we cannot become happy otherwise it is not possible to be happy independently just as no one part of the body can be happy without cooperating with the stomach it is not possible for the living entity to be happy without rendering transcendental loving service unto the supreme lord in the bhagavadgt worship of different demigods or rendering service to them is not approved it is stated in the seventh chapter twentieth verse kmais tais tair htajn prapadyante nyadevat ta ta niyamam sthya prakty niyat svay those whose intelligence has been stolen by material desires surrender unto demigods and follow the particular rules and regulations of worship according to their own natures here it is plainly said that those who are directed by lust worship the demigods and not the supreme lord ka when we mention the name ka we do not refer to any sectarian name ka means the highest pleasure and it is confirmed that the supreme lord is the copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved reservoir or storehouse of all pleasure we are all hankering after pleasure nandamayo bhyst vedntastra 1112 the living entities like the lord are full of consciousness and they are after happiness the lord is perpetually happy and if the living entities associate with the lord cooperate with him and take part in his association then they also become happy the lord descends to this mortal world to show his pastimes in vndvana which are full of happiness when lord r ka was in vndvana his activities with his cowherd boyfriends with his damsel friends with the other inhabitants of vndvana and with the cows were all full of happiness the total population of vndvana knew nothing but ka but lord ka even discouraged his father nanda mahrja from worshiping the demigod indra because he wanted to establish the fact that people need not worship any demigod they need only worship the supreme lord because their ultimate goal is to return to his abode the abode of lord r ka is described in the bhagavadgt fifteenth chapter sixth verse na tad bhsayate sryo na ako na pvaka yad gatv na nivartante tad dhma parama mama that supreme abode of mine is not illumined by the sun or moon nor by fire or electricity those who reach it never return to this material world this verse gives a description of that eternal sky of course we have a material conception of the sky and we think of it in relationship to the sun moon stars and so on but in this verse the lord states that in the eternal sky there is no need for the sun nor for the moon nor electricity or fire of any kind because the spiritual sky is already illuminated by the brahmajyoti the rays emanating from the supreme lord we are trying with difficulty to reach other planets but it is not difficult to understand the abode of the supreme lord this abode is referred to as goloka in the brahmasahit 537 it is beautifully described goloka eva nivasaty akhiltmabhta the lord resides eternally in his abode goloka yet he can be approached from this world and copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved to this end the lord comes to manifest his real form saccidnandavigraha bs 51 when he manifests this form there is no need for our imagining what he looks like to discourage such imaginative speculation he descends and exhibits himself as he is as ymasundara unfortunately the less intelligent deride him because he comes as one of us and plays with us as a human being but because of this we should not consider the lord one of us it is by his omnipotency that he presents himself in his real form before us and displays his pastimes which are replicas of those pastimes found in his abode in the effulgent rays of the spiritual sky there are innumerable planets floating the brahmajyoti emanates from the supreme abode kaloka and the nandamaya cinmaya planets which are not material float in those rays the lord says na tad bhsayate sryo na ako na pvaka yad gatv na nivartante tad dhma parama mama bg 156 one who can approach that spiritual sky is not required to descend again to the material sky in the material sky even if we approach the highest planet brahmaloka what to speak of the moon we will find the same conditions of life namely birth death disease and old age no planet in the material universe is free from these four principles of material existence the living entities are traveling from one planet to another but it is not that we can go to any planet we like merely by a mechanical arrangement if we desire to go to other planets there is a process for going there this is also mentioned ynti devavrat devn pitn ynti pitvrat bg 925 no mechanical arrangement is necessary if we want interplanetary travel the gt instructs ynti devavrat devn the moon the sun and higher planets are called svargaloka there are three different statuses of planets higher middle and lower planetary systems the earth belongs to the middle planetary system bhagavadgt informs us how to travel to the higher planetary systems devaloka with a very simple formula ynti devavrat devn one need only worship the particular demigod of that particular planet and in that way go to the moon the sun or any of the higher planetary systems yet bhagavadgt does not advise us to go to any of the planets in this material world because even if we go to brahmaloka the highest planet through some sort of mechanical contrivance by maybe traveling for forty copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved thousand years and who would live that long we will still find the material inconveniences of birth death disease and old age but one who wants to approach the supreme planet kaloka or any of the other planets within the spiritual sky will not meet with these material inconveniences amongst all of the planets in the spiritual sky there is one supreme planet called goloka vndvana which is the original planet in the abode of the original personality of godhead r ka all of this information is given in bhagavadgt and we are given through its instruction information how to leave the material world and begin a truly blissful life in the spiritual sky in the fifteenth chapter of the bhagavadgt the real picture of the material world is given it is said there rdhvamlam adhakham avattha prhur avyayam chandsi yasya parni yas ta veda sa vedavit here the material world is described as a tree whose roots are upwards and branches are below we have experience of a tree whose roots are upward if one stands on the bank of a river or any reservoir of water he can see that the trees reflected in the water are upside down the branches go downward and the roots upward similarly this material world is a reflection of the spiritual world the material world is but a shadow of reality in the shadow there is no reality or substantiality but from the shadow we can understand that there are substance and reality in the desert there is no water but the mirage suggests that there is such a thing as water in the material world there is no water there is no happiness but the real water of actual happiness is there in the spiritual world the lord suggests that we attain the spiritual world in the following manner bg 155 nirmnamoh jitasagado adhytmanity vinivttakm dvandvair vimukt sukhadukhasajair gacchanty amh padam avyaya tat copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved that padam avyayam or eternal kingdom can be reached by one who is nirmnamoha what does this mean we are after designations someone wants to become sir someone wants to become lord someone wants to become the president or a rich man or a king or something else as long as we are attached to these designations we are attached to the body because designations belong to the body but we are not these bodies and realizing this is the first stage in spiritual realization we are associated with the three modes of material nature but we must become detached through devotional service to the lord if we are not attached to devotional service to the lord then we cannot become detached from the modes of material nature designations and attachments are due to our lust and desire our wanting to lord it over the material nature as long as we do not give up this propensity of lording it over material nature there is no possibility of returning to the kingdom of the supreme the santanadhma that eternal kingdom which is never destroyed can be approached by one who is not bewildered by the attractions of false material enjoyments who is situated in the service of the supreme lord one so situated can easily approach that supreme abode elsewhere in the gt 821 it is stated avyakto kara ity uktas tam hu param gatim ya prpya na nivartante tad dhma parama mama avyakta means unmanifested not even all of the material world is manifested before us our senses are so imperfect that we cannot even see all of the stars within this material universe in vedic literature we can receive much information about all the planets and we can believe it or not believe it all of the important planets are described in vedic literatures especially rmadbhgavatam and the spiritual world which is beyond this material sky is described as avyakta unmanifested one should desire and hanker after that supreme kingdom for when one attains that kingdom he does not have to return to this material world next one may raise the question of how one goes about approaching that copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved abode of the supreme lord information of this is given in the eighth chapter it is said there antakle ca mm eva smaran muktv kalevaram ya prayti sa madbhva yti nsty atra saaya anyone who quits his body at the end of life remembering me attains immediately to my nature and there is no doubt of this bg 85 one who thinks of ka at the time of his death goes to ka one must remember the form of ka if he quits his body thinking of this form he surely approaches the spiritual kingdom madbhvam refers to the supreme nature of the supreme being the supreme being is saccidnandavigraha bs 51that is his form is eternal full of knowledge and bliss our present body is not saccidnanda it is asat not sat it is not eternal it is perishable it is not cit full of knowledge but it is full of ignorance we have no knowledge of the spiritual kingdom nor do we even have perfect knowledge of this material world where there are so many things unknown to us the body is also nirnanda instead of being full of bliss it is full of misery all of the miseries we experience in the material world arise from the body but one who leaves this body thinking of lord ka the supreme personality of godhead at once attains a saccidnanda body the process of quitting this body and getting another body in the material world is also organized a man dies after it has been decided what form of body he will have in the next life higher authorities not the living entity himself make this decision according to our activities in this life we either rise or sink this life is a preparation for the next life if we can prepare therefore in this life to get promotion to the kingdom of god then surely after quitting this material body we will attain a spiritual body just like the lords as explained before there are different kinds of transcendentaliststhe brahmavd paramtmavd and the devoteeand as mentioned in the brahmajyoti spiritual sky there are innumerable spiritual planets the number of these planets is far far greater than all of the planets of this copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved material world this material world has been approximated as only one quarter of the creation ekena sthito jagat in this material segment there are millions and billions of universes with trillions of planets and suns stars and moons but this whole material creation is only a fragment of the total creation most of the creation is in the spiritual sky one who desires to merge into the existence of the supreme brahman is at once transferred to the brahmajyoti of the supreme lord and thus attains the spiritual sky the devotee who wants to enjoy the association of the lord enters into the vaikuha planets which are innumerable and the supreme lord by his plenary expansions as nryaa with four hands and with different names like pradyumna aniruddha and govinda associates with him there therefore at the end of life the transcendentalists think either of the brahmajyoti the paramtm or supreme personality of godhead r ka in all cases they enter into the spiritual sky but only the devotee or he who is in personal touch with the supreme lord enters into the vaikuha planets or the goloka vndvana planet the lord further adds that of this there is no doubt this must be believed firmly we should not reject that which does not tally with our imagination our attitude should be that of arjuna i believe everything that you have said therefore when the lord says that at the time of death whoever thinks of him as brahman or paramtm or as the personality of godhead certainly enters into the spiritual sky there is no doubt about it there is no question of disbelieving it the bhagavadgt 86 also explains the general principle that makes it possible to enter the spiritual kingdom simply by thinking of the supreme at the time of death ya ya vpi smaran bhva tyajaty ante kalevaram ta tam evaiti kaunteya sad tadbhvabhvita whatever state of being one remembers when he quits his present body in his next life he will attain to that state without fail now first we must understand that material nature is a display of one of the energies of the copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved supreme lord in the viu pura 6761 the total energies of the supreme lord are delineated viuakti par prokt ketrajkhy tath par avidykarmasajny tty aktir iyate cc madhya 6154 the supreme lord has diverse and innumerable energies which are beyond our conception however great learned sages or liberated souls have studied these energies and have analyzed them into three parts all of the energies are of viuakti that is to say they are different potencies of lord viu the first energy is par transcendental living entities also belong to the superior energy as has already been explained the other energies or material energies are in the mode of ignorance at the time of death either we can remain in the inferior energy of this material world or we can transfer to the energy of the spiritual world so the bhagavadgt 86 says ya ya vpi smaran bhva tyajaty ante kalevaram ta tam evaiti kaunteya sad tadbhvabhvita whatever state of being one remembers when he quits his present body in his next life he will attain to that state without fail in life we are accustomed to thinking either of the material or of the spiritual energy now how can we transfer our thoughts from the material energy to the spiritual energy there are so many literatures which fill our thoughts with the material energynewspapers magazines novels etc our thinking which is now absorbed in these literatures must be transferred to the vedic literatures the great sages therefore have written so many vedic literatures such as the puras the puras are not imaginative they are historical records in the caitanyacaritmta madhya 20122 there is the following verse copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved mymugdha jvera nhi svata kajna jvere kpya kail ka vedapura the forgetful living entities or conditioned souls have forgotten their relationship with the supreme lord and they are engrossed in thinking of material activities just to transfer their thinking power to the spiritual sky kadvaipyana vysa has given a great number of vedic literatures first he divided the vedas into four then he explained them in the puras and for less capable people he wrote the mahbhrata in the mahbhrata there is given the bhagavadgt then all vedic literature is summarized in the vedntastra and for future guidance he gave a natural commentation on the vedntastra called rmadbhgavatam we must always engage our minds in reading these vedic literatures just as materialists engage their minds in reading newspapers magazines and so many materialistic literatures we must transfer our reading to these literatures which are given to us by vysadeva in that way it will be possible for us to remember the supreme lord at the time of death that is the only way suggested by the lord and he guarantees the result there is no doubt tasmt sarveu kleu mm anusmara yudhya ca mayy arpitamanobuddhir mm evaiyasy asaaya therefore arjuna you should always think of me in the form of ka and at the same time continue your prescribed duty of fighting with your activities dedicated to me and your mind and intelligence fixed on me you will attain me without doubt bg 87 he does not advise arjuna simply to remember him and give up his occupation no the lord never suggests anything impractical in this material world in order to maintain the body one has to work human society is divided according to work into four divisions of social orderbrhmaa katriya vaiya and dra the brhmaa class or intelligent class is working in one way the katriya or administrative class is working in another way and copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved the mercantile class and the laborers are all tending to their specific duties in the human society whether one is a laborer merchant administrator or farmer or even if one belongs to the highest class and is a literary man a scientist or a theologian he has to work in order to maintain his existence the lord therefore tells arjuna that he need not give up his occupation but while he is engaged in his occupation he should remember ka mm anusmara bg 87 if he doesnt practice remembering ka while he is struggling for existence then it will not be possible for him to remember ka at the time of death lord caitanya also advises this he says krtanya sad hari cc adi 1731 one should practice chanting the names of the lord always the names of the lord and the lord are nondifferent so lord kas instructions to arjuna to remember me and lord caitanyas injunction to always chant the names of lord ka are the same instruction there is no difference because ka and kas name are nondifferent in the absolute status there is no difference between reference and referrent therefore we have to practice remembering the lord always twentyfour hours a day by chanting his names and molding our lifes activities in such a way that we can remember him always how is this possible the cryas give the following example if a married woman is attached to another man or if a man has an attachment for a woman other than his wife then the attachment is to be considered very strong one with such an attachment is always thinking of the loved one the wife who is thinking of her lover is always thinking of meeting him even while she is carrying out her household chores in fact she carries out her household work even more carefully so her husband will not suspect her attachment similarly we should always remember the supreme lover r ka and at the same time perform our material duties very nicely a strong sense of love is required here if we have a strong sense of love for the supreme lord then we can discharge our duty and at the same time remember him but we have to develop that sense of love arjuna for instance was always thinking of ka he was the constant companion of ka and at the same time he was a warrior ka did not advise him to give up fighting and go to the forest to meditate when lord ka delineates the yoga system to arjuna arjuna says that the practice copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved of this system is not possible for him arjuna uvca yo ya yogas tvay prokta smyena madhusdana etasyha na paymi cacalatvt sthiti sthirm arjuna said o madhusdana the system of yoga which you have summarized appears impractical and unendurable to me for the mind is restless and unsteady bg 633 but the lord says yoginm api sarve madgatenntartman raddhvn bhajate yo m sa me yuktatamo mata of all yogs the one with great faith who always abides in me thinks of me within himself and renders transcendental loving service to me is the most intimately united with me in yoga and is the highest of all that is my opinion bg 647 so one who thinks of the supreme lord always is the greatest yog the supermost jn and the greatest devotee at the same time the lord further tells arjuna that as a katriya he cannot give up his fighting but if arjuna fights remembering ka then he will be able to remember ka at the time of death but one must be completely surrendered in the transcendental loving service of the lord we work not with our body actually but with our mind and intelligence so if the intelligence and the mind are always engaged in the thought of the supreme lord then naturally the senses are also engaged in his service superficially at least the activities of the senses remain the same but the consciousness is changed the bhagavadgt teaches one how to absorb the mind and intelligence in the thought of the lord such absorption will enable one to transfer himself to the kingdom of the lord if the mind is engaged in kas service then the senses are automatically engaged in his service this copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved is the art and this is also the secret of bhagavadgt total absorption in the thought of r ka modern man has struggled very hard to reach the moon but he has not tried very hard to elevate himself spiritually if one has fifty years of life ahead of him he should engage that brief time in cultivating this practice of remembering the supreme personality of godhead this practice is the devotional process ravaa krtana vio smaraa pdasevanam arcana vandana dsya sakhyam tmanivedanam rmadbhgavatam 7523 these nine processes of which the easiest is ravaam hearing the bhagavadgt from the realized person will turn one to the thought of the supreme being this will lead to remembering the supreme lord and will enable one upon leaving the body to attain a spiritual body which is just fit for association with the supreme lord the lord further says abhysayogayuktena cetas nnyagmin parama purua divya yti prthnucintayan he who meditates on me as the supreme personality of godhead his mind constantly engaged in remembering me undeviated from the path he o arjuna is sure to reach me bg 88 this is not a very difficult process however one must learn it from an experienced person tad vijnrtha sa gurum evbhigacchet mu 12123 one must approach a person who is already in the practice the mind is always flying to this and that but one must practice concentrating the mind always on the form of the supreme lord r ka or on the sound of his name the mind is naturally restless going hither and thither but it can rest in the sound copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved vibration of ka one must thus meditate on parama puruam the supreme personality of godhead in the spiritual kingdom the spiritual sky and thus attain him the ways and the means for ultimate realization ultimate attainment are stated in the bhagavadgt and the doors of this knowledge are open for everyone no one is barred out all classes of men can approach lord ka by thinking of him for hearing and thinking of him is possible for everyone the lord further says bg 93233 m hi prtha vyapritya ye pi syu ppayonaya striyo vaiys tath drs te pi ynti par gatim ki punar brhma puy bhakt rjarayas tath anityam asukha lokam ima prpya bhajasva mm thus the lord says that even a merchant a fallen woman or a laborer or even human beings in the lowest status of life can attain the supreme one does not need highly developed intelligence the point is that anyone who accepts the principle of bhaktiyoga and accepts the supreme lord as the summum bonum of life as the highest target the ultimate goal can approach the lord in the spiritual sky if one adopts the principles enunciated in bhagavadgt he can make his life perfect and make a permanent solution to all the problems of life this is the sum and substance of the entire bhagavadgt in conclusion bhagavadgt is a transcendental literature which one should read very carefully gtstram ida puya ya pahet prayata pumn if one properly follows the instructions of

the help of a person who is a devotee of r ka and try to understand it without personally motivated interpretations the example of clear understanding is there in the bhagavadgt itself in the way the teaching is understood by arjuna who heard the gt directly from the lord if someone is fortunate enough to understand bhagavadgt in that line of disciplic succession without motivated interpretation then he surpasses all studies of vedic wisdom and all scriptures of the world one will find in the bhagavadgt all that is contained in other scriptures but the reader will also find things which are not to be found elsewhere that is the specific standard of the gt it is the perfect theistic science because it is directly spoken by the supreme personality of godhead lord r ka the topics discussed by dhtarra and sajaya as described in the mahbhrata form the basic principle for this great philosophy it is understood that this philosophy evolved on the battlefield of kuruketra which is a sacred place of pilgrimage from the immemorial time of the vedic age it was spoken by the lord when he was present personally on this planet for the guidance of mankind the word dharmaketra a place where religious rituals are performed is significant because on the battlefield of kuruketra the supreme personality of godhead was present on the side of arjuna dhtarra the father of the kurus was highly doubtful about the possibility of his sons ultimate victory in his doubt he inquired from his secretary sajaya what did they do he was confident that both his sons and the sons of his younger brother pu were assembled in that field of kuruketra for a determined engagement of the war still his inquiry is significant he did not want a compromise between the cousins and brothers and he wanted to be sure of the fate of his sons on the battlefield because the battle was arranged to be fought at kuruketra which is mentioned elsewhere in the vedas as a place of worshipeven for the denizens of heavendhtarra became very fearful about the influence of the holy place on the outcome of the battle he knew very well that this would copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved influence arjuna and the sons of pu favorably because by nature they were all virtuous sajaya was a student of vysa and therefore by the mercy of vysa sajaya was able to envision the battlefield of kuruketra even while he was in the room of dhtarra and so dhtarra asked him about the situation on the battlefield both the pavas and the sons of dhtarra belong to the same family but dhtarras mind is disclosed herein he deliberately claimed only his sons as kurus and he separated the sons of pu from the family heritage one can thus understand the specific position of dhtarra in his relationship with his nephews the sons of pu as in the paddy field the unnecessary plants are taken out so it is expected from the very beginning of these topics that in the religious field of kuruketra where the father of religion r ka was present the unwanted plants like dhtarras son duryodhana and others would be wiped out and the thoroughly religious persons headed by yudhihira would be established by the lord this is the significance of the words dharmaketre and kuruketre apart from their historical and vedic importance text 2 saya ovac da tau paavanaqk vyau duyaaerdanastada

especially think of his protection from all sides he might become engaged in the fight and the enemy might take advantage of his full engagement on one side therefore it was important that other heroes not leave their strategic positions and allow the enemy to break the phalanx duryodhana clearly felt that the victory of the kurus depended on the presence of bhmadeva he was confident of the

conchshells indicated that there was no hope of victory for the other side because ka was on the side of the pavas jayas tu puputr ye pake janrdana victory is always with persons like the sons of pu because lord ka is associated with them and whenever and wherever the lord is present the goddess of fortune is also there because the goddess of fortune never lives alone without her husband therefore victory and fortune were awaiting arjuna as indicated by the transcendental sound produced by the conchshell of viu or lord ka besides that the chariot on which both the friends were seated had been donated by agni the firegod to arjuna and this indicated that this chariot was capable of conquering all sides wherever it was drawn over the three worlds copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta

blew his the devadatta and bhma the voracious eater and performer of herculean tasks blew his terrific conchshell called paura purport lord ka is referred to as hkea in this verse because he is the owner of all senses the living entities are part and parcel of him and therefore the senses of the living entities are also part and parcel of his senses the impersonalists cannot account for the senses of the living entities and therefore they are always anxious to describe all living entities as senseless or impersonal the lord situated in the hearts of all living entities directs their senses but he directs in terms of the surrender of the living entity and in the copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved case of a pure devotee he directly controls the senses here on the battlefield of kuruketra the lord directly controls the transcendental senses of arjuna and thus his particular name of hkea the lord has different names according to his different activities for example his name is madhusdana because he killed the demon of the name madhu his name is govinda because he gives pleasure to the cows and to the senses his name is vsudeva because he appeared as the son of vasudeva his name is devaknandana because he accepted devak as his mother his name is yaodnandana because he awarded his childhood pastimes to yaod at vndvana his name is prthasrathi because he worked as charioteer of his friend arjuna similarly his name is hkea because he gave direction to arjuna on the battlefield of kuruketra arjuna is referred to as dhanajaya in this verse because he helped his elder brother in fetching wealth when it was required by the king to make expenditures for different sacrifices similarly bhma is known as vkodara because he could eat as voraciously as he could perform herculean tasks such as killing the demon hiimba so the particular types of conchshell blown by the different personalities on the side of the pavas beginning with the lords were all very encouraging to the fighting soldiers on the other side there were no such credits nor the presence of lord ka the supreme director nor that of the goddess of fortune so they were predestined to lose the battleand that was the message announced by the sounds of the conchshells texts 1618 anantaivjaya rajaa kuntaqpauaae yauidair nakul sahdev saugaaezmaiapauzpakae 16 kaxya

words purport the battle was just about to begin it is understood from the above statement that the sons of dhtarra were more or less disheartened by the unexpected arrangement of military force by the pavas who were guided by the direct instructions of lord ka on the battlefield the emblem of hanumn on the flag of arjuna is another sign of victory because hanumn cooperated with lord rma in the battle between rma and rvaa and lord rma emerged victorious now both rma and hanumn were present on the chariot of arjuna to help him lord ka is rma himself and wherever lord rma is his eternal servitor hanumn and his eternal consort st the goddess of fortune are present therefore arjuna had no cause to fear any enemies whatsoever and above all the lord of the senses lord ka was personally

lord ka is the supreme personality of godhead out of his causeless mercy he was engaged in the service of his friend he never fails in his affection for his devotees and thus he is addressed herein as infallible as charioteer he had to carry out the orders of arjuna and since he did not copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved hesitate to do so he is addressed as infallible although he had accepted the position of a charioteer for his devotee his supreme position was not challenged in all circumstances he is the supreme personality of godhead hkea the lord of the total senses the relationship between the lord and his servitor is very sweet and transcendental the servitor is always ready to render service to the lord and similarly the lord is always seeking an opportunity to render some service to the devotee he takes greater pleasure in his pure devotees assuming the advantageous position of ordering him than he does in being the giver of orders since he is master everyone is under his orders and no one is above him to order him but when he finds that a pure devotee is ordering him he obtains transcendental pleasure although he is the infallible master of all circumstances as a pure devotee of the lord arjuna had no desire to fight with his cousins and brothers but he was forced to come onto the battlefield by the obstinacy of duryodhana who was never agreeable to any peaceful negotiation therefore he was very anxious to see who the leading persons present on the battlefield were although there was no question of a peacemaking endeavor on

dhtarra therefore all persons who had joined the side of duryodhana must have been birds of the same feather arjuna wanted to see them on the battlefield before the fight was begun just to learn who they were but he had no intention of proposing peace negotiations with them it was also a fact that he wanted to see them to make an estimate of the strength which he had to face although he was quite

called gukea sleep also means ignorance so arjuna conquered both sleep and ignorance because of his friendship with ka as a great devotee of ka he could not forget ka even for a moment because that is the nature of a devotee either in waking or in sleep a devotee of the lord can never be free from thinking of kas name form qualities and pastimes thus a devotee of ka can conquer both sleep and

qualities which are found in godly persons or in the demigods whereas the nondevotee however advanced he may be in material qualifications by education and culture lacks in godly qualities as such arjuna just after seeing his kinsmen friends and relatives on the battlefield was at once overwhelmed by compassion for them who had so decided to fight amongst themselves as far as his soldiers were concerned he was sympathetic from the beginning but he felt compassion even for the soldiers of the opposite party foreseeing their imminent death and while he was so thinking the limbs of his body began to quiver and his mouth became dry he was more or less astonished to see their fighting spirit practically the whole community all blood relatives of arjuna had come to fight with him this overwhelmed a kind devotee like arjuna although it is not mentioned here still one can easily imagine that not only were arjunas bodily limbs quivering and his mouth drying up but he was also crying out of compassion such symptoms in arjuna were not due to weakness but to his softheartedness a characteristic of a pure devotee of the lord it is said therefore yasysti bhaktir bhagavaty akican

such a bewildering condition of existence bhaya dvitybhiniveata syt bhg 11237 such fearfulness and loss of mental equilibrium take place in persons who are too affected by material conditions arjuna

vipartni are significant when a man sees only frustration in his expectations he thinks why am i here everyone is interested in himself and his own welfare no one is interested in the supreme self arjuna is showing ignorance of his real selfinterest by kas will ones real selfinterest lies in viu or ka the conditioned soul forgets this and therefore suffers material pains arjuna thought that his

hoping to be happy in such situations in such a blind conception of life they forget even the causes of material happiness arjuna appears to have even forgotten the moral codes for a katriya it is said that two kinds of men namely the katriya who dies directly in front of the battlefield under kas personal orders and the person in the renounced order of life who is absolutely devoted to spiritual culture are eligible to enter into the sun globe which is so powerful and dazzling arjuna is reluctant even to kill his enemies let alone his relatives he thinks that by killing his kinsmen there would be no happiness in his life and therefore he is not willing to fight just as a person who does not feel hunger is not inclined to cook he has now decided to go into the forest and live a secluded life in frustration but as a katriya he requires a kingdom for his subsistence because the katriyas cannot engage themselves in any other occupation but arjuna has no kingdom arjunas sole opportunity for gaining a kingdom lies in fighting with his cousins and brothers and reclaiming the kingdom inherited from his father which he does not like to do therefore he considers himself fit to go to the forest to live a secluded life of frustration texts 3235 ik naae rajyaena gaaeivnd ik aaegaejasivtaena va yaezamaqaer kaxiata naae rajya aaegaa sauaina c 32 ta wmaevisqataa yaue paaaastyaa

wish to kill them even though they might otherwise kill me o maintainer of all living entities i am not prepared to fight with them even in exchange for the three worlds let alone this earth what pleasure will we derive from killing the sons of dhtarra purport arjuna has addressed lord ka as govinda because ka is the object of all pleasures for cows and the senses by using this significant word arjuna indicates that ka should understand what will satisfy arjunas senses but govinda is not meant for satisfying our senses if we try to satisfy the senses of govinda however then automatically our own senses are satisfied materially everyone wants to satisfy his senses and he wants god to be the order supplier for such satisfaction the lord will satisfy the senses of the living entities as much as they deserve but not to the extent that they may covet but when one takes the opposite waynamely when one tries to satisfy the senses of govinda without desiring to satisfy ones own sensesthen by the grace of govinda all desires of the living entity are satisfied arjunas deep affection for community and family members is exhibited here partly due to his natural compassion for them he is therefore not prepared to fight everyone wants to show his opulence to friends and relatives but arjuna fears that all his relatives and friends will be killed on the battlefield and he will be unable to share his opulence after victory this is a typical calculation of material life copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved the transcendental life however is different since a devotee wants to satisfy the desires of the lord he can lord willing accept all kinds of opulence for the service of the lord and if the lord is not willing he should not accept a farthing arjuna did not want to kill his relatives and if there were any need to kill them he desired that ka kill them personally at this point he did not know that ka had already killed them before their coming into the battlefield and that he was only to become an instrument for ka this fact is disclosed in following chapters as a natural devotee of the lord arjuna did not like to retaliate against his miscreant cousins and brothers but it was the lords plan that they should all be killed the devotee of the lord does not retaliate against the wrongdoer but the lord does not tolerate any mischief done to the devotee by the miscreants the lord can excuse a person on his own account but he excuses no one who has done harm to his devotees therefore the lord was determined to kill the miscreants although arjuna wanted to excuse them text 36 paapamaevayaedsmaanhtvetaanaatataaiyana tasmaaahar vya hntau daatarraansabandavana svjana ih kqa htva sauina

slay such aggressors therefore it is not proper for us to kill the sons of dhtarra and our friends what should we gain o ka husband of the goddess of fortune and how could we be happy by killing our own kinsmen purport according to vedic injunctions there are six kinds of aggressors 1 a poison giver 2 one who sets fire to the house 3 one who attacks with deadly weapons 4 one who plunders riches 5 one who occupies anothers land and 6 one who kidnaps a wife such aggressors are at once to be killed and no sin is incurred by killing such aggressors such killing of aggressors is quite befitting any ordinary man but arjuna was not an ordinary person he was saintly by character and therefore he wanted to deal with them in saintliness this kind of saintliness however is not for a katriya although a responsible man in the administration of a state is required to be saintly he should not be cowardly for example lord rma was so saintly that people even now are anxious to live in the kingdom of lord rma rmarjya but lord rma never showed any cowardice rvaa was an aggressor against rma because rvaa kidnapped rmas wife st but lord rma gave him sufficient lessons unparalleled in the history of the world in arjunas case however one should consider the special type of aggressors namely his own grandfather own teacher friends sons grandsons etc because of them arjuna thought that he should not take the severe steps necessary against ordinary aggressors besides that saintly persons are advised to forgive such injunctions for saintly persons are more important than any political copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved emergency arjuna considered that rather than kill his own kinsmen for political reasons it would be better to forgive them on grounds of religion and saintly behavior he did not therefore consider such killing profitable simply for the matter of temporary bodily happiness after all kingdoms and pleasures derived therefrom are not permanent so why should he risk his life and eternal salvation by killing his own kinsmen arjunas addressing of ka as mdhava or the husband of the goddess of fortune is also significant in this connection he wanted to point out to ka that as husband of the goddess of fortune he should not induce arjuna to take up a matter which would ultimately bring about misfortune ka however never brings misfortune to anyone to say nothing of his devotees texts 3738 yapyaetae na paxyainta laeaaepahtacetasa kulayakta daez imaadaehe c paatakma 37 kqa na jeyamasmaaia paapaadsmaaivitartauma kulayakta daez

party under such an obligation arjuna could not refuse to fight because he had been challenged by the party of duryodhana in this connection arjuna considered that the other party might be blind to the effects of such a challenge arjuna however could see the evil consequences and could not accept the challenge obligation is actually binding when the effect is good but when the effect is otherwise then no one can be bound considering all these pros and cons arjuna decided not to fight text 39 kulayae paaxyainta kuldamaar sanaatanaa damaer nae kul ktmadamaaeriaavtyauta 39 kulakaye

religious traditions to help members of the family grow properly and attain spiritual values the elder members are responsible for such purifying processes in the family beginning from birth to death but on the death of the elder members such family traditions of purification may stop and the remaining younger family members may develop irreligious habits and thereby lose their chance for

prominent in the family o ka the women of the family become polluted and from the degradation of womanhood o descendant of vi comes unwanted progeny purport good population in human society is the basic principle for peace prosperity and spiritual progress in life the varrama religions principles were so designed that the good population would prevail in society for the general spiritual progress of state and community such population depends on the chastity and faithfulness of its womanhood as children are very prone to be misled women are similarly very prone to degradation therefore both children and women require protection by the elder members of the family by being engaged in various religious practices women will not be misled into adultery according to cakya paita women are generally not very intelligent and therefore not trustworthy so the different family traditions of religious activities should always engage them and thus their chastity and devotion will give birth to a good population eligible for participating in the varrama system on the failure of such varramadharma naturally the women become free to act and mix with men and thus adultery is indulged in at the risk of unwanted population irresponsible men also provoke adultery in society and thus unwanted children flood the human race at the risk of war and pestilence copyright 1998 the

to the rules and regulations of fruitive activities there is a need to offer periodical food and water to the forefathers of the family this offering is performed by worship of viu because eating the remnants of food offered to viu can deliver one from all kinds of sinful actions sometimes the forefathers may be suffering from various types of sinful reactions and sometimes some of them cannot even acquire a gross material body and are forced to remain in subtle bodies as ghosts thus when remnants of prasdam copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved food are offered to forefathers by descendants the forefathers are released from ghostly or other kinds of miserable life such help rendered to forefathers is a family tradition and those who are not in devotional life are required to perform such rituals one who is engaged in the devotional life is not required to perform such actions simply by performing devotional service one can deliver hundreds and thousands of forefathers from all kinds of misery it is stated in the bhgavatam 11541 devaribhtptan pit na kikaro nyam ca rjan sarvtman ya araa araya gato mukunda parihtya kartam anyone who has

anuurumai have heard by disciplic succession translation o ka maintainer of the people i have heard by disciplic succession that those who destroy family traditions dwell always in hell purport arjuna bases his argument not on his own personal experience but on what he has heard from the authorities that is the way of receiving real knowledge one cannot reach the real point of factual knowledge without being helped by the right person who is already established in that knowledge there is a system in the varrama institution by which before death one has to undergo the process of atonement for his sinful activities one who is always engaged in sinful activities must utilize the process of atonement called the pryacitta without doing so one surely will be transferred to hellish planets to

man is senseless a man fallen in the ocean of nescience cannot be saved simply by rescuing his outward dressthe gross material body one who does not know this and laments for the outward dress is called a dra or one who laments unnecessarily arjuna was a katriya and this conduct was not expected from him lord ka however can dissipate the lamentation of the ignorant man and for this purpose the bhagavadgt was sung by him this chapter instructs us in selfrealization by an analytical study of the material body and the spirit soul as explained by the supreme authority lord r ka this realization

these impurities come upon you they are not at all befitting a man who knows the value of life they lead not to higher planets but to infamy purport ka and the supreme personality of godhead are identical therefore lord ka is referred to as bhagavn throughout the gt bhagavn is the ultimate in the absolute truth absolute truth is realized in three phases of understanding namely brahman or the impersonal allpervasive spirit copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved paramtm or the localized aspect of the supreme within the heart of all living entities and bhagavn or the supreme personality of godhead lord ka in the rmadbhgavatam 1211 this conception of the absolute truth is explained thus vadanti tat tattvavidas tattva yaj jnam advayam brahmeti paramtmeti bhagavn iti abdyate the absolute truth is realized in three phases of understanding by the knower of the absolute truth and all of them are identical such phases of the absolute truth are expressed as brahman paramtm and bhagavn these three divine aspects can be explained by the example of the sun which also has three different aspects namely the sunshine the suns surface and the sun planet itself one who studies the sunshine only is the preliminary student one who understands the suns surface is further advanced and one who can enter into the sun planet is the highest ordinary students who are satisfied by simply understanding the sunshineits universal pervasiveness and the glaring effulgence of its impersonal naturemay be compared to those who can realize only the brahman feature of the absolute truth the student who has advanced still further can know the sun disc which is compared to knowledge of the paramtm feature of the absolute truth and the student who can enter into the heart of the sun planet is compared to those who realize the personal features of the supreme absolute truth therefore the bhaktas or the transcendentalists who have realized the bhagavn feature of the absolute truth are the topmost transcendentalists although all students who are engaged in the study of the absolute truth are engaged in the same subject matter the sunshine the sun disc and the inner affairs of the sun planet cannot be separated from one another and yet the students of the three different phases are not in the same category the sanskrit word bhagavn is explained by the great authority parara muni the father of vysadeva the supreme personality who possesses all riches all strength all fame all beauty all knowledge and all renunciation is copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved called bhagavn there are many persons who are very rich very powerful very beautiful very famous very learned and very much detached but no one can claim that he possesses all riches all strength etc entirely only ka can claim this because he is the supreme personality of godhead no living entity including brahm lord iva or nryaa can possess opulences as fully as ka therefore it is concluded in the brahmasahit by lord brahm himself that lord ka is the supreme personality of godhead no one is equal to or above him he is the primeval lord or bhagavn known as govinda and he is the supreme cause of all causes vara parama ka saccidnandavigraha andir dir govinda sarvakraakraam there are many personalities possessing the qualities of bhagavn but ka is the supreme because none can excel him he is the supreme person and his body is eternal full of knowledge and bliss he is the primeval lord govinda and the cause of all causes brahmasahit 51 in the bhgavatam also there is a list of many incarnations of the supreme personality of godhead but ka is described as the original personality of godhead from whom many many incarnations and personalities of godhead expand ete cakal pusa kas tu bhagavn svayam indrrivykula loka mayanti yuge yuge all the lists of the incarnations of godhead submitted herewith are either plenary expansions or parts of the plenary expansions of the supreme godhead but ka is the supreme personality of godhead himself bhg 1328 therefore ka is the original supreme personality of godhead the absolute truth the source of both the supersoul and the impersonal copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved brahman in the presence of the supreme personality of godhead arjunas lamentation for his kinsmen is certainly unbecoming and therefore ka expressed his surprise with the word kuta wherefrom such impurities were never expected from a person belonging to the civilized class of men known as ryans the word ryan is applicable to persons who know the value of life and have a civilization based on spiritual realization persons who are led by the material conception of life do not know that the aim of life is realization of the absolute truth viu or bhagavn and they are captivated by the external features of the material world and therefore they do not know what liberation is persons who have no knowledge of liberation from material bondage are called nonryans although arjuna was a katriya he was deviating from his prescribed duties by declining to fight this act of cowardice is described as befitting the nonryans such deviation from duty does not help one in the progress of spiritual life nor does it even give one the opportunity to become famous in this world lord ka did not approve of the socalled compassion of arjuna for his kinsmen text 3 ebya maa sma gama paaqar naetatvyyaupapatae aud dyadaebrlya tyaaeita parntapa 3 klaibya m sma gama prtha naitat tvayy upapadyate

father vasudeva therefore arjuna had a blood relationship with ka if the son of a katriya declines to fight he is a katriya in name only and if the son of a brhmaa acts impiously he is a brhmaa in name only such katriyas and brhmaas are unworthy sons of their fathers therefore ka did not want arjuna to become an unworthy son of a katriya arjuna was the most intimate friend of ka and ka was directly guiding him on the chariot but in spite of all these credits if arjuna abandoned the battle he would be committing an infamous act therefore ka said that such an attitude in arjuna did not fit his personality arjuna might argue that he would give up the battle on the grounds of his magnanimous attitude for the most respectable bhma and his relatives but ka considered that sort of magnanimity mere weakness of heart such false magnanimity was not approved by any authority therefore such magnanimity or socalled nonviolence should be given up by persons like arjuna under the

we killed the sons of dhtarra we should not care to live yet they are now standing before us on the battlefield purport arjuna did not know whether he should fight and risk unnecessary violence although fighting is the duty of the katriyas or whether he should refrain and live by begging if he did not conquer the enemy begging would be his only means of subsistence nor was there certainty of victory because either side might emerge victorious even if victory awaited them and their copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved cause was justified still if the sons of dhtarra died in battle it would be very difficult to live in their absence under the circumstances that would be another kind of defeat for them all these considerations by arjuna definitely proved that not only was he a great devotee of the lord but he was also highly enlightened and had complete control over his mind and senses his desire to live by begging although he was born in the royal household is another sign of detachment he was truly virtuous as these qualities combined with his faith in the words of instruction of r ka his spiritual master indicate it is concluded that arjuna was quite fit for liberation unless the senses are controlled there is no chance of elevation to the platform of knowledge and without knowledge and devotion there is no chance of liberation arjuna was competent in all these attributes over and above his enormous attributes in his material relationships text 7 kaparyadaezaepahtasvaav pacaima tva damarsammaucetaa yaceya syaaiita buih tanmae

me purport by natures own way the complete system of material activities is a source of perplexity for everyone in every step there is perplexity and therefore it behooves one to approach a bona fide spiritual master who can give one proper guidance for executing the purpose of life all vedic literatures advise us to approach a bona fide spiritual master to get free from the perplexities of life which happen without our desire they are like a forest fire that somehow blazes without being set by anyone similarly the world situation is such that perplexities of life automatically appear without our wanting such confusion no one wants fire and yet it takes place and we become perplexed the vedic wisdom therefore advises that in order to solve the perplexities of life and to understand the science of the solution one must approach a spiritual master who is in the disciplic succession a person with a bona fide spiritual master is supposed to know everything one should not therefore remain in material perplexities but should approach a spiritual master this is the purport of this verse who is the man in material perplexities it is he who does not understand the problems of life in the bhadrayaka upaniad 3810 the perplexed man is described as follows yo v etad akara grgy aviditvsm lokt praiti sa kpaa he is a miserly man who does not solve the problems of life as a human and who thus quits this world like the cats and dogs without understanding the science of selfrealization this human form of life is a most valuable asset for the living entity who can utilize it for solving the problems of life therefore one who does not utilize this opportunity properly copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved is a miser on the other hand there is the brhmaa or he who is intelligent enough to utilize this body to solve all the problems of life ya etad akara grgi viditvsm lokt praiti sa brhmaa the kpaas or miserly persons waste their time in being overly affectionate for family society country etc in the material conception of life one is often attached to family life namely to wife children and other members on the basis of skin disease the kpaa thinks that he is able to protect his family members from death or the kpaa thinks that his family or society can save him from the verge of death such family attachment can be found even in the lower animals who take care of children also being intelligent arjuna could understand that his affection for family members and his wish to protect them from death were the causes of his perplexities although he could understand that his duty to fight was awaiting him still on account of miserly weakness he could not discharge the duties he is therefore asking lord ka the supreme spiritual master to make a definite solution he offers himself to ka as a disciple he wants to stop friendly talks talks between the master and the disciple are serious and now arjuna wants to talk very seriously before the recognized spiritual master ka is therefore the original spiritual master of the science of bhagavadgt and arjuna is the first disciple for understanding the gt how arjuna understands the bhagavadgt is stated in the gt itself and yet foolish mundane scholars explain that one need not submit to ka as a person but to the unborn within ka there is no difference between kas within and without and one who has no sense of this understanding is the greatest fool in trying to understand bhagavadgt text 8 na ih papaxyaaima mamaapanaua caekmaucaezaimaindyaaaama avapya aumaavsapama

knowledge of the principles of religion and moral codes it appears that he was unable to solve his real problem without the help of the spiritual master lord r ka he could understand that his socalled knowledge was useless in driving away his problems which were drying up his whole existence and it was impossible for him to solve such perplexities without the help of a spiritual master like lord ka academic knowledge scholarship high position etc are all useless in solving the problems of life help can be given only by a spiritual master like ka therefore the conclusion is that a spiritual master who is one hundred percent ka conscious is the bona fide spiritual master for he can solve the problems of life lord caitanya said that one who is master copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book

not matter whether a person is a vipra learned scholar in vedic wisdom or is born in a lower family or is in the renounced order of lifeif he is master in the science of ka he is the perfect and bona

vipro mantratantravirada avaiavo gurur na syd vaiava vapaco guru a scholarly brhmaa expert in all subjects of vedic knowledge is unfit to become a spiritual master without being a vaiava or expert in the science of ka consciousness but a person born in a family of a lower caste can become a spiritual master if he is a vaiava or ka conscious padma pura the problems of material existencebirth old age disease and deathcannot be counteracted by accumulation of wealth and economic development in many parts of the world there are states which are replete with all facilities of life which are full of wealth and economically developed yet the problems of material existence are still present they are seeking peace in different ways but they can achieve real happiness only if they consult ka or the bhagavadgt and rmadbhgavatamwhich constitute the science of kathrough the bona fide representative of ka the man in ka consciousness if economic development and material comforts could drive away ones lamentations for family social national or international inebrieties then arjuna would not have said that even an unrivaled kingdom on earth or supremacy like that of the demigods in the heavenly planets would be unable copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved to drive away his lamentations he sought therefore refuge in ka consciousness and that is the right path for peace and harmony economic development or supremacy over the world can be finished at any moment by the cataclysms of material nature even elevation into a higher planetary situation as men are now seeking on the moon planet can also be finished at one stroke the bhagavadgt confirms this ke puye martyaloka vianti when the results of pious activities are finished one falls down again from the peak of happiness to the lowest status of life many politicians of the world have fallen down in that way such downfalls only constitute more causes for lamentation therefore if we want to curb lamentation for good then we have to take shelter of ka as arjuna is seeking to do so arjuna asked ka to solve his problem definitely and that is the way of ka consciousness text 9 saya ovac wvmaua

begging profession but sajaya disappointed him again in relating that arjuna was competent to kill his enemies parantapa although arjuna was for the time being overwhelmed with false grief due to family affection he surrendered unto ka the supreme spiritual master as a disciple this indicated that he would soon be free from the false lamentation resulting from family affection and would be enlightened with perfect knowledge of selfrealization or ka consciousness and would then surely fight thus dhtarras joy would be frustrated since arjuna would be enlightened by ka and would fight to

student of the other ka was smiling because a friend had chosen to become a disciple as lord of all he is always in the superior position as the master of everyone and yet the lord agrees to be a friend a son or a lover for a devotee who wants him in such a role but when he was accepted as the master he at once assumed the role and talked with the disciple like the masterwith gravity as it is required it appears that the talk between the master and the disciple was openly exchanged in the presence of both armies so that all were benefitted so the talks of bhagavadgt are not for any particular person society or community but they are for all and friends or enemies are equally entitled to hear them text 11 qagavanauvac axaaecyaananvxaaecstv pajavada aazsae gataasaunagataasau

do not know that one who is learnedone who knows what is body and what is souldoes not lament for any stage of the body neither in the living nor in the dead condition as explained in later chapters it will be clear that knowledge means to know matter and spirit and the controller of both arjuna argued that religious principles should be given more importance than politics or sociology but he did not know that knowledge of matter soul and the supreme is even more important than religious formularies and because he was lacking in that knowledge he should not have posed himself as a very learned man as he did not happen to be a very learned man he was consequently lamenting for something which was unworthy of lamentation the body is born and is destined to be vanquished today or tomorrow therefore the body is not as important as the soul one who knows this is actually learned and for him there is no cause for lamentation regardless of the condition of the material body copyright 1998

the vedas in the kaha upaniad as well as in the vetvatara upaniad it is said that the supreme personality of godhead is the maintainer of innumerable living entities in terms of their different situations according to individual work and reaction of work that supreme personality of godhead is also by his plenary portions alive in the heart of every living entity only saintly persons who can

poor fund of knowledge the lord says clearly that he himself arjuna and all the kings who are assembled on the battlefield are eternally individual beings and that the lord is eternally the maintainer of the individual living entities both in their conditioned and in their liberated situations the supreme personality of godhead is the supreme individual person and arjuna the lords eternal associate and all the kings assembled there are individual eternal persons it is not that they did not exist as individuals in the past and it is not that they will not remain eternal persons their individuality existed in the past and their individuality will continue in the future without interruption therefore there is no cause for lamentation for anyone the myvd theory that after liberation the individual soul separated by the covering of my or illusion will merge into the impersonal brahman and lose its individual existence is not supported herein by lord ka the supreme authority nor is the theory that we only think of individuality in the conditioned state supported herein ka clearly says herein that in the future also the individuality of the lord and others as it is confirmed in the upaniads will continue eternally this statement of kas is authoritative because ka cannot be subject to illusion if individuality were not a fact then ka would not have stressed it so mucheven for the future the myvd may argue that the individuality spoken of by ka is not spiritual but material even accepting the argument that the individuality is material then how can one distinguish kas individuality ka affirms his individuality in the past and confirms his individuality in the future also he has confirmed his individuality in many ways and impersonal brahman has been declared to be subordinate to him ka has maintained spiritual individuality all along if he is accepted as an ordinary conditioned soul in individual consciousness then his bhagavadgt has no value as authoritative scripture a common man with all the four defects of human frailty is unable to teach that which is worth hearing the gt is above such literature no copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved mundane book compares with the bhagavadgt when one accepts ka as an ordinary man the gt loses all importance the myvd argues that the plurality mentioned in this verse is conventional and that it refers to the body but previous to this verse such a bodily conception is already condemned after condemning the bodily conception of the living entities how was it possible for ka to place a conventional proposition on the body again therefore individuality is maintained on spiritual grounds and is thus confirmed by great cryas like r rmnuja and others it is clearly mentioned in many places in the gt that this spiritual individuality is understood by those who are devotees of the lord those who are envious of ka as the supreme personality of godhead have no bona fide access to the great literature the nondevotees approach to the teachings of the gt is something like that of a bee licking on a bottle of honey one cannot have a taste of honey unless one opens the bottle similarly the mysticism of the bhagavadgt can be understood only by devotees and no one else can taste it as it is stated in the fourth chapter of the book nor can the gt be touched by persons who envy the very existence of the lord therefore the myvd explanation of the gt is a most misleading presentation of the whole truth lord caitanya has forbidden us to read commentations made by the myvds and warns that one who takes to such an understanding of the myvd philosophy loses all power to understand the real mystery of the gt if individuality refers to the empirical universe then there is no need of teaching by the lord the plurality of the individual soul and of the lord is an eternal fact and it is confirmed by the vedas as above mentioned text 13 deihnaaeismanyaqaa dehe kaemaar yaaevna

tatrathereupon nanever muhyatiis deluded translation as the embodied soul continuously passes in this body from boyhood to youth to old age the soul similarly passes into another body at death a sober person is not bewildered by such a change purport since every living entity is an individual soul each is changing his body every moment manifesting sometimes as a child sometimes as a youth and sometimes as an old man yet the same spirit soul is there and does not undergo any change this individual soul finally changes the body at death and transmigrates to another body and since it is sure to have another body in the next birtheither material or spiritualthere was no cause for lamentation by arjuna on account of death neither for bhma nor for droa for whom he was so much concerned rather he should rejoice for their changing bodies from old to new ones thereby rejuvenating their energy such changes of body account for varieties of enjoyment or suffering according to ones work in life so bhma and droa being noble souls were surely going to have spiritual bodies in the next life or at least life in heavenly bodies for superior enjoyment of material existence so in either case there was no cause of lamentation any man who has perfect knowledge of the constitution of the individual soul the supersoul and natureboth material and spiritualis called a dhra or a most sober man such a man is never deluded by the change of bodies copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved the myvd theory of oneness of the spirit soul cannot be entertained on the ground that the spirit soul cannot be cut into pieces as a fragmental portion such cutting into different individual souls would make the supreme cleavable or changeable against the principle of the supreme souls being unchangeable as confirmed in the gt the fragmental portions of the supreme exist eternally santana and are called kara that is they have a tendency to fall down into material nature these fragmental portions are eternally so and even after liberation the individual soul remains the samefragmental but once liberated he lives an eternal life in bliss and knowledge with the personality of godhead the theory of reflection can be applied to the supersoul who is present in each and every individual body and is known as the paramtm he is different from the individual living entity when the sky is reflected in water the reflections represent both the sun and the moon and the stars also the stars can be compared to the living entities and the sun or the moon to the supreme lord the individual fragmental spirit soul is represented by arjuna and the supreme soul is the personality of godhead r ka they are not on the same level as it will be apparent in the beginning of the fourth chapter if arjuna is on the same level with ka and ka is not superior to arjuna then their relationship of instructor and instructed becomes meaningless if both of them are deluded by the illusory energy my then there is no need of one being the instructor and the other the instructed such instruction would be useless because in the clutches of my no one can be an authoritative instructor under the circumstances it is admitted that lord ka is the supreme lord superior in position to the living entity arjuna who is a forgetful soul deluded by my text 14 maaaaspaxaarstau

thorough study of oneself the difference between oneself and the supreme being understood as the relationship between the part and the whole in the vedntastras as well as in the rmadbhgavatam the supreme has been accepted as the origin of all emanations such emanations are experienced by superior and inferior natural sequences the living entities belong to the superior nature as it will be

air its spiritual influence is exhibited the hahayoga system is meant for controlling the five kinds of air encircling the pure soul by different kinds of sitting posturesnot for any material profit but for liberation of the minute soul from the entanglement of the material atmosphere so the constitution of the atomic soul is admitted in all vedic literatures and it is also actually felt in the practical experience of any sane man only the insane man can think of this atomic soul as allpervading viutattva the influence of the atomic soul can be spread all over a particular body according to the muaka upaniad this atomic soul is situated in the heart of every living entity and because the measurement of the atomic soul is beyond the power of appreciation of the material scientists some of them assert foolishly that there is no soul the individual atomic soul is definitely there in the heart along with the supersoul and thus all the energies of bodily movement are emanating from this part of the body the corpuscles which carry the oxygen from the lungs gather energy from the soul when the soul passes away from this position the activity of the blood generating fusion ceases medical science accepts the importance of the red corpuscles but it cannot ascertain that the source of the energy is the soul medical science however does admit that the heart is the seat of all energies of the body such atomic particles of the spirit whole are compared to the sunshine molecules in the sunshine there are innumerable radiant molecules similarly the fragmental parts of the supreme lord are atomic sparks of the rays of the supreme lord called by the name prabh or superior energy so whether one follows vedic knowledge or modern science one cannot deny the existence of the spirit soul in the body and the science of the soul is explicitly described in copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved the bhagavadgt by the personality of godhead himself

perishable by nature it may perish immediately or it may do so after a hundred years it is a question of time only there is no chance of maintaining it indefinitely but the spirit soul is so minute that it cannot even be seen by an enemy to say nothing of being killed as mentioned in the previous verse it is so small that no one can have any idea how to measure its dimension so from both viewpoints there is no cause of lamentation because the living entity as he is cannot be killed nor can the material body be saved for any length of time or permanently protected the copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved minute particle of the whole spirit acquires this material body according to his work and therefore observance of religious principles should be utilized in the vedntastras the living entity is qualified as light because he is part and parcel of the supreme light as sunlight maintains the entire universe so the light of the soul maintains this material body as soon as the spirit soul is out of this material body the body begins to decompose therefore it is the spirit soul which maintains this body the body itself is unimportant arjuna was advised to fight and not sacrifice the cause of religion for material bodily considerations text 19 ya wna veita hntaar yaena manyatae htama oaae taae na ivjaanaqtaae naaya hinta na hnyatae 19 ya ena

for the soul there is neither birth nor death at any time he has not come into being does not come into being and will not come into being he is unborn eternal everexisting and primeval he is not slain when the body is slain purport qualitatively the small atomic fragmental part of the supreme spirit is one with the supreme he undergoes no changes like the body sometimes the soul is called the steady or kastha the body is subject to six kinds of transformations it takes its birth from the womb of the mothers body remains for some time grows produces some effects gradually dwindles and at last vanishes into oblivion the soul however does not go through such changes the soul is not born but because he takes on a material body the body takes its birth the soul does not take birth there and the soul does not die anything which has birth also has death and because the soul has no birth he therefore has no past present or future he is eternal everexisting and primevalthat is there is no trace in history of his coming into being under the impression of the body we seek the history of birth etc of the soul the soul does not at any time become old as the body does the socalled old man therefore feels himself to be in the same spirit as in his childhood or youth the changes of the body do not affect the soul the soul does not deteriorate like a tree nor anything material the soul has no byproduct either the byproducts of the body namely children are also different individual souls and owing to the body they appear as children of a particular man the body develops because of the souls presence but the soul has neither offshoots nor change therefore the soul is free from the six changes of the body in the kaha upaniad 1218 we also find a similar passage which reads na jyate mriyate v vipacin nya kutacin na babhva kacit copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved ajo nitya vato ya puro na hanyate hanyamne arre bg 220 the meaning and purport of this verse is the same as in the bhagavadgt but here in this verse there is one special word vipacit which means learned or with knowledge the soul is full of knowledge or full always with consciousness therefore consciousness is the symptom of the soul even if one does not find the soul within the heart where he is situated one can still understand the presence of the soul simply by the presence of consciousness sometimes we do not find the sun in the sky owing to clouds or for some other reason but the light of the sun is always there and we are convinced that it is therefore daytime as soon as there is a little light in the sky early in the morning we can understand that the sun is in the sky similarly since there is some consciousness in all bodieswhether man or animalwe can understand the presence of the soul this consciousness of the soul is however different from the consciousness of the supreme because the supreme consciousness is allknowledgepast present and future the consciousness of the individual soul is prone to be forgetful when he is forgetful of his real nature he obtains education and enlightenment from the superior lessons of ka but ka is not like the forgetful soul if so kas teachings of bhagavadgt would be useless there are two kinds of soulsnamely the minute particle soul autm and the supersoul vibhutm this is also confirmed in the kaha upaniad 1220 in this way aor ayn mahato mahyn tmsya jantor nihito guhym tam akratu payati vtaoko dhtu prasdn mahimnam tmana both the supersoul paramtm and the atomic soul jvtm are situated on the same tree of the body within the same heart of the living being and only one who has become free from all material desires as well as lamentations can by the grace of the supreme understand the glories of the soul ka is copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved the fountainhead of the supersoul also as it will be disclosed in the following chapters and arjuna is the atomic soul forgetful of his real nature therefore he requires to be enlightened by ka or by his bona fide representative the spiritual master text 21 vedaivnaaixana inatya ya wnamajamavyayama kqa sa pauz

person condemned for murder the justice of the peace copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved cannot be blamed because he orders violence to another person according to the codes of justice in manusahit the lawbook for mankind it is supported that a murderer should be condemned to death so that in his next life he will not have to suffer for the great sin he has committed therefore the kings punishment of hanging a murderer is actually beneficial similarly when ka orders fighting it must be concluded that violence is for supreme justice and thus arjuna should follow the instruction knowing well that such violence committed in the act of fighting for ka is not violence at all because at any rate the man or rather the soul cannot be killed so for the administration of justice socalled violence is permitted a surgical operation is not meant to kill the patient but to cure him therefore the fighting to be executed by arjuna at the instruction of ka

individual soul is an accepted fact even the modern scientists who do not believe in the existence of the soul but at the same time cannot explain the source of energy from the heart have to accept continuous changes of body which appear from childhood to boyhood and from boyhood to youth and again from youth to old age from old age the change is transferred to another body this has already been explained in a previous verse 213 transference of the atomic individual soul to another body is made possible by the grace of the supersoul the supersoul fulfills the desire of the atomic soul as one friend fulfills the desire of another the vedas like the muaka upaniad as well as the vetvatara upaniad compare the soul and the supersoul to two friendly birds sitting on the same tree one of the birds the individual atomic soul is eating the fruit of the tree and the other bird ka is simply watching his friend of these two birdsalthough they are the same in qualityone is captivated by the fruits of the material tree while the other is simply witnessing the activities of his friend ka is the witnessing bird and arjuna is the eating bird although they are friends one is still the master and the other is the servant forgetfulness of this relationship by the atomic soul is the cause of ones changing his position from one tree to another or from one body to another the jva soul is struggling very hard on the tree of the material body but as soon as he agrees to accept the other bird as the supreme spiritual masteras arjuna agreed to do by voluntary surrender unto ka for instructionthe subordinate bird immediately becomes free from all lamentations both the muaka upaniad 312 and vetvatara upaniad 47 confirm this copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all

and moroseness as the enjoyer of the fruits of the tree but if in some way or other he turns his face to his friend who is the lord and knows his gloriesat once the suffering bird becomes free from all anxieties arjuna has now turned his face towards his eternal friend ka and is understanding the bhagavadgt from him and thus hearing from ka he can understand the supreme glories of the lord and be free from lamentation arjuna is advised herewith by the lord not to lament for the bodily change of his old grandfather and his teacher he should rather be happy to kill their bodies in the righteous fight so that they may be cleansed at once of all reactions from various bodily activities one who lays down his life on the sacrificial altar or in the proper battlefield is at once cleansed of bodily reactions and promoted to a higher status of life so there was no cause for arjunas lamentation text 23 naena indinta xaaia naena dhita paavk na cena edyantyaapaae na xaaezyaita

individual soul came into existence simply by ignorance and consequently became covered by illusory energy nor was it ever possible to cut the individual souls from the original supreme soul rather the individual souls are eternally separated parts of the supreme soul because they are atomic individual souls eternally santana they are prone to be covered by the illusory energy and thus they become separated from the association of the supreme lord just as the sparks of a fire although one in quality with the fire are prone to be extinguished when out of the fire in the varha pura the living entities are described as separated parts and parcels of the supreme they are eternally so according to the bhagavadgt also so even after being liberated from illusion the living entity remains

from material contamination the atomic soul may prefer to remain as a spiritual spark in the effulgent rays of the supreme personality of godhead but the intelligent souls copyright 1998 the

that living entities are all over gods creation they live on the land in the water in the air within the earth and even within fire the belief that they are sterilized in fire is not acceptable

cannot be seen even by the most powerful microscope therefore he is invisible as far as the souls existence is concerned no one can establish his existence experimentally beyond the proof of ruti or vedic wisdom we have to accept this truth because there is no other source of understanding the existence of the soul although it is a fact by perception there are many things we have to accept solely on grounds of superior authority no one can deny the existence of his father based upon the authority of his mother there is no source of understanding the identity of the father except by the authority of the mother similarly there is no source of understanding the soul except by studying the vedas in other words the soul is inconceivable by human experimental knowledge the soul is consciousness and consciousthat also is the statement of the vedas and we have to accept that unlike the bodily changes there is no change in the soul as eternally unchangeable the soul remains atomic in comparison to the infinite supreme soul the supreme soul is infinite and the atomic soul is infinitesimal therefore the infinitesimal soul being unchangeable can never become equal to the infinite soul or the supreme personality of godhead this concept is repeated in the vedas in different ways just to confirm the stability of the conception of the soul repetition of something is necessary in

existence of the soul beyond the body when lord ka spoke the bhagavadgt it appears that such philosophers existed and they were known as the lokyatikas and vaibhikas such philosophers maintain that life symptoms take place at a certain mature condition of material combination the modern material scientist and materialist philosophers also think similarly according to them the body is a combination of physical elements and at a certain stage the life symptoms develop by interaction of the physical and chemical elements the science of anthropology is based on this philosophy currently many pseudo religionsnow becoming fashionable in americaare also adhering to this philosophy as well as to the nihilistic nondevotional buddhist sects even if arjuna did not believe in the existence of the soulas in the vaibhika philosophythere would still have been no cause for lamentation no one laments the loss of a certain bulk of chemicals and stops discharging his prescribed duty on the other hand in modern science and scientific warfare so many tons of chemicals are wasted for achieving victory over the enemy according to the vaibhika philosophy the socalled soul or tm vanishes along with the deterioration of the body so in any case whether copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved arjuna accepted the vedic conclusion that there is an atomic soul or he did not believe in the existence of the soul he had no reason to lament according to this theory since there are so many living entities generating out of matter every moment and so many of them are being vanquished every moment there is no need to grieve for such incidents if there were no rebirth for the soul arjuna had no reason to be afraid of being affected by sinful reactions due to his killing his grandfather and teacher but at the same time ka sarcastically addressed arjuna as mahbhu mightyarmed because he at least did not accept the theory of the vaibhikas which leaves aside the vedic wisdom as a katriya arjuna belonged to the vedic culture and it behooved him to continue to follow its principles text 27 jaatasya ih dauvae matyaudaurv janma matasya c tasmaadpairhayaerqaer na

believing in the existence of the soul there is no cause for lamentation in either case nonbelievers in the existence of the soul are called atheists by followers of vedic wisdom yet even if for arguments sake we accept this atheistic theory there is still no cause for lamentation apart from the separate existence of the soul the material elements remain unmanifested before creation from this subtle state of nonmanifestation comes manifestation just as from ether air is generated from air fire is generated from fire water is generated and from water earth becomes manifested from the earth many varieties of manifestations take place take for example a big skyscraper manifested from the earth when it is dismantled the manifestation becomes again unmanifested and remains as atoms in the ultimate stage the law of conservation of energy remains but in course of time things are manifested and unmanifestedthat is the difference then what cause is there for lamentation either in the stage of manifestation or in unmanifestation somehow or other even in the unmanifested stage things are not lost both at the beginning and at the end all elements remain unmanifested and only in the middle are they manifested and this does not make any real material difference and if we accept the vedic conclusion as stated in the bhagavadgt that these material bodies are perishable in due course of time antavanta ime deh but that the soul is eternal nityasyokt arria then we must remember always that the body is like a dress therefore why lament the changing of a dress the material body has no factual existence in relation to copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved the eternal soul it is something like a dream in a dream we may think of flying in the sky or sitting on a chariot as a king but when we wake up we can see that we are neither in the sky nor seated on the chariot the vedic wisdom encourages selfrealization on the basis of the nonexistence of

it is explained by the greatest authority of knowledge who imparted lessons even to brahm the first living being in the universe owing to a gross material conception of things most men in this age cannot imagine how such a small particle can become both so great and so small so men look at the soul proper as wonderful either by constitution or by description illusioned by the material energy people are so engrossed in subject matters for sense gratification that they have very little time to understand the question of selfunderstanding even though it is a fact that without this selfunderstanding all activities result in ultimate defeat in the struggle for existence perhaps they have no idea that one must think of the soul and thus make a solution to the material miseries some people who are inclined to hear about the soul may be attending lectures in good association but sometimes owing to ignorance they are misguided by acceptance of the supersoul and the atomic soul as one without distinction of magnitude it is very difficult to find a man who perfectly understands the position of the supersoul the atomic soul their respective functions and relationships and all

the soul and who is able to describe the position of the soul in different aspects but if somehow or other one is able to understand the subject matter of the soul then ones life is successful the easiest process for understanding the subject matter of self however is to accept the statements of the bhagavadgt spoken by the greatest authority lord ka without being deviated by other theories but

violence because everyone is benefited by the religious principles involved the animal sacrificed gets a human life immediately without undergoing the gradual evolutionary process from one form to

own sense gratification either in goodness or in passion is subject to the reaction good or bad but he who has completely surrendered himself in the activities of ka consciousness is no longer obliged

demigods nor the sages nor the people in general nor kinsmen nor humanity nor forefathers bhg 11541 that is the indirect hint given by ka to arjuna in this verse and the matter will be more clearly explained in the following verses text 39 wza taeiaihtaa saayae buiyaaergae itvmaa au buya yauae yayaa paaqar kmarbnda pahasyaisa 39 e te bhihit skhye buddhir yoge tv im u buddhy yukto yay prtha

listen as i explain it in terms of working without fruitive results o son of pth when you act in such knowledge you can free yourself from the bondage of works purport according to the nirukti or the vedic dictionary sakhy means that which describes things in detail and skhya refers to that philosophy which copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved describes the real nature of the soul and yoga involves controlling the senses arjunas proposal not to fight was based on sense gratification forgetting his prime duty he wanted to cease fighting because he thought that by not killing his relatives and kinsmen he would be happier than by enjoying the kingdom after conquering his cousins and brothers the sons of dhtarra in both ways the basic principles were for sense gratification happiness derived from conquering them and happiness derived by seeing kinsmen alive are both on the basis of personal sense gratification even at a sacrifice of wisdom and duty ka therefore wanted to explain to arjuna that by killing the body of his grandfather he would not be killing the soul proper and he explained that all individual persons including the lord himself are eternal individuals they were individuals in the past they are individuals in the present and they will continue to remain individuals in the future because all of us are individual souls eternally we simply change our bodily dress in different manners but actually we keep our individuality even after liberation from the bondage of material dress an analytical study of the soul and the body has been very graphically explained by lord ka and this descriptive knowledge of the soul and the body from different angles of vision has been described here as skhya in terms of the nirukti dictionary this skhya has nothing to do with skhya philosophy of the atheist kapila long before the imposter kapilas skhya the skhya philosophy was expounded in the rmadbhgavatam by the true lord kapila the incarnation of lord ka who explained it to his mother devahti it is clearly explained by him that the purua or the supreme lord is active and that he creates by looking over the prakti this is accepted in the vedas and in the gt the description in the vedas indicates that the lord glanced over the prakti or nature and impregnated it with atomic individual souls all these individuals are working in the material world for sense gratification and under the spell of material energy they are thinking of being enjoyers this mentality is dragged to the last point of liberation when the living entity wants to become one with the lord this is the last snare of my or sense gratificatory illusion and it is only after many many births of such sense gratificatory activities that a great soul surrenders unto vsudeva lord ka thereby fulfilling the search after copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved the ultimate truth arjuna has already accepted ka as his spiritual master by surrendering himself unto him iyas te ha dhi m tv prapannam consequently ka will now tell him about the working process in buddhiyoga or karmayoga or in other words the practice of devotional service only for the sense gratification of the lord this buddhiyoga is clearly explained in chapter ten verse ten as being direct communion with the lord who is sitting as paramtm in everyones heart but such communion does not take place without devotional service one who is therefore situated in devotional or transcendental loving service to the lord or in other words in ka consciousness attains to this stage of buddhiyoga by the special grace of the lord the lord says therefore that only to those who are always engaged in devotional service out of transcendental love does he award the pure knowledge of devotion in love in that way the devotee can reach him easily in the everblissful kingdom of god thus the buddhiyoga mentioned in this verse is the devotional service of the lord and the word skhya mentioned herein has nothing to do with the atheistic skhyayoga enunciated by the imposter kapila one should not therefore misunderstand that the skhyayoga mentioned herein has any connection with the atheistic skhya nor did that philosophy have any influence during that time nor would lord ka care to mention such godless philosophical speculations real skhya philosophy is described by lord kapila in the rmadbhgavatam but even that skhya has nothing to do with the current topics here skhya means analytical description of the body and the soul lord ka made an analytical description of the soul just to bring arjuna to the point of buddhiyoga or bhaktiyoga therefore lord kas skhya and lord kapilas skhya as described in the bhgavatam are one and the same they are all bhaktiyoga lord ka said therefore that only the less intelligent class of men make a distinction between skhyayoga and bhaktiyoga skhyayogau pthag bl pravadanti na pait of course atheistic skhyayoga has nothing to do with bhaktiyoga yet the unintelligent claim that the atheistic skhyayoga is referred to in the copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved bhagavadgt one should therefore understand that buddhiyoga means to work in ka consciousness in the full bliss and knowledge of devotional service one who works for the satisfaction of the lord only however difficult such work may be is working under the principles of buddhiyoga and finds himself always in transcendental bliss by such transcendental engagement one achieves all transcendental understanding automatically by the grace of the lord and thus his liberation is complete in itself without his making extraneous endeavors to acquire knowledge there is much difference between work in ka consciousness and work for fruitive results especially in the matter of sense gratification for achieving results in terms of family or material happiness buddhiyoga is therefore the transcendental quality of the work that we perform text 40 naehaiamanaaxaaeista patyavayaae na ivtae svlpamapyasya damarsya aayatae mahtaae ayaata 40 nehbhikramano sti pratyavyo na vidyate svalpam

expectation of sense gratification is the highest transcendental quality of work even a small beginning of such activity finds no impediment nor can that small beginning be lost at any stage any work begun on the material plane has to be completed otherwise the whole attempt becomes a failure but any work begun in ka consciousness has a permanent effect even though not finished the performer of such work is therefore not at a loss even if his work in ka consciousness is incomplete one percent done in ka consciousness bears permanent results so that the next beginning is from the point of two percent whereas in material activity without a hundred percent success there is no profit ajmila performed his duty in some percentage of ka consciousness but the result he enjoyed at the end was a hundred percent by the grace of the lord there is a nice verse in this connection in rmadbhgavatam 1517 tyaktv svadharma carambuja harer bhajann apakvo tha patet tato yadi yatra kva vbhadram abhd amuya ki ko vrtha pto bhajat svadharmata if someone gives up his occupational duties and works in ka consciousness and then falls down on account of not completing his work what loss is there on his part and what can one gain if one performs his material activities perfectly or as the christians say what profiteth a man if he gain the whole world yet suffers the loss of his eternal soul material activities and their results end with the body but work in ka consciousness carries a person again to ka consciousness even after the loss of the body at least one is sure to have a chance in the next life of being born again as a human being either in the family of a great cultured brhmaa or in a rich aristocratic family that will give one a further chance for elevation copyright 1998 the

material world with obligations to family traditions humanity or nationality fruitive activities are the engagements of ones reactions from past good or bad deeds when one is awake in ka consciousness he need no longer endeavor for good results in his activities when one is situated in ka consciousness all activities are on the absolute plane for they are no longer subject to dualities like good and bad the highest perfection of ka consciousness is renunciation of the material conception of life this state is automatically achieved by progressive ka consciousness the resolute purpose of a person in ka consciousness is based on knowledge vsudeva sarvam iti sa mahtm sudurlabha a person in ka consciousness is the rare good soul who knows perfectly that vsudeva or ka is the root of all manifested causes as by watering the root of a tree one automatically distributes water to the leaves and branches so by acting in ka consciousness one can render the highest service to everyonenamely self family society country humanity etc if ka is satisfied by ones actions then everyone will be satisfied service in ka consciousness is however best practiced under the able guidance of a spiritual master who is a bona fide representative of ka who knows the nature of the student and who can guide him to act in ka consciousness as such to be well versed in ka consciousness one has to act firmly and obey the representative of ka and one should accept the instruction of the bona fide spiritual master as ones mission in life rla vivantha cakravart hkura instructs us in his famous prayers for

inexperienced persons to be situated in the determined action of ka consciousness as fools are attached to the flowers of poisonous trees without knowing the results of such attractions unenlightened men are similarly attracted by such heavenly opulence and the sense enjoyment thereof in the karmaka section of the vedas it is said apma somam amt abhma and akayya ha vai cturmasyayjina sukta bhavati in other words those who perform the fourmonth penances become eligible to drink the somarasa beverages to become immortal and happy forever even on this earth some are very eager to have somarasa to

material nature they are meant for fruitive results which cause bondage in the material world the vedas deal mostly with fruitive activities to gradually elevate the general public from the field of sense gratification to a position on the transcendental plane arjuna as a student and friend of lord ka is advised to raise himself to the transcendental position of vednta philosophy where in the beginning there is brahmajijs or questions on the supreme transcendence all the living entities who are in the material world are struggling very hard for existence for them the lord after creation of the material world gave the vedic wisdom advising how to live and get rid of the material entanglement when the activities for sense gratification namely the karmaka chapter are finished then the chance for spiritual realization is offered in the form of the upaniads which are part of different vedas as the bhagavadgt is a part of the fifth veda namely the mahbhrata the upaniads mark the beginning of transcendental life as long as the material body exists there are actions and reactions in the material modes one has to learn tolerance in the face of dualities such as happiness and distress or cold and warmth and by tolerating such dualities become free from anxieties regarding gain and loss this transcendental position is achieved in full ka consciousness when one is fully

served by a great reservoir of water similarly all the purposes of the vedas can be served to one who knows the purpose behind them purport the rituals and sacrifices mentioned in the karmaka division of the vedic literature are meant to encourage gradual development of selfrealization and the purpose of selfrealization is clearly stated in the fifteenth chapter of the bhagavadgt 1515 the purpose of studying the vedas is to know lord ka the primeval cause of everything so selfrealization means understanding ka and ones eternal relationship with him the relationship of the living entities with ka is also mentioned in the fifteenth chapter of bhagavadgt 157 the living entities are parts and parcels of ka therefore revival of ka consciousness by the individual living entity is the highest perfectional stage of vedic knowledge this is confirmed in the rmadbhgavatam 3337 as follows aho bata vapaco to garyn yajjihvgre vartate nma tubhyam tepus tapas te juhuvu sasnur ry brahmncur nma ganti

the highest platform of selfrealization such a person must have performed all kinds of penances and sacrifices according to vedic rituals and studied the vedic literatures many many times after taking his bath in all the holy places of pilgrimage such a person is considered to be the best of the ryan family so one must be intelligent enough to understand the purpose of the vedas without being attached to the rituals only and must not desire to be elevated to the heavenly kingdoms for a better quality of sense gratification it is not possible for the common man in this age to follow all the rules and regulations of the vedic rituals nor is it possible to study all of the vednta and the upaniads thoroughly it requires much time energy knowledge and resources to execute the purposes of the vedas this is hardly possible in this age the best purpose of vedic culture is served however by chanting the holy name of the lord as recommended by lord caitanya the deliverer of all fallen souls when lord caitanya was asked by a great vedic scholar praknanda sarasvat why he the lord was chanting the holy name of the lord like a sentimentalist instead of studying vednta philosophy the lord replied that his spiritual master had found him to be a great fool and thus asked him to chant the holy name of lord ka he did so and became ecstatic like a madman in this age of kali most of the population is foolish and not adequately educated to understand vednta philosophy the best purpose of vednta philosophy is served by inoffensively chanting the holy name of the lord vednta is the last word in vedic wisdom and the author and knower of the vednta philosophy is lord ka and the highest vedntist is the great soul who takes pleasure in chanting the holy name of the lord that is the ultimate purpose of all vedic mysticism text 47 kmaryaevaidakarstae maa flezu kdacna maa kmarflhetauaurmaar tae saaestvkmaria 47 karmay evdhikras te copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl

without the sanction of authority and inaction means not performing ones prescribed duties the lord advised that arjuna not be inactive but that he perform his prescribed duty without being attached

they can be fitted into three subdivisions namely routine work emergency work and desired activities routine work performed as an obligation in terms of the scriptural injunctions without desire for results is action in the mode of goodness work with results becomes the cause of bondage therefore such work is not auspicious everyone has his proprietary right in regard to prescribed duties

the personality of godhead engages himself in the transcendental loving service of the lord consequently he becomes qualified to enter into the vaikuha planets where there is neither material miserable life nor the influence of time and death to know ones constitutional position means to know also the sublime position of the lord one who wrongly thinks that the living entitys position and the lords position are on the same level is to be understood to be in darkness and therefore unable to engage himself in the devotional service of the lord he becomes a lord himself and thus paves the way for the repetition of birth and death but one who understanding that his position is to serve transfers himself to the service of the lord at once becomes eligible for vaikuhaloka service for the

for me the vedic rites and rituals are imperative for neophytes comprehending all kinds of prayer three times a day taking a bath early in the morning offering respects to the forefathers etc but when

person who is fully in ka consciousness or devotional service of the lord has all the good qualities of the great sages whereas a person who is not so transcendentally situated has no good qualifications because he is sure to be taking refuge in his own mental concoctions consequently it is rightly said herein that one has to give up all kinds of sense desire manufactured by mental concoction artificially such sense desires cannot be stopped but if one is engaged in ka consciousness then automatically sense desires subside without extraneous efforts therefore one has to engage himself in ka consciousness without hesitation for this devotional service will instantly help one onto the platform of transcendental consciousness the highly developed soul always remains satisfied

thinking himself only worthy of more trouble due to his past misdeeds and he sees that his miseries by the grace of the lord are minimized to the lowest similarly when he is happy he gives credit to the lord thinking himself unworthy of the happiness he realizes that it is due only to the lords grace that he is in such a comfortable condition and able to render better service to the lord and for the service of the lord he is always daring and active and is not influenced by attachment or aversion attachment means accepting things for ones own sense gratification and detachment is the absence

how the yog is situated the senses are compared to venomous serpents they want to act very loosely and without restriction the yog or the devotee must be very strong to control the serpentslike a snake charmer he never allows them to act independently there are many injunctions in the revealed scriptures some of them are donots and some of them are dos unless one is able to follow the dos and the donots restricting oneself from sense enjoyment it is not possible to be firmly fixed in ka consciousness the best example set herein is the tortoise the tortoise can at any moment wind up his senses and exhibit them again at any time for particular purposes similarly the senses of the ka conscious persons are used only for some particular purpose in the service of the lord and are withdrawn otherwise arjuna is being taught here to use his senses for the service of the lord instead of for his own satisfaction keeping the senses always in the service of the lord is the example

a diseased person from certain types of eatables the patient however neither likes such restrictions nor loses his taste for eatables similarly sense restriction by some spiritual process like agayoga in the matter of yama niyama sana pryma pratyhra dhra dhyna etc is recommended for less intelligent persons who have no better knowledge but one who has tasted the beauty of the supreme lord ka in the course of his advancement in ka consciousness no longer has a taste for dead material things therefore restrictions are there for the less intelligent neophytes in the spiritual advancement of life

use in the service of the lord those who are without knowledge of ka consciousness artificially try to avoid material objects and as a result although copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved they desire liberation from material bondage they do not attain to the perfect stage of renunciation their socalled renunciation is called phalgu or less important on the other hand a person in ka consciousness knows how to use everything in the service of the lord therefore he does not become a victim of material consciousness for example for an impersonalist the lord or the absolute being impersonal cannot eat whereas an impersonalist tries to avoid good eatables a devotee knows that ka is the supreme enjoyer and that he eats all that is offered to him in devotion so after offering good eatables to the lord the devotee takes the remnants called prasdam thus everything becomes spiritualized and there is no danger of a downfall the devotee takes prasdam in ka consciousness whereas the nondevotee rejects it as material the impersonalist therefore cannot enjoy life due to his artificial renunciation and for this reason a slight agitation of the mind pulls him down again into the pool of material existence it is said that such a soul even though rising up to the point of liberation falls down again due to his not having support in devotional service

senses are engaged in the transcendental service of the lord there is every chance of a fall although the person in full ka consciousness may apparently be on the sensual plane because of his being ka conscious he has no attachment to sensual activities the ka conscious person is concerned only with the satisfaction of ka and nothing else therefore he is transcendental to all attachment and detachment if ka wants the devotee can do anything which is ordinarily undesirable and if ka does not want he shall not do that which he would have ordinarily done for his own satisfaction therefore

possibility of peace so it is confirmed in the fifth chapter 529 that when one understands that ka is the only enjoyer of all the good results of sacrifice and penance that he is the proprietor of all universal manifestations and that he is the real friend of all living entities then only can one have real peace therefore if one is not in ka consciousness there cannot be a final goal for the mind disturbance is due to want of an ultimate goal and when one is certain that ka is the enjoyer proprietor and friend of everyone and everything then one can with a steady mind bring about peace therefore one who is engaged without a relationship with ka is certainly always in distress and is without peace however much he may make a show of peace and spiritual advancement in life ka

also true of a person fixed in ka consciousness as long as one has the material body the demands of the body for sense gratification will continue the devotee however is not disturbed by such desires

ka not an artificial attempt to abolish desires the living entity cannot be desireless or senseless but he does have to change the quality of the desires a materially desireless person certainly knows that everything belongs to ka vsyam ida sarvam and therefore he does not falsely claim proprietorship over anything this transcendental knowledge is based on selfrealizationnamely knowing perfectly

attained this state of life just a few minutes before his death by surrendering unto ka nirva means ending the process of materialistic life according to buddhist philosophy there is only void after the completion of this material life but bhagavadgt teaches differently actual life begins after the completion of this material life for the gross materialist it is sufficient to know that one has to end this materialistic way of life but for persons who are spiritually advanced there is another life after this materialistic life before ending this life if one fortunately becomes ka conscious he at once attains the stage of brahmanirva there is no difference between the kingdom of god and the devotional service of the lord since both of them are on the absolute plane to be engaged in the transcendental loving service of the lord is to have attained the spiritual kingdom in the material world there are activities of sense gratification whereas in the spiritual world there are activities of ka consciousness attainment of ka consciousness even during this life is immediate attainment of brahman and one who is situated in ka consciousness has certainly already entered into

the constitution of the soul in the previous chapter with a view to delivering his intimate friend arjuna from the ocean of material grief and the path of realization has been recommended buddhiyoga or ka consciousness sometimes ka consciousness is misunderstood to be inertia and one with such a misunderstanding often withdraws to a secluded place to become fully ka conscious by chanting the holy name of lord ka but without being trained in the philosophy of ka consciousness it is not advisable to chant the holy name of ka in a secluded place where one may acquire only cheap adoration from the innocent public arjuna also thought of ka consciousness or buddhiyoga or intelligence in spiritual advancement of knowledge as something like retirement from active life and the practice of penance and austerity at a secluded place in other words he wanted to skillfully avoid the fighting by using ka consciousness as an excuse but as a sincere student he placed the matter before his master and questioned ka as to his best course of action in answer lord ka elaborately explained karmayoga or work in ka consciousness in this third chapter text 2 copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust

neophyte this was all presented unsystematically a more organized outline of the path would be necessary for action and understanding arjuna therefore wanted to clear up these apparently confusing matters so that any common man could accept them without misinterpretation although ka had no intention of confusing arjuna by any jugglery of words arjuna could not follow the process of ka

the devotees translation the supreme personality of godhead said o sinless arjuna i have already explained that there are two classes of men who try to realize the self some are inclined to understand it by empirical philosophical speculation and others by devotional service purport in the second chapter verse 39 the lord explained two kinds of proceduresnamely skhyayoga and karmayoga or buddhiyoga in this verse the lord explains the same more clearly skhyayoga or the analytical study of the nature of spirit and matter is the subject matter for persons who copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved are inclined to speculate and understand things by experimental knowledge and philosophy the other class of men work in ka consciousness as it is explained in the 61st verse of the second chapter the lord has explained also in the 39th verse that by working by the principles of buddhiyoga or ka consciousness one can be relieved from the bonds of action and furthermore there is no flaw in the process the same principle is more clearly explained in the 61st versethat this buddhiyoga is to depend entirely on the supreme or more specifically on ka and in this way all the senses can be brought under control very easily therefore both the yogas are interdependent as religion and philosophy religion without philosophy is sentiment or sometimes fanaticism while philosophy without religion is mental speculation the ultimate goal is ka because the philosophers who are also sincerely searching after the absolute truth come in the end to ka consciousness this is also stated in the bhagavadgt the whole process is to understand the real position of the self in relation to the superself the indirect process is philosophical speculation by which gradually one may come to the point of ka consciousness and the other process is directly connecting with everything in ka consciousness of these two the path of ka consciousness is better because it does not depend on purifying the senses by a philosophical process ka consciousness is itself the purifying process and by the direct method of devotional service it is simultaneously easy and sublime text 4

purification one cannot attain success by abruptly adopting the fourth order of life sannysa according to the empirical philosophers simply by adopting sannysa or retiring from fruitive activities one at once becomes as good as nryaa but lord ka does not approve this principle without purification of heart sannysa is simply a disturbance to the social order on the other hand if someone takes to the

moment purport it is not a question of embodied life but it is the nature of the soul to be always active without the presence of the spirit soul the material body cannot move the body is only a dead vehicle to be worked by the spirit soul which is always active and cannot stop even for a moment as such the spirit soul has to be engaged in the good work of ka consciousness otherwise it will be engaged in occupations dictated by illusory energy in contact with material energy the spirit soul acquires material modes and to purify the soul from such affinities it is necessary to engage in the prescribed duties enjoined in the stras but if the soul is engaged in his natural function of ka consciousness whatever he is able to do is good for him the rmadbhgavatam 1517 affirms this tyaktv

someone takes to ka consciousness even though he may not follow the prescribed duties in the stras or execute the devotional service properly and even though he may fall down from the standard there is no loss or evil for him but if he carries out all the injunctions for purification in the stras what does it avail him if he is not ka conscious so the purificatory process is necessary for reaching this point of ka consciousness therefore sannysa or any purificatory process is to help reach the ultimate goal of becoming ka conscious without which everything is considered a failure text

follows the rules and regulations of his particular status he can make gradual progress in purifying his existence but he who makes a show of being a yog while actually searching for the objects of sense gratification must be called the greatest cheater even though he sometimes speaks of philosophy his knowledge has no value because the effects of such a sinful mans knowledge are taken away by

reach this goal of life a householder can also reach this destination by regulated service in ka consciousness for selfrealization one can live a controlled life as prescribed in the stras and

not want arjuna to become a pretender rather the lord desired that arjuna perform his prescribed duties as set forth for katriyas arjuna was a householder and a military general and therefore it was better for him to remain as such and perform his religious duties as prescribed for the householder katriya such activities gradually cleanse the heart of a mundane man and free him from material contamination socalled renunciation for the purpose of maintenance is never approved by the lord nor by any religious scripture after all one has to maintain ones body and soul together by some work work should not be given up capriciously without purification of materialistic propensities anyone who is in the material world is certainly possessed of the impure propensity for lording it over material nature or in other words for sense gratification such polluted propensities have to be cleared without doing so through prescribed duties one should never attempt to become a socalled

one should therefore act very diligently under the expert guidance of a devotee of lord ka or under the direct instruction of lord ka himself under whom arjuna had the opportunity to work nothing

for example the meateaters are recommended to worship the goddess kl the ghastly form of material nature and before the goddess the sacrifice of animals is recommended but for those who are in the

pacamahyaja are necessary one should know however that all the necessities of life that the human society requires are supplied by the demigod agents of the lord no one can manufacture anything take for example all the eatables of human society these eatables include grains fruits vegetables milk sugar etc for the persons in the mode of goodness and also eatables for the nonvegetarians like meats none of which can be manufactured by men then again take for example heat light water air etc which are also necessities of lifenone of them can be manufactured by the human society without the supreme lord there can be no profuse sunlight moonlight rainfall breeze etc without which no one can live obviously our life is dependent on supplies from the lord even for our manufacturing enterprises we require so many raw materials like metal sulphur mercury manganese and so many essentialsall of which are supplied by the agents of the lord with the purpose that we should make proper use of them to keep ourselves fit and healthy for the purpose of selfrealization leading to the ultimate goal of life namely liberation from the material struggle for existence this aim of life is attained by performance of yajas if we forget the purpose of human life and simply take supplies from the agents of the lord for sense gratification and become more and more entangled in material existence which is not the purpose of creation certainly we become thieves and therefore we are punished by the laws of material nature a society of thieves can never be happy because they have no aim

sacrifices to satisfy these demigods so that they may be pleased to supply air light and water sufficiently to produce food grains when lord ka is worshiped the demigods who are different limbs of the lord are also automatically worshiped therefore there is no separate need to worship the demigods for this reason the devotees of the lord who are in ka consciousness offer food to ka and then eata process which nourishes the body spiritually by such action not only are past sinful reactions in the body vanquished but the body becomes immunized to all contamination of material nature when there is an epidemic disease an antiseptic vaccine protects a person from the attack of such an epidemic similarly food offered to lord viu and then taken by us makes us sufficiently resistant to material affection and one who is accustomed to this practice is called a devotee of the lord therefore a person in ka consciousness who eats only food offered to ka can counteract all reactions of past material infections which are impediments to the progress of selfrealization on the other hand one who does not do so continues to increase the volume of sinful action and this prepares the next body to resemble hogs and dogs to suffer the resultant reactions of all sins the material world is full of contaminations and one who is immunized by accepting prasdam of the lord food offered to viu is saved from the attack whereas one who does not do so becomes subjected to contamination food grains or vegetables are factually eatables the human being eats different kinds of food grains vegetables fruits etc and the animals eat the copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved refuse of the food grains and vegetables grass plants etc human beings who are accustomed to eating meat and flesh must also depend on the production of vegetation in order to eat the animals therefore ultimately we have to depend on the production of the field and not on the production of

actions of all other senses in other words the lord can speak through his breathing and he can impregnate by his eyes in fact it is said that he glanced over material nature and thus fathered all living entities after creating or impregnating the conditioned souls into the womb of material nature he gave his directions in the vedic wisdom as to how such conditioned souls can return home back to godhead we should always remember that the conditioned souls in material nature are all eager for material enjoyment but the vedic directions are so made that one can satisfy ones perverted desires then return to godhead having finished his socalled enjoyment it is a chance for the conditioned souls to attain liberation therefore the conditioned souls must try to follow the process of yaja by

conscious to discharge duties as if in military discipline such an injunction may make things a little difficult nevertheless duties must be carried out with dependence on ka because that is the constitutional position of the living entity the living entity cannot be happy independent of the cooperation of the supreme lord because the eternal constitutional position of the living entity is to

lord and at the same time discharge prescribed duties without claiming proprietorship arjuna did not have to consider the order of the lord he had only to execute his order the supreme lord is the soul of all souls therefore one who depends solely and wholly on the supreme soul without personal consideration or in other words one who is fully ka conscious is called adhytmacetas nir means that one has to act on the order of the master but should not expect fruitive results the cashier may count millions of dollars for his employer but he does not claim a cent for himself similarly one has to realize that nothing in the world belongs to any individual person but that everything belongs to the supreme lord that is the real purport of mayi or unto me and when one acts in such ka

consciousness is also eternal one should have firm faith in this injunction without envying the lord there are many philosophers who write comments on the bhagavadgt but have no faith in ka they will never be liberated from the bondage of fruitive action but an ordinary man with firm faith in the eternal injunctions of the lord even though unable to execute such orders becomes liberated from the

simply by theoretical knowledge or by separating the soul from the body there are many socalled spiritualists who outwardly pose as advanced in the science but inwardly or privately are completely under particular modes of nature which they are unable to surpass academically one may be very learned but because of his long association with material nature he is in bondage ka consciousness helps one to get out of the material entanglement even though one may be engaged in his prescribed duties in terms of material existence therefore without being fully in ka consciousness one should not give up his occupational duties no one should suddenly give up his prescribed duties and become a socalled yog or transcendentalist artificially it is better to be situated in ones position and to try to

and aversion because they are stumbling blocks on the path of selfrealization purport those who are in ka consciousness are naturally reluctant to engage in material sense gratification but those who are not in such consciousness should follow the rules and regulations of the revealed scriptures unrestricted sense enjoyment is the cause of material encagement but one who follows the rules and regulations of the revealed scriptures does not become entangled by the sense objects for example sex enjoyment is a necessity for the conditioned soul and sex enjoyment is allowed under the license of marriage ties according to scriptural injunctions one is forbidden to engage in sex relationships with any women other than ones wife all other women are to be considered as ones mother but in spite of such injunctions a man is still inclined to have sex relationships with other women these propensities are to be curbed otherwise they will be stumbling blocks on the path of selfrealization as long as the material body is there the necessities of the material body are allowed but under rules and regulations and yet we should not rely upon the control of such allowances one has to follow those rules and regulations unattached to them because practice of sense gratification under regulations may also lead one to go astrayas much as there is always the chance of an accident even on the royal roads although they may be very carefully maintained no one can guarantee that there will be no danger even copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved on the safest road the sense enjoyment spirit has been current a very long long time owing to material association therefore in spite of regulated sense enjoyment there is every chance of falling down therefore any attachment for regulated sense enjoyment must also be avoided by all means but attachment to ka consciousness or acting always in the loving service of ka detaches one from all kinds of sensory activities therefore no one should try to be detached from ka consciousness at any stage of life the whole purpose of detachment from all kinds of sense attachment is ultimately to become situated on

spiritual one should stick to his prescribed duties even up to death rather than imitate anothers prescribed duties duties on the spiritual platform and duties on the material platform may be different but the principle of following the authorized direction is always good for the performer when one is under the spell of the modes of material nature one should follow the prescribed rules for his particular situation and should not imitate others for example a brhmaa who is in the mode of goodness is nonviolent whereas a katriya who is in the mode of passion is allowed to be violent as such for a katriya it is better to be vanquished following the rules of violence than to imitate a brhmaa who follows the principles of nonviolence everyone has to cleanse his heart by a gradual process not abruptly however when one transcends the modes of material nature and is fully situated in ka consciousness he can perform anything and everything under the direction of a bona fide spiritual master in that complete stage of ka consciousness the katriya may act as a brhmaa or a brhmaa may act as a katriya in the transcendental stage the distinctions of the material world do not apply for example vivmitra was originally a katriya but later on he acted as a brhmaa whereas paraurma was a brhmaa but later on he acted as a katriya being transcendentally situated they could do so but as long as one is on the material platform he must perform his duties according to the modes of material nature at the same time he must have a full sense of ka consciousness text 36 copyright

although the living entity sometimes does not want to act in sin he is still forced to act sinful actions are not however impelled by the supersoul within but are due to another cause as the lord

milk in contact with sour tamarind is transformed into yogurt then again when lust is unsatisfied it turns into wrath wrath is transformed into illusion and illusion continues the material existence therefore lust is the copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved greatest enemy of the living entity and it is lust only which induces the pure living entity to remain entangled in the material world wrath is the manifestation of the mode of ignorance these modes exhibit themselves as wrath and other corollaries if therefore the mode of passion instead of being degraded into the mode of ignorance is elevated to the mode of goodness by the prescribed method of living and acting then one can be saved from the degradation of wrath by spiritual attachment the supreme personality of godhead expanded himself into many for his everincreasing spiritual bliss and the living entities are parts and parcels of this spiritual bliss they also have partial independence but by misuse of their independence when the service attitude is transformed into the propensity for sense enjoyment they come under the sway of lust this material creation is created by the lord to give facility to the conditioned souls to fulfill these lustful propensities and when completely baffled by prolonged lustful activities the living entities begin to inquire about their real position this inquiry is the beginning of the vedntastras wherein it is said athto brahma jijs one should inquire into the supreme and the supreme is defined in rmadbhgavatam as janmdy asya yato nvayd itarata ca or the origin of everything is the supreme brahman therefore the origin of lust is also in the supreme if therefore lust is transformed into love for the supreme or transformed into ka consciousnessor in other words desiring everything for kathen both lust and wrath can be spiritualized hanumn the great servitor of lord rma exhibited his wrath by burning the golden city of rvaa but by doing so he became the greatest devotee of the lord here also in bhagavadgt the lord induces arjuna to engage his wrath upon his enemies for the satisfaction of the lord therefore lust and

by dust or as the embryo is covered by the womb the living entity is similarly covered by different degrees of this lust purport there are three degrees of covering of the living entity by which his pure consciousness is obscured this covering is but lust under different manifestations like smoke in the fire dust on the mirror and the womb about the embryo when lust is compared to smoke it is understood that the fire of the living spark can be a little perceived in other words when the living entity exhibits his ka consciousness slightly he may be likened to the fire covered by smoke although fire is necessary where there is smoke there is no overt manifestation of fire in the early stage this stage is like the beginning of ka consciousness the dust on the mirror refers to a cleansing process of the mirror of the mind by so many spiritual methods the best process is to chant the holy names of the lord the embryo covered by the womb is an analogy illustrating a helpless position for the child in the womb is so helpless copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved that he cannot even move this stage of living condition can be compared to that of the trees the trees are also living entities but they have been put in such a condition of life by such a great exhibition of lust that they are almost void of all consciousness the covered mirror is compared to the birds and beasts and the smokecovered fire is compared to the human being in the form of a human being the living entity may revive a little ka consciousness and if he makes further development the fire of spiritual life can be kindled in the human form of life by careful handling of the smoke in the fire fire can be made to blaze therefore the human form of life is a chance for the living entity to escape the entanglement of material existence in the human form of life one can conquer the enemy lust by cultivation of ka consciousness under able guidance text 39 aavta

it is said in the manusmti that lust cannot be satisfied by any amount of sense enjoyment just as fire is never extinguished by a constant supply of fuel in the material world the center of all activities is sex and thus this material world is called maithunyagra or the shackles of sex life in the ordinary prison house criminals are kept within bars similarly the criminals who are disobedient to the laws of the lord are shackled by sex life advancement of material civilization on the basis of sense gratification means increasing the duration of the material existence of a living entity therefore this lust is the symbol of ignorance by which the living entity is kept within the material world while one enjoys sense gratification it may be that there is some feeling of happiness but actually that socalled feeling of happiness is the ultimate enemy of the sense enjoyer text 40 windyaaia manaae buirsyaaidaanamaucyatae wtaeivrmaaehyatyaez janamaavtya deihnama 40

and the intelligence are the sitting places of this lust through them lust covers the real knowledge of the living entity and bewilders him purport the enemy has captured different strategic positions in the body of the conditioned soul and therefore lord ka is giving hints of those places so that one who wants to conquer the enemy may know where he can be found mind is the center of all the activities of the senses and thus when we hear about sense objects the mind generally becomes a reservoir of all ideas of sense gratification and as a result the mind and the senses become the repositories of lust next the intelligence department becomes the capital of such lustful propensities intelligence is the immediate nextdoor neighbor of the spirit soul lusty intelligence influences the spirit soul to acquire the false ego and identify itself with matter and thus with the mind and senses the spirit soul becomes addicted to enjoying the material senses and mistakes this as true happiness this false identification of the spirit soul is very nicely explained in the rmadbhgavatam 108413 yasytmabuddhi kuape tridhtuke svadh kalatrdiu bhauma ijyadh yattrthabuddhi salile na

the spirit soul is not the body vijna refers to specific knowledge of the spirit souls constitutional position and his relationship to the supreme soul it is explained thus in the rmadbhgavatam 2931 jna paramaguhya me yad vijnasamanvitam copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved sarahasya tadaga ca gha gadita may the knowledge of the self and supreme self is very confidential and mysterious but such knowledge and specific realization can be understood if explained with their various aspects by the lord himself bhagavadgt gives us that general and specific knowledge of the self the living entities are parts and parcels of the lord and therefore they are simply meant to serve the lord this consciousness is called ka consciousness so from the very beginning of life one has to learn this ka consciousness and thereby one may become fully ka conscious and act accordingly lust is only the perverted reflection of the love of god which is natural for every living entity but if one is educated in ka consciousness from the very beginning that natural love of god cannot deteriorate into lust when love of god deteriorates into lust it is very difficult to return to the normal condition nonetheless ka consciousness is so powerful that even a late beginner can become a lover of god by following the regulative principles of devotional service so from any stage of life or from the time of understanding its urgency one can begin regulating the senses in ka consciousness devotional service of the lord and turn the lust into love of godheadthe

reserved within the body but it is given vent through the senses therefore the senses are superior to the body as a whole these outlets are not in use when there is superior consciousness or ka consciousness in ka consciousness the soul makes direct connection with the supreme personality of godhead therefore the hierarchy of bodily functions as described here ultimately ends in the supreme soul bodily action means the functions of the senses and stopping the senses means stopping all bodily actions but since the mind is active then even though the body may be silent and at rest the mind will actas it does during dreaming but above the mind is the determination of the intelligence and above the intelligence is the soul proper if therefore the soul is directly engaged with the supreme naturally all other subordinates namely the intelligence mind and senses will be automatically engaged in the kaha upaniad there is a similar passage in which it is said that the objects of sense gratification are superior to the senses and mind is superior to the sense objects if therefore the mind is directly engaged in the service of the lord constantly then there is no chance that the senses will become engaged in other ways this mental attitude has already been explained para dv nivartate if the mind is engaged in the transcendental service of the lord there is no chance of its being engaged in the lower propensities in the kaha upaniad the soul has been described as mahn the great therefore the copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved soul is above allnamely the sense objects the senses the mind and the intelligence therefore directly understanding the constitutional position of the soul is the solution of the whole problem with intelligence one has to seek out the constitutional position of the soul and then engage the mind always in ka consciousness that solves the whole problem a neophyte spiritualist is generally advised to keep aloof from the objects of the senses but aside from that one has to strengthen the mind by use of intelligence if by intelligence one engages ones mind in ka consciousness by complete surrender unto the supreme personality of godhead then automatically the mind becomes stronger and even though the senses are very strong like serpents they will be no more effective than serpents with broken fangs but even though the soul is the master of intelligence and mind and the senses also still unless it is strengthened by association with ka in ka consciousness there is every chance

the ultimate end in the material existence of life one is certainly influenced by propensities for lust and desire for dominating the resources of material nature desire for overlording and for sense gratification is the greatest enemy of the conditioned soul but by the strength of ka consciousness one can control the material senses the mind and the intelligence one may not give up work and

which lord rmacandra appeared therefore bhagavadgt existed in human society from the time of mahrja ikvku at the present moment we have just passed through five thousand years of the kaliyuga which lasts 432000 years before this there was dvparayuga 800000 years and before that there was tretyuga 1200000 years thus some 2005000 years ago manu spoke the bhagavadgt to his disciple and son mahrja ikvku the king of this planet earth the age of the current manu is calculated to last some 305300000 years of which 120400000 have passed accepting that before the birth of manu the gt was spoken by the lord to his disciple the sungod vivasvn a rough estimate is that the gt was spoken at least 120400000 years ago and in human society it has been extant for two million years it was respoken by the lord again to arjuna about five thousand years ago that is the rough estimate of the history of the gt according to the gt itself and according to the version of the speaker lord r ka it was spoken to the sungod vivasvn because he is also a katriya and is the father of all katriyas who are descendants of the sungod or the sryavaa katriyas because bhagavadgt is as good as the vedas being spoken by the supreme personality of godhead this knowledge is apaurueya superhuman since the vedic instructions are accepted as they are without human copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved interpretation the gt must therefore be accepted without mundane interpretation the mundane wranglers may speculate on the gt in their own ways but that is not bhagavadgt as it is therefore bhagavadgt has to be accepted as it is from the disciplic succession and it is described herein that the lord spoke to the sungod the sungod spoke to his son manu and manu spoke to his son

clearly stated that the gt was especially meant for the saintly kings because they were to execute its purpose in ruling over the citizens certainly bhagavadgt was never meant for the demonic persons who would dissipate its value for no ones benefit and would devise all types of interpretations according to personal whims as soon as the original purpose was scattered by the motives of the unscrupulous commentators there arose the need to reestablish the disciplic succession five thousand years ago it was detected by the lord himself that the disciplic succession was broken and therefore he declared that the purpose of the gt appeared to be lost in the same way at the present moment also there are so many editions of the gt especially in english but almost all of them are not according to authorized disciplic succession there are innumerable interpretations rendered by different mundane scholars but almost all of them do not accept the supreme personality of godhead ka although they make a good business on the words of r ka this spirit is demonic because demons do not believe in god but simply enjoy the property of the supreme since there is a great need of an edition of the gt in english as it is received by the parampar disciplic succession system an attempt is made herewith to fulfill this great want bhagavadgtaccepted as it isis a great boon to humanity but if it is accepted as a treatise of philosophical speculations it is simply a waste of time text 3 sa wvaya mayaa tae yaaega paae pauratana aaeisa mae saa ceita rhsya etadutamama 3 sa evya may te

demon it is not possible to understand this great mysterious science there are a number of editions of this great book of knowledge some of them have commentaries by the devotees and some of them have commentaries by the demons commentation by the devotees is real whereas that of the demons is useless arjuna accepts r ka as the supreme personality of godhead and any commentary on the gt following in the footsteps of arjuna is real devotional service to the cause of this great science the demonic however do not accept lord ka as he is instead they concoct something about ka and mislead general

the beginning you instructed this science to him purport arjuna is an accepted devotee of the lord so how could he not believe kas words the fact is that arjuna is not inquiring for himself but for those who do not believe in the supreme personality of godhead or for the demons who do not like the idea that ka should be accepted as the supreme personality of godhead for them only arjuna inquires on this point as if he were himself not aware of the personality of godhead or ka as it will be evident from the tenth chapter arjuna knew perfectly well that ka is the supreme personality of godhead the fountainhead of everything and the last word in transcendence of course ka also appeared as the son of devak on this earth how ka remained the same supreme personality of godhead the eternal original person is very difficult for an ordinary man to understand therefore to clarify this point arjuna put this question before ka so that copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved he himself could speak authoritatively that ka is the supreme authority is accepted by the whole world not only at present but from time immemorial and the demons alone reject him anyway since ka is the authority accepted by all arjuna put this question before him in order that ka would describe himself without being depicted by the demons who always try to distort him in a way understandable to the demons and their followers it is necessary that everyone for his own interest know the science of ka therefore when ka himself speaks about himself it is auspicious for all the worlds to the demons such explanations by ka himself may appear to be strange because the demons always study ka from their own standpoint but those who are devotees heartily welcome the statements of ka when they are spoken by ka himself the devotees will always worship such authoritative statements of ka because they are always eager to know more and more about him the atheists who consider ka an ordinary man may in this way come to know that ka is superhuman that he is saccidnandavigraha bs 51the eternal form of bliss and knowledgethat he is transcendental and that he is above the domination of the modes of material nature and above the influence of time and space a devotee of ka like arjuna is undoubtedly above any misunderstanding of the transcendental position of ka arjunas putting this question before the lord is simply an attempt by the devotee to defy the atheistic attitude of persons who consider ka to be an ordinary human being subject to the modes of material nature text 5

infallible without beginning although expanded into unlimited forms he is still the same original the oldest and the person always appearing as a fresh youth such eternal blissful allknowing forms of the lord are usually understood by the best vedic scholars but they are always manifest to pure unalloyed devotees it is also stated in brahmasahit 539 rmdimrtiu kalniyamena tihan nnvatram akarod bhuvaneu kintu ka svaya samabhavat parama pumn yo copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved govindam dipurua tam aha bhajmi i worship the supreme personality of godhead govinda ka who is always situated in various incarnations such as rma nsiha and many subincarnations as well but who is the original personality of godhead known as ka and who incarnates personally also in the vedas also it is said that the lord although one without a second manifests himself in innumerable forms he is like the vaidurya stone which changes color yet still remains one all those multiforms are understood by the pure unalloyed devotees but not by a simple study of the vedas vedeu durlabham adurlabham tmabhaktau devotees like arjuna are constant companions of the lord and whenever the lord incarnates the associate devotees also incarnate in order to serve the lord in different capacities arjuna is one of these devotees and in this verse it is understood that some millions of years ago when lord ka spoke the bhagavadgt to the sungod vivasvn arjuna in a different capacity was also present but the difference between the lord and arjuna is that the lord remembered the incident whereas arjuna could not remember that is the difference between the partandparcel living entity and the supreme lord although arjuna is addressed herein as the mighty hero who could subdue the enemies he is unable to recall what had happened in his various past births therefore a living entity however great he may be in the material estimation can never equal the supreme lord anyone who is a constant companion of the lord is certainly a liberated person but he cannot be equal to the lord the lord is described in the brahmasahit as infallible acyuta which means that he never forgets himself even though he is in material contact therefore the lord and the living entity can never be equal in all respects even if the living entity is as liberated as arjuna although arjuna is a devotee of the lord he sometimes forgets the nature of the lord but by the divine grace a devotee can at once understand the infallible condition of the lord whereas a nondevotee or a demon cannot understand this transcendental nature consequently these descriptions in the gt cannot be understood by demonic brains ka remembered acts which were performed by him millions of years before but arjuna could not despite the fact that both ka and arjuna are eternal in copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved nature we may also note herein that a living entity forgets everything due to his change of body but the lord remembers because he does not change his saccidnanda body he is advaita which means there is no distinction between his body and himself everything in relation to him is spiritwhereas the conditioned soul is different from his material body and because the lords body and self are identical his position is always different from that of the ordinary living entity even when he descends to the material platform the demons cannot adjust themselves to this transcendental nature of the lord which the lord himself explains in the following verse text 6 ajaaeipa savyayaatmaa autaanaamaqraeipa sana pakita svamaidaaya samavamyaatmamaayayaa 6 ajo pi sann avyaytm bhtnm varo pi san prakti svm adhihya sambhavmy tmamyay synonyms

adhihyabeing so situated sambhavmii do incarnate tmamyayby my internal energy translation although i am unborn and my transcendental body never deteriorates and although i am the lord of all living entities i still appear in every millennium in my original transcendental form copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved purport the lord has spoken about the peculiarity of his birth although he may appear like an ordinary person he remembers everything of his many many past births whereas a common man cannot remember what he has done even a few hours before if someone is asked what he did exactly at the same time one day earlier it would be very difficult for a common man to answer immediately he would surely have to dredge his memory to recall what he was doing exactly at the same time one day before and yet men often dare claim to be god or ka one should not be misled by such meaningless claims then again the lord explains his prakti or his form prakti means nature as well as svarpa or ones own form the lord says that he appears in his own body he does not change his body as the common living entity changes from one body to another the conditioned soul may have one kind of body in the present birth but he has a different body in the next birth in the material world the living entity has no fixed body but transmigrates from one body to another the lord however does not do so whenever he appears he does so in the same original body by his internal potency in other words ka appears in this material world in his original eternal form with two hands holding a flute he appears exactly in his eternal body uncontaminated by this material world although he appears in the same transcendental body and is lord of the universe it still appears that he takes his birth like an ordinary living entity and although his body does not deteriorate like a material body it still appears that lord ka grows from childhood to boyhood and from boyhood to youth but astonishingly enough he never ages beyond youth at the time of the battle of kuruketra he had many grandchildren at home or in other words he had sufficiently aged by material calculations still he looked just like a young man twenty or twentyfive years old we never see a picture of ka in old age because he never grows old like us although he is the oldest person in the whole creationpast present and future neither his body nor his intelligence ever deteriorates or changes therefore it is clear that in spite of his being in the material world he is the same unborn eternal form of bliss and knowledge changeless in his transcendental body and copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved intelligence factually his appearance and disappearance is like the suns rising moving before us and then disappearing from our eyesight when the sun is out of sight we think that the sun is set and when the sun is before our eyes we think that the sun is on the horizon actually the sun is always in its fixed position but owing to our defective insufficient senses we calculate the appearance and disappearance of the sun in the sky and because lord kas appearance and disappearance are completely different from that of any ordinary common living entity it is evident that he is eternal blissful knowledge by his internal potencyand he is never contaminated by material nature the vedas also confirm that the supreme personality of godhead is unborn yet he still appears to take his birth in multimanifestations the vedic supplementary literatures also confirm that even though the lord appears to be taking his birth he is still without change of body in the bhgavatam he appears before his mother as nryaa with four hands and the decorations of the six kinds of full opulences his appearance in his original eternal form is his causeless mercy bestowed upon the living entities so that they can concentrate on the supreme lord as he is and not on mental concoctions or imaginations which the impersonalist wrongly thinks the lords forms to be the word my or tmamy refers to the lords causeless mercy according to the vivakoa dictionary the lord is conscious of all of his previous appearances and disappearances but a common living entity forgets everything about his past body as soon as he gets another body he is the lord of all living entities because he performs wonderful and superhuman activities while he is on this earth therefore the lord is always the same absolute truth and is without differentiation between his form and self or between his quality and body a question may now be raised as to why the lord appears and disappears in this world this is explained in the next verse text 7 yada yada ih damarsya

time i descend myself purport the word sjmi is significant herein sjmi cannot be used in the sense of creation because according to the previous verse there is no creation of the lords form or body since all of the forms are eternally existent therefore sjmi means that the lord manifests himself as he is although the lord appears on schedule namely at the end of the dvparayuga of the twentyeighth millennium of the seventh manu in one day of brahm he has no obligation to adhere to such rules and regulations because he is completely free to act in many ways at his will he therefore appears by his own will whenever there is a predominance of irreligiosity and a disappearance of true religion principles of religion are laid down in the vedas and any discrepancy in the matter of properly executing the rules of the vedas makes one irreligious in the bhgavatam it is stated that such principles are the laws of copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved the lord only the lord can manufacture a system of religion the vedas are also accepted as originally spoken by the lord himself to brahm from within his heart therefore the principles of dharma or religion are the direct orders of the supreme personality of godhead dharma tu skd bhagavatpratam sb 6319 these principles are clearly indicated throughout the bhagavadgt the purpose of the vedas is to establish such principles under the order of the supreme lord and the lord directly orders at the end of the gt that the highest principle of religion is to surrender unto him only and nothing more the vedic principles push one towards complete surrender unto him and whenever such principles are disturbed by the demoniac the lord appears from the bhgavatam we understand that lord buddha is the incarnation of ka who appeared when materialism was rampant and materialists were using the pretext of the authority of the vedas although there are certain restrictive rules and regulations regarding animal sacrifice for particular purposes in the vedas people of demonic tendency still took to animal sacrifice without reference to the vedic principles lord buddha appeared to stop this nonsense and to establish the vedic principles of nonviolence therefore each and every avatra or incarnation of the lord has a particular mission and they are all described in the revealed scriptures no one should be accepted as an avatra unless he is referred to by scriptures it is not a fact that the lord appears only on indian soil he can manifest himself anywhere and everywhere and whenever he desires to appear in each and every incarnation he speaks as much about religion as can be understood by the particular people under their particular circumstances but the mission is the sameto lead people to god consciousness and obedience to the principles of religion sometimes he descends personally and sometimes he sends his bona fide representative in the form of his son or servant or himself in some disguised form the principles of the bhagavadgt were spoken to arjuna and for that matter to other highly elevated persons because he was highly advanced compared to ordinary persons in other parts of the world two plus two equals four is a mathematical principle that is true in the beginners arithmetic class and in the advanced class as well still there are higher and lower copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved mathematics in all incarnations of the lord therefore the same principles are taught but they appear to be higher and lower in varied circumstances the higher principles of religion begin with the acceptance of the four orders and the four statuses of social life as will be explained later the whole purpose of the mission of incarnations is to arouse ka consciousness everywhere such consciousness is manifest and nonmanifest only under different circumstances text 8 pairaaaaya saadaunaa ivnaaxaaya c duzktaama damarsasqaapanaaqaarya samavaima

but if he has the copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved qualifications of ka consciousness wholly and fully he is to be understood to be a sdhu and duktm applies to those who do not care for ka consciousness such miscreants or duktm are described as foolish and the lowest of mankind even though they may be decorated with mundane education whereas a person who is one hundred percent engaged in ka consciousness is accepted as a sdhu even though such a person may be neither learned nor well cultured as far as the atheistic are concerned it is not necessary for the supreme lord to appear as he is to destroy them as he did with the demons rvaa and kasa the lord has many agents who are quite competent to vanquish demons but the lord especially descends to appease his unalloyed devotees who are always harassed by the demoniac the demon harasses the devotee even though the latter may happen to be his kin although prahlda mahrja was the son of hirayakaipu he was nonetheless persecuted by his father although devak the mother of ka was the sister of kasa she and her husband vasudeva were persecuted only because ka was to be born of them so lord ka appeared primarily to deliver devak rather than kill kasa but both were performed simultaneously therefore it is said here that to deliver the devotee and vanquish the demon miscreants the lord appears in different incarnations in the caitanyacaritmta of kadsa kavirja the following verses madhya 20263264 summarize these principles of incarnation sihetu yei mrti prapace avatare sei varamrti avatra nma dhare mytta paravyome sabra avasthna vive avatari dhare avatra nma the avatra or incarnation of godhead descends from the kingdom of god for material manifestation and the particular form of the personality of godhead who so descends is called an incarnation or avatra such incarnations are situated in the spiritual world the kingdom of god when they descend to the material creation they assume the name avatra there are various kinds of avatras such as puruvatras guvatras llvatras aktyvea avatras manvantaraavatras and yugvatrasall copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved appearing on schedule all over the universe but lord ka is the primeval lord the fountainhead of all avatras lord r ka descends for the specific purpose of mitigating the anxieties of the pure devotees who are very anxious to see him in his original vndvana pastimes therefore the prime purpose of the ka avatra is to satisfy his unalloyed devotees the lord says that he incarnates himself in every millennium this indicates that he incarnates also in the age of kali as stated in the rmadbhgavatam the incarnation in the age of kali is lord caitanya mahprabhu who spread the worship of ka by the sakrtana movement congregational chanting of the holy names and spread ka consciousness throughout india he predicted that this culture of sakrtana would be broadcast all over the world from town to town and village to village lord caitanya as the incarnation of ka the personality of godhead is described secretly but not directly in the confidential parts of the revealed scriptures such as the upaniads mahbhrata and bhgavatam the devotees of lord ka are very much attracted by the sakrtana movement of lord caitanya this avatra of the lord does not kill the miscreants but delivers them by his causeless mercy text 9 janma kmar c mae idvyamaev yaae veita tatvta tyaa deh paunajarnma naeita maamaeita saaejaurna 9 janma karma ca me divyam eva yo vetti tattvata tyaktv

his transcendental abode is already explained in the 6th verse one who can understand the truth of the appearance of the personality of godhead is already liberated from material bondage and therefore he returns to the kingdom of god immediately after quitting this present material body such liberation of the living entity from material bondage is not at all easy the impersonalists and the yogs attain liberation only after much trouble and many many births even then the liberation they achievemerging into the impersonal brahmajyoti of the lordis only partial and there is the risk of returning to this material world but the devotee simply by understanding the transcendental nature of the body and activities of the lord attains the abode of the lord after ending this body and does not run the risk of returning to this material world in the brahmasahit 533 it is stated that the lord has many many forms and incarnations advaitam acyutam andim anantarpam although there are many transcendental forms of the lord they are still one and the same supreme personality of godhead one has to understand this fact with conviction although it is incomprehensible to mundane scholars and empiric philosophers as stated in the vedas puruabodhin upaniad eko devo nityallnurakto bhaktavyp hdy antartm the one supreme personality of godhead is eternally engaged in many copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved many transcendental forms in relationships with his unalloyed devotees this vedic version is confirmed in this verse of the gt personally by the lord he who accepts this truth on the strength of the authority of the vedas and of the supreme personality of godhead and who does not waste time in philosophical speculations attains the highest perfectional stage of liberation simply by accepting this truth on faith one can without a doubt attain liberation the vedic version tat tvam asi is actually applied in this case anyone who understands lord ka to be the supreme or who says unto the lord you are the same supreme brahman the personality of godhead is certainly liberated instantly and consequently his entrance into the transcendental association of the lord is guaranteed in other words such a faithful devotee of the lord attains perfection and this is confirmed by the following vedic assertion tam eva viditvti mtyum eti nnya panth vidyate yanya one can attain the perfect stage of liberation from birth and death simply by knowing the lord the supreme personality of godhead and there is no other way to achieve this perfection vetvatara upaniad 38 that there is no alternative means that anyone who does not understand lord ka as the supreme personality of godhead is surely in the mode of ignorance and consequently he will not attain salvation simply so to speak by licking the outer surface of the bottle of honey or by interpreting the bhagavadgt according to mundane scholarship such empiric philosophers may assume very important roles in the material world but they are not necessarily eligible for liberation such puffedup mundane scholars have to wait for the causeless mercy of the devotee of the lord one should therefore cultivate ka consciousness with faith and knowledge and in this way attain perfection text 10 vqtaragaayaaedaa manmayaa maamaupaaitaa copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust

purport as described above it is very difficult for a person who is too materially affected to understand the personal nature of the supreme absolute truth generally people who are attached to the bodily conception of life are so absorbed in materialism that it is almost impossible for them to understand how the supreme can be a person such materialists cannot even imagine that there is a transcendental body which is imperishable full of knowledge and eternally blissful in the materialistic concept the body is perishable full of ignorance and completely miserable therefore people in general keep this same bodily idea in mind when they are informed of the personal form of the lord for such materialistic men the form of the gigantic material manifestation is supreme consequently they consider the supreme to be impersonal and because they are too materially absorbed the conception of copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved retaining the personality after liberation from matter frightens them when they are informed that spiritual life is also individual and personal they become afraid of becoming persons again and so they naturally prefer a kind of merging into the impersonal void generally they compare the living entities to the bubbles of the ocean which merge into the ocean that is the highest perfection of spiritual existence attainable without individual personality this is a kind of fearful stage of life devoid of perfect knowledge of spiritual existence furthermore there are many persons who cannot understand spiritual existence at all being embarrassed by so many theories and by contradictions of various types of philosophical speculation they become disgusted or angry and foolishly conclude that there is no supreme cause and that everything is ultimately void such people are in a diseased condition of life some people are too materially attached and therefore do not give attention to spiritual life some of them want to merge into the supreme spiritual cause and some of them disbelieve in everything being angry at all sorts of spiritual speculation out of hopelessness this last class of men take to the shelter of some kind of intoxication and their affective hallucinations are sometimes accepted as spiritual vision one has to get rid of all three stages of attachment to the material world negligence of spiritual life fear of a spiritual personal identity and the conception of void that arises from frustration in life to get free from these three stages of the material concept of life one has to take complete shelter of the lord guided by the bona fide spiritual master and follow the disciplines and regulative principles of devotional life the last stage of the devotional life is called bhva or transcendental love of godhead according to bhaktirasmtasindhu 141516 the science of devotional service dau raddh tata sdhusago tha bhajanakriy tato narthanivtti syt tato nih rucis tata athsaktis tato

selfrealization this will bring one to the stage of trying to associate with persons who are spiritually elevated in the next stage one becomes initiated by an elevated spiritual master and under his instruction the neophyte devotee begins the process of devotional service by execution of devotional service under the guidance of the spiritual master one becomes free from all material attachment attains steadiness in selfrealization and acquires a taste for hearing about the absolute personality of godhead r ka this taste leads one further forward to attachment for ka consciousness which is matured in bhva or the preliminary stage of transcendental love of god real love for god is called prema the highest perfectional stage of life in the prema stage there is constant engagement in the transcendental loving service of the lord so by the slow process of devotional service under the guidance of the bona fide spiritual master one can attain the highest stage being freed from all material attachment from the fearfulness of ones individual spiritual personality and from the frustrations that result in void philosophy then one can ultimately attain to the abode of the supreme

devotee may want ka as supreme master another as his personal friend another as his son and still another as his lover ka rewards all the devotees equally according to their different intensities of love for him in the material world the same reciprocations of feelings are there and they are equally exchanged by the lord with the different types of worshipers the pure devotees both here and in the transcendental abode associate with him in person and are able to render personal service to the lord and thus derive transcendental bliss in his loving service as for those who are impersonalists and who want to commit spiritual suicide by annihilating the individual existence of the living entity ka helps also by absorbing them into his effulgence such impersonalists do not agree to accept the eternal blissful personality of godhead consequently they cannot relish the bliss of transcendental personal service to the lord having extinguished their individuality some of them who are not firmly situated even in the impersonal existence return to this material field to exhibit their dormant copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved desires for activities they are not admitted into the spiritual planets but they are again given a chance to act on the material planets for those who are fruitive workers the lord awards the desired results of their prescribed

worlds and their inhabitants including the demigods and their worshipers are bubbles in the cosmic ocean in this world however human society is mad after temporary things such as the material opulence of possessing land family and enjoyable paraphernalia to achieve such temporary things people worship the demigods or powerful men in human society if a man gets some ministership in the government by worshiping a political leader he considers that he has achieved a great boon all of them are therefore kowtowing to the socalled leaders or big guns in order to achieve temporary boons and they indeed achieve such things such foolish men are not interested in ka consciousness for the permanent solution to the hardships of material existence they are all after sense enjoyment and to get a little facility for sense enjoyment they are attracted to worship empowered living entities known as demigods this verse indicates that people are rarely interested in ka consciousness they are mostly

bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved as there are constitutional laws in the material world stating that the king can do no wrong or that the king is not subject to the state laws similarly the lord although he is the creator of this material world is not affected by the activities of the material world he creates and remains aloof from the creation whereas the living entities are entangled in the fruitive results of material activities because of their propensity for lording it over material resources the proprietor of an establishment is not responsible for the right and wrong activities of the workers but the workers are themselves responsible the living entities are engaged in their respective activities of sense gratification and these activities are not ordained by the lord for advancement of sense gratification the living entities are engaged in the work of this world and they aspire to heavenly happiness after death the lord being full in himself has no attraction for socalled heavenly happiness the heavenly demigods are only his engaged servants the proprietor never desires the lowgrade happiness such as the workers may desire he is aloof from the material actions and reactions for example the rains are not responsible for different types of vegetation that appear on the earth although without such rains there is no possibility of vegetative growth vedic smti confirms this fact as follows nimittamtram evsau sjyn sargakarmai pradhnakrabht yato vai sjyaaktaya in the material creations the lord is only the supreme cause the immediate cause is material nature by which the cosmic manifestation is made visible the created beings are of many varieties such as the demigods human beings and lower animals and all of them are subject to the

intricacies of this law of karma or fruitive activities does not become affected by the results of his activities in other words the person who understands this transcendental nature of the lord is an experienced man in ka consciousness and thus he is never subjected to the laws of karma one who does not know the transcendental nature of the lord and who thinks that the activities of the lord are aimed at fruitive results as are the activities of the ordinary living entities certainly becomes entangled himself in fruitive reactions but one who knows the supreme truth is a liberated soul fixed

and to sit aloof making a show of ka consciousness is less important than actually engaging in the field of activities for the sake of ka arjuna is here advised to act in ka consciousness following in the footsteps of the lords previous disciples such as the sungod vivasvn as mentioned hereinbefore the supreme lord knows all his past activities as well as those of persons who acted in ka

text to follow to act in ka consciousness one has to follow the leadership of authorized persons who are in a line of disciplic succession as explained in the beginning of this chapter the system of ka consciousness was first narrated to the sungod the sungod explained it to his son manu manu explained it to his son ikvku and the system is current on this earth from that very remote time therefore one has to follow in the footsteps of previous authorities in the line of disciplic succession otherwise even the most intelligent men will be bewildered regarding the standard actions of ka consciousness for this reason the lord decided to instruct arjuna in ka consciousness directly because of the direct instruction of the lord to arjuna anyone who follows in the footsteps of arjuna is certainly not bewildered it is said that one cannot ascertain the ways of religion simply by imperfect copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved experimental knowledge actually the principles of religion can only be laid down by the lord himself dharma tu skd bhagavatpratam bhg 6319 no one can manufacture a religious principle by imperfect speculation one must

of the lord and that consequently one has to act in ka consciousness the entire bhagavadgt is directed toward this conclusion any other conclusions against this consciousness and its attendant actions

spiritual goal is described here there are various activities in ka consciousness and all of them will be described in the following verses but for the present just the principle of ka consciousness is described a conditioned soul entangled in material contamination is sure to act in the material atmosphere and yet he has to get out of such an environment the process by which the conditioned soul can get out of the material atmosphere is ka consciousness for example a patient who is suffering from a disorder of the bowels due to overindulgence in milk products is cured by another milk product

varieties of sacrifice can be placed within two primary divisions namely sacrifice of worldly possessions and sacrifice in pursuit of transcendental knowledge those who are in ka consciousness sacrifice all material possessions for the satisfaction of the supreme lord while others who want some temporary material happiness sacrifice their material possessions to satisfy demigods such as indra the sungod etc and others who are impersonalists sacrifice their identity by merging into the existence of impersonal brahman the demigods are powerful living entities appointed by the supreme lord for the maintenance and supervision of all material functions like the heating watering and lighting of the universe those who are interested in material benefits worship the demigods by various sacrifices according to the vedic rituals they are called bahvvaravd or believers in many gods but others who worship the impersonal feature of the absolute truth and regard the forms of the demigods as temporary sacrifice their individual selves in the supreme fire and thus end their individual existences by merging into the existence of the supreme such impersonalists sacrifice their time in philosophical speculation to understand the transcendental nature of the supreme in other words the fruitive workers sacrifice their material possessions for material enjoyment whereas the impersonalist sacrifices his material designations with a view to merging into the existence of the supreme for the impersonalist the fire altar of sacrifice is the supreme brahman and the offering is the self being consumed by the fire of brahman the ka conscious person like arjuna however sacrifices everything for the satisfaction of ka and thus all his material possessions as well as his own

soul is called pratyagtm and pargtm as long as the soul is attached to sense enjoyment it is called pargtm but as soon as the same soul becomes detached from such sense enjoyment it is called pratyagtm the soul is subjected to the functions of ten kinds of air at work within the body and this is perceived through the breathing system the patajali system of yoga instructs one on how to control the functions of the bodys air in a technical manner so that ultimately all the functions of the air within become favorable for purifying the soul of material attachment according to this yoga system pratyagtm is the ultimate goal this pratyagtm is withdrawn from activities in matter the senses interact with the sense objects like the ear for hearing eyes for seeing nose for smelling tongue for tasting hand for touching and all of them are thus engaged in activities outside the self they are called the functions of the pravyu the apnavyu goes downwards vynavyu acts to shrink and

various divisions there are persons who are sacrificing their possessions in the form of various kinds of charities in india the rich mercantile community or princely orders open various kinds of charitable institutions like dharmal annaketra atithil anthlaya and vidypha in other countries too there are many hospitals old age homes and similar charitable foundations meant for distributing food education and medical treatment free to the poor all these charitable activities are called dravyamayayaja there are others who for higher elevation in life or for promotion to higher planets within the universe voluntarily accept many kinds of austerities such as candryaa and cturmsya these processes entail severe vows for conducting life under certain rigid rules for example under the cturmsya vow the candidate does not shave for four months during the year july to october he does not eat certain foods does not eat twice in a day or does not leave home such sacrifice of the comforts of life is called tapomayayaja there are still others who engage themselves in different kinds of mystic yogas like the patajali system for merging into the existence of the absolute or hahayoga or agayoga for particular perfections and some travel to all the sanctified places of pilgrimage all these practices are called yogayaja sacrifice for a certain type of perfection in the material world there are

all of these processes are recommended for controlling the senses and for advancement in spiritual realization this practice involves controlling the airs within the body so as to reverse the

duration of life by many many years a ka conscious person however being always situated in the transcendental loving service of the lord automatically becomes the controller of the senses his senses being always engaged in the service of ka have no chance of becoming otherwise engaged so at the end of life he is naturally transferred to the transcendental plane of lord ka consequently he makes no

pointing out the paths of religion economic comfort regulated sense gratification and at last the means to get out of the miserable condition entirely the path of religion or the different kinds of sacrifice recommended above automatically solves our economic problems by performance of yaja we can have enough food enough milk etceven if there is a socalled increase of population when the body is fully supplied naturally the next stage is to satisfy the senses the vedas prescribe therefore sacred marriage for regulated sense gratification thereby one is gradually elevated to the platform of release from material bondage and the highest perfection of liberated life is to associate with the supreme lord perfection is achieved by performance of yaja sacrifice as described above now if a person is not inclined to perform yaja according to the vedas how can he expect a happy life even in this body and what to speak of another body on another planet there are different grades of material comforts in different heavenly planets and in all cases there is immense happiness for persons engaged in different kinds of yaja but the highest kind of happiness that a man can achieve is

person in the disciplic succession can convey the message of the lord as it is to his disciple no one can be spiritually realized by manufacturing his own process as is the fashion of the foolish pretenders the bhgavatam 6319 says dharma tu skd bhagavatpratam the path of religion is directly enunciated by the lord therefore mental speculation or dry arguments cannot help lead one to the right path nor by independent study of books of knowledge can one progress in spiritual life one has to approach a bona fide spiritual master to receive the knowledge such a spiritual master should be accepted in full surrender and one should serve the spiritual master like a menial servant without false prestige satisfaction of the selfrealized spiritual master is the secret of advancement in spiritual life inquiries and submission constitute the proper combination for spiritual understanding unless there is submission and service inquiries from the learned spiritual master will not be effective one must be able to pass the test of the spiritual master and when he sees the genuine desire of the disciple he automatically blesses the disciple with genuine spiritual understanding in this verse both blind following and absurd inquiries are condemned not only should one hear submissively from the spiritual master but one must also get a clear understanding from him in submission and service and inquiries a bona fide spiritual master is by nature very kind toward the disciple therefore when the student is submissive and is always ready to render service the reciprocation of

existence separate from ka is called my mnot ythis some think that we have nothing to do with ka that ka is only a great historical personality and that the absolute is the impersonal brahman factually as it is stated in the bhagavadgt this impersonal brahman is the personal effulgence of ka ka as the supreme personality of godhead is the cause of everything in the brahmasahit it is clearly stated that ka is the supreme personality of godhead the cause of all causes even the millions of incarnations are only his different expansions similarly the living entities are also expansions of ka the myvd philosophers wrongly think that ka loses his own separate existence in his many expansions this thought is material in nature we have experience in the material world that a thing when fragmentally distributed loses its own original identity but the myvd philosophers fail to understand that absolute means that one plus one is equal to one and that one minus one is also equal to one this is the case in the absolute world copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved for want of sufficient knowledge in the absolute science we are now covered with illusion and therefore we think that we are separate from ka although we are separated parts of ka we are nevertheless not different from him the bodily difference of the living entities is my or not actual fact we are all meant to satisfy ka by my alone arjuna thought that the temporary bodily relationship with his kinsmen was more important than his eternal spiritual relationship with ka the whole teaching of the gt is targeted toward this end that a living being as kas eternal servitor cannot be separated from ka and his sense of being an identity apart from ka is called my the living entities as separate parts and parcels of the supreme have a purpose to fulfill having forgotten that purpose since time immemorial they are situated in different bodies as men animals demigods etc such bodily differences arise from forgetfulness of the transcendental service of the lord but when one is engaged in transcendental service through ka consciousness one becomes at once liberated from this illusion one can acquire such pure knowledge only from the bona fide spiritual master and thereby avoid the delusion that the living entity is equal to ka perfect knowledge is that the supreme soul ka is the supreme shelter for all living entities and giving up such shelter the living entities are deluded by the material energy imagining themselves to have a separate identity thus under different standards of material identity they become forgetful of ka when however such deluded living entities become situated in ka consciousness it is to be understood that they are on the path of liberation as confirmed in the bhgavatam 2106 muktir hitvnyathrpa svarpea vyavasthiti liberation means to be situated in ones constitutional position as an eternal servitor of ka ka consciousness text

performed by the living entity this yoga has two divisions of sacrificial actions one is called sacrifice of ones material possessions and the other is called knowledge of self which is pure spiritual activity if sacrifice of ones material possessions is not dovetailed for spiritual realization then such sacrifice becomes material but one who performs such sacrifices with a spiritual objective or in devotional service makes a perfect sacrifice when we come to spiritual activities we find that these are also divided into two namely understanding of ones own self or ones constitutional position and the truth regarding the supreme personality of godhead one who follows the path of bhagavadgt as it is can very easily understand these two important divisions of spiritual knowledge for him there is no difficulty in obtaining perfect knowledge of the self as part and parcel of the lord and such understanding is beneficial for such a person can easily understand the transcendental activities of the lord in the beginning of this chapter the transcendental activities of the lord were discussed by the supreme lord himself one who does not understand the instructions of the gt is faithless and is to be considered to be misusing the fragmental independence awarded to him by the lord in spite of such instructions one who does not understand the real nature of the lord as the eternal blissful allknowing personality of godhead is certainly fool number one ignorance can be removed by gradual acceptance of the principles of ka consciousness ka consciousness is awakened by different types of sacrifices to the demigods sacrifice to brahman sacrifice in celibacy in household life in controlling the senses in practicing mystic yoga in penance in forgoing material possessions in studying the vedas and in partaking of the social institution called varramadharma all of these are known as sacrifice and all of them are based on regulated action but within all these activities the important factor is selfrealization one who seeks that objective is the real student of bhagavadgt but one who doubts the authority of ka falls back one is therefore advised to study bhagavadgt or any other scripture under a bona fide spiritual master with service and surrender a bona fide spiritual master is in the disciplic succession from time eternal and he does not deviate at all copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved from the instructions of the supreme lord as they were imparted millions of years ago to the sungod from whom the instructions of bhagavadgt have come down to the earthly kingdom one should therefore follow the path of bhagavadgt as it is expressed in the gt itself and beware of selfinterested people after personal aggrandizement who deviate others from the actual path the lord is definitely the supreme person and his activities are transcendental one who understands this is a liberated person from the very beginning of his study of bhagavadgt

soul and its entanglement in the material body were explained how to get out of this material encagement by buddhiyoga or devotional service was also explained therein in the third chapter it was explained that a person who is situated on the platform of knowledge no longer has any duties to perform and in the fourth chapter the lord told arjuna that all kinds of sacrificial work culminate in knowledge however at the end of the fourth chapter the lord advised arjuna to wake up and fight being situated in perfect knowledge therefore by simultaneously stressing the importance of both work in

his real identity he has to work for fruitive results for sense gratification and as long as one is engrossed in the consciousness of sense gratification one has to transmigrate from one body to another although the mind may be engrossed in fruitive activities and influenced by ignorance one must develop a love for devotional service to vsudeva only then can one have the opportunity to get out of the bondage of material existence therefore jna or knowledge that one is not this material body but spirit soul is not sufficient for liberation one has to act in the status of spirit soul copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved otherwise there is no escape from material bondage action in ka consciousness is not however action on the fruitive platform activities performed in full knowledge strengthen ones advancement in real knowledge without ka consciousness mere renunciation of fruitive activities does not actually purify the heart of a conditioned soul as long as the heart is not purified one has to work on the fruitive platform but action in ka consciousness automatically helps one escape the result of fruitive action so that one need not descend to the material platform therefore action in ka consciousness is always superior to renunciation which always entails a risk of falling renunciation without ka consciousness is incomplete as is confirmed by rla rpa gosvm in his bhaktirasmtasindhu 12258 prpacikatay buddhy harisambandhivastuna mumukubhi paritygo vairgya phalgu kathyate when persons eager to achieve liberation renounce things related to the supreme personality of godhead thinking them to be material their renunciation is called incomplete renunciation is complete when it is in the knowledge that everything

the students of the bhgavata school are engaged in the devotional service of the lord according to pcartrik regulations and therefore the vaiava sannyss have multiple engagements in the transcendental service of the lord the vaiava sannyss have nothing to do with material activities and yet they perform various activities in their devotional service to the lord but the myvd sannyss engaged in the studies of skhya and vednta and speculation cannot relish the transcendental service of the lord because their studies become very tedious they sometimes become tired of brahman speculation and thus they take shelter of the bhgavatam without proper understanding consequently their study of the rmadbhgavatam becomes troublesome dry speculations and impersonal interpretations by artificial means are all useless for the myvd sannyss the vaiava sannyss who are engaged in devotional service are happy in the discharge of their transcendental duties and they have the guarantee of ultimate entrance

bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved bewildered by ignorance desires to be put into certain conditions of life and thereby his chain of action and reaction begins a living entity is by superior nature full of knowledge nevertheless he is prone to be influenced by ignorance due to his limited power the lord is omnipotent but the living entity is not the lord is vibhu or omniscient but the living entity is au or atomic because he is a living soul he has the capacity to desire by his free will such desire is fulfilled only by the omnipotent lord and so when the living entity is bewildered in his desires the lord allows him to fulfill those desires but the lord is never responsible for the actions and reactions of the particular situation which may be desired being in a bewildered condition therefore the embodied soul identifies himself with the circumstantial material body and becomes subjected to the temporary misery and happiness of life the lord is the constant companion of the living entity as paramtm or the supersoul and therefore he can understand the desires of the individual soul as one can smell the flavor of a flower by being near it desire is a subtle form of conditioning for the living entity the lord fulfills his desire as he deserves man proposes and god disposes the individual is not therefore omnipotent in fulfilling his desires the lord however can fulfill all desires and the lord being neutral to everyone does not interfere with the desires of the minute independent living entities however when one desires ka the lord takes special care and encourages one to desire in such a way that one can attain to him and be eternally happy the vedic hymns therefore declare ea u hy eva sdhu karma krayati ta yam ebhyo lokebhya

ka consciousness causes his own bewilderment consequently although he is constitutionally eternal blissful and cognizant due to the littleness of his existence he forgets his constitutional position of service to the lord and is thus entrapped by nescience and under the spell of ignorance the living entity claims that the lord is responsible for his conditional existence the vedntastras 2134 also

highly esteemed and what is that knowledge perfect knowledge is achieved when one surrenders unto ka as is said in the seventh chapter 19th verse bahn janmanm ante jnavn m prapadyate after passing through many many births when one perfect in knowledge surrenders unto ka or when one attains ka consciousness then everything is revealed to him as everything is revealed by the sun in the daytime the living entity is bewildered in so many ways for instance when he unceremoniously thinks himself god he actually falls into the last snare of nescience if a living entity is god then how can he become bewildered by nescience does god become bewildered by nescience if so then nescience or satan is greater than god real knowledge can be obtained from a person who is in perfect ka consciousness therefore one has to seek out such a bona fide spiritual master and under him learn what ka consciousness is for ka consciousness will certainly drive away all nescience as the sun drives away darkness even though a person may be in full knowledge that he is not this body but is transcendental to the body he still may not be able to discriminate between the soul and the supersoul however he can know everything well if he cares to take shelter of the perfect bona fide ka conscious spiritual master one can know god and ones relationship with god only when one actually meets a representative of god a representative of god never claims that he is god although he is paid all the respect ordinarily paid to god because he has knowledge of god one has to learn the distinction between god and the living entity lord r ka therefore stated in the second chapter 212 that every living being is individual and that the lord also is individual they were all individuals in the past they are individuals at present and they will continue to be individuals in the future even after liberation at night we see everything as one in the darkness but in day when the sun is up we see

transcendentalist this is due to their relationship to the supreme for the supreme lord by his plenary portion as paramtm is present in everyones heart such an understanding of the supreme is real knowledge as far as the bodies are concerned in different castes or different species of life the lord is equally kind to everyone because he treats every living being as a friend yet maintains himself as paramtm regardless of the circumstances of the living entities the lord as paramtm is present both in the outcaste and in the brhmaa although the body of a brhmaa and that of an outcaste are not the same the bodies are material productions of different modes of material nature but the soul and the supersoul within the body are of the same spiritual quality the similarity in the quality of the soul and the supersoul however does not make them equal in quantity for the individual soul is present only in that particular body whereas the paramtm is present in each and every body a ka conscious person has full knowledge of this and therefore he is truly learned and has equal vision the similar characteristics of the soul and supersoul are that they are both conscious eternal

consciousness one can immediately understand ones spiritual identity and then one can understand the supreme lord by means of devotional service when one is well situated in devotional service one comes to the transcendental position qualified to feel the presence of the lord in the sphere of ones activity this particular position is called liberation in the supreme after explaining the above principles of liberation in the supreme the lord gives instruction to arjuna as to how one can come to that position by the practice of the mysticism or yoga known as agayoga which is divisible into an eightfold procedure called yama niyama sana pryma pratyhra dhra dhyna and samdhi in the sixth chapter the subject of yoga is explicitly detailed and at the end of the fifth it is only preliminarily explained one has to drive out the sense objects such as sound touch form taste and smell by the pratyhra process in yoga and then keep the vision of the eyes between the two eyebrows and concentrate on the tip of the nose with halfclosed lids there is no benefit in closing the eyes altogether because then there is every chance of falling asleep nor is there benefit in opening the copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved eyes completely because then there is the hazard of being attracted by sense objects the breathing movement is restrained within the nostrils by neutralizing the upmoving and downmoving air within the body by practice of such yoga one is able to gain control over the senses refrain from outward sense objects and thus prepare oneself for liberation in the supreme this yoga process helps one become free from all kinds of fear and anger and thus feel the presence of the supersoul in the transcendental situation in other words ka consciousness is the easiest process of executing yoga principles this will be thoroughly explained in the next chapter a ka conscious person however being always engaged in devotional service does not risk losing his senses to some other engagement this is a better way of controlling the senses than by the agayoga text 29 aaear yajtapasaa savrlaekmaherma saud savrautaanaa jatva maa

are all anxious to attain peace in the material world but they do not know the formula for peace which is explained in this part of the bhagavadgt the greatest peace formula is simply this lord ka is the beneficiary in all human activities men should offer everything to the transcendental service of the lord because he is the proprietor of all planets and the demigods thereon no one is greater than he he is greater than the greatest of the demigods lord iva and lord brahm in the vedas vetvatara upaniad 67 the supreme lord is described as tam var parama mahevara under the spell of illusion living entities are trying to be lords of all they survey but actually they are dominated by the material energy of the lord the lord is the master of material nature and the conditioned souls are under the stringent rules of material nature unless one understands these bare facts it is not possible to achieve peace in the world either individually or collectively this is the sense of ka consciousness lord ka is the supreme predominator and all living entities including the great demigods are his subordinates one can attain perfect peace only in complete ka consciousness this fifth chapter is a practical explanation of ka consciousness generally known as karmayoga the question of mental speculation as to how karmayoga can give liberation is answered herewith to work in ka consciousness is to work with the complete knowledge of the lord as the predominator such work is not different from transcendental knowledge direct ka consciousness is bhaktiyoga and jnayoga is a path leading to bhaktiyoga ka consciousness means to work in full knowledge of ones relationship with the supreme absolute and the perfection of this consciousness is full knowledge of ka or the supreme personality of godhead a pure soul is the eternal servant of god as his fragmental part and copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved parcel he comes into contact with my illusion due to the desire to lord it over my and that is the cause of his many sufferings as long as he is in contact with matter he has to execute work in terms of material necessities ka consciousness however brings one into spiritual life even while one is within the jurisdiction of matter for it is an arousing of spiritual existence by practice in the material world the more one is advanced the more he is freed from the clutches of matter the lord is not partial toward anyone everything depends on ones practical performance of duties in ka consciousness which helps one control the senses in every respect and conquer the influence of desire and anger and one who stands fast in ka consciousness controlling the abovementioned passions remains factually in the transcendental stage or brahmanirva the eightfold yoga mysticism is automatically practiced in ka consciousness because the ultimate purpose is served there is a gradual process of elevation in the practice of yama niyama sana pryma pratyhra dhra dhyna and samdhi but these only preface perfection by devotional service which alone can award peace to the human being it is the highest perfection of life thus end

as he is obligated is in the renounced order of life and he is the true mystic not he who lights no fire and performs no duty purport in this chapter the lord explains that the process of the eightfold yoga system is a means to control the mind and the senses however this is very difficult for people in general to perform especially in the age of kali although the eightfold yoga system is recommended in this chapter the lord emphasizes that the process of karmayoga or acting in ka consciousness is better everyone acts in this world to maintain his family and their paraphernalia but no one is working without some selfinterest some personal gratification be it concentrated or extended the criterion of perfection is to act in ka consciousness and not with a view to enjoying the fruits of work copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved to act in ka consciousness is the duty of every living entity because all are constitutionally parts and parcels of the supreme the parts of the body work for the satisfaction of the whole body the limbs of the body do not act for selfsatisfaction but for the satisfaction of the complete whole similarly the living entity who acts for satisfaction of the supreme whole and not for personal satisfaction is the perfect sannys the perfect yogi the sannyss sometimes artificially think that they have become liberated from all material duties and therefore they cease to perform agnihotra yajas fire sacrifices but actually they are selfinterested because their goal is to become one with the impersonal brahman such a desire is greater than any material desire but it is not without selfinterest similarly the mystic yog who practices the yoga system with halfopen eyes ceasing all material activities desires some satisfaction for his personal self but a person acting in ka consciousness works for the satisfaction of the whole without selfinterest a ka conscious person has no desire for selfsatisfaction his criterion of success is the satisfaction of ka and thus he is the perfect sannys or perfect yog lord caitanya the highest perfectional symbol of renunciation prays in this way na dhana na jana na

renounces the desire for sense gratification purport real sannysayoga or bhakti means that one should know his constitutional position as the living entity and act accordingly the living entity has no separate independent identity he is the marginal energy of the supreme when he is entrapped by material energy he is conditioned and when he is ka conscious or aware of the spiritual energy then he is in his real and natural state of life therefore when one is in complete knowledge one ceases all material sense gratification or renounces all kinds of sense gratificatory activities this is practiced by the yogs who restrain the senses from material attachment but a person in ka consciousness has no opportunity to engage his senses in anything which is not for the purpose of ka therefore a ka conscious person is simultaneously a sannys and a yog the purpose of knowledge and of restraining the senses as prescribed in the jna and yoga processes is automatically served in ka consciousness if one is unable to give up the activities of his selfish nature then jna and yoga are of no avail copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved the real aim is for a living entity to give up all selfish satisfaction and to be prepared to satisfy the supreme a ka conscious person has no desire for any kind of selfenjoyment he is always engaged for the enjoyment of the supreme one who has no information of the supreme must therefore be engaged in selfsatisfaction because no one can stand on the platform of inactivity all purposes are perfectly served by the practice of ka

cessation of all material activities is said to be the means purport copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved the process of linking oneself with the supreme is called yoga it may be compared to a ladder for attaining the topmost spiritual realization this ladder begins from the lowest material condition of the living entity and rises up to perfect selfrealization in pure spiritual life according to various elevations different parts of the ladder are known by different names but all in all the complete ladder is called yoga and may be divided into three parts namely jnayoga dhynayoga and bhaktiyoga the beginning of the ladder is called the yogruruku stage and the highest rung is called yogrha concerning the eightfold yoga system attempts in the beginning to enter into meditation through regulative principles of life and practice of different sitting postures which are more or less bodily exercises are considered fruitive material activities all such activities lead to achieving perfect mental equilibrium to control the senses when one is accomplished in the practice of meditation he ceases all disturbing mental activities a ka conscious person however is situated from the beginning on the platform of meditation because he always thinks of ka and being constantly engaged in the service of ka he is considered to have ceased all material

as well purport the word tm denotes body mind and souldepending upon different circumstances in the yoga system the mind and the conditioned soul are especially important since the mind is the central point of yoga practice tm refers here to the mind the purpose of the yoga system is to control the mind and to draw it away from attachment to sense objects it is stressed herein that the mind must be so trained that it can deliver the conditioned soul from the mire of nescience in material existence one is subjected to the influence of the mind and the senses in fact the pure soul is entangled in the material world because the mind is involved with the false ego which desires to lord it over material nature therefore the mind should be trained so that it will not be attracted by the glitter of material nature and in this way the conditioned soul may be saved one should not degrade oneself by attraction to sense objects the more one is attracted by sense objects the more one becomes entangled in material existence the best way to disentangle oneself is to always engage the mind in ka consciousness the word hi is used for emphasizing this point ie that one must do this it is also

destination one has to abide by superior dictation when ones mind is fixed on the superior nature he has no alternative but to follow the dictation of the supreme the mind must admit some superior dictation and follow it the effect of controlling the mind is that one automatically follows the dictation of the paramtm or supersoul because this transcendental position is at once achieved by one

conscious simply by mundane scholarship one must be fortunate enough to associate with a person who is in pure consciousness a ka conscious person has realized knowledge by the grace of ka because he is satisfied with pure devotional service by realized knowledge one becomes perfect by transcendental knowledge one can remain steady in his convictions but by mere academic knowledge one can be easily deluded and confused by apparent contradictions it is the realized soul who is actually selfcontrolled because he is surrendered to ka he is transcendental because he has nothing to do with

as brahman paramtm and the supreme personality of godhead ka consciousness means concisely to be always engaged in the transcendental loving service of the lord but those who are attached to the impersonal brahman or the localized supersoul are also partially ka conscious because impersonal brahman is the spiritual ray of ka and supersoul is the allpervading partial expansion of ka thus the impersonalist and the meditator are also indirectly ka conscious a directly ka conscious person is the topmost transcendentalist because such a devotee knows what is meant by brahman and paramtm his knowledge of the absolute truth is perfect whereas the impersonalist and the meditative yog are imperfectly ka conscious nevertheless all of these are instructed herewith to be constantly engaged in their particular pursuits so that they may come to the highest perfection sooner or later the first business of a transcendentalist is to keep the mind copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved always on ka one should always think of ka and not forget him even for a moment concentration of the mind on the supreme is called samdhi or trance in order to concentrate the mind one should always remain in seclusion and avoid disturbance by external objects he should be very careful to accept favorable and reject unfavorable conditions that affect his realization and in perfect determination he should not hanker after unnecessary material things that entangle him by feelings of possessiveness all these perfections and precautions are perfectly executed when one is directly in ka consciousness because direct ka consciousness means selfabnegation wherein there is very little chance for material possessiveness rla rpa gosvm characterizes ka consciousness in this

is not as complete in his renunciation bhaktirasmtasindhu 2255256 a ka conscious person well knows that everything belongs to ka and thus he is always free from feelings of personal possession as such he has no hankering for anything on his own personal account he knows how to accept things in favor of ka consciousness and how to reject things unfavorable to ka consciousness he is always aloof from material things because he is always transcendental and he is always alone having nothing to do with persons not in ka consciousness therefore a person in ka consciousness is the perfect yog copyright

and the ganges flow but often this is not possible especially for westerners the socalled yoga societies in big cities may be successful in earning material benefit but they are not at all suitable for the actual practice of yoga one who is not selfcontrolled and whose mind is not undisturbed cannot practice meditation therefore in the bhannradya pura it is said that in kaliyuga the present yuga

yoga practice to realize this viumrti within the heart one has to observe complete abstinence from sex life therefore one has to leave home and live alone in a secluded place remaining seated as mentioned above one cannot enjoy sex life daily at home or elsewhere and attend a socalled yoga class and thus become a yog one has to practice controlling the mind and avoiding all kinds of sense gratification of which sex life is the chief in the rules of celibacy written by the great sage yjavalkya it is said karma manas vc sarvvasthsu sarvad sarvatra maithunatygo brahmacarya pracakate the vow of brahmacarya is meant to help one completely abstain from sex indulgence in work words and mindat all times under all circumstances and in all places no one can perform correct yoga practice through sex indulgence brahmacarya is taught therefore from childhood when one has no knowledge of sex life children at the age of five are sent to the gurukula or the place of the spiritual master and the master trains the young boys in the strict discipline of becoming brahmacrs without such practice no one can make advancement in any yoga whether it be dhyna jna or bhakti one who however follows the rules and regulations of married life having a sexual relationship only with his wife and that also under regulation is also called a brahmacr such a restrained householder brahmacr may be accepted in the bhakti school but the jna and dhyna schools do not even admit householder brahmacrs they require complete abstinence without compromise in the bhakti school a householder brahmacr is allowed controlled sex life because the cult of bhaktiyoga is so powerful that one automatically loses sexual attraction being engaged in the superior service of the lord in the bhagavadgt 259 it is said copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved viay vinivartante nirhrasya dehina rasavarja raso py asya para dv nivartate whereas others are forced to restrain themselves

no yog according to bhagavadgt nor does cessation of material existence entail ones entering into the void which is only a myth there is no void anywhere within the creation of the lord rather the cessation of material existence enables one to enter into the spiritual sky the abode of the lord the abode of the lord is also clearly described in the bhagavadgt as that place where there is no need of sun moon or electricity all the planets in the spiritual kingdom are selfilluminated like the sun in the material sky the kingdom of god is everywhere but the spiritual sky and the planets thereof are called para dhma or superior abodes a consummate yog who is perfect in understanding lord ka as is clearly stated herein by the lord himself matcitta matpara matsthnam can attain real peace and

nor can one who artificially abstains from eating manufacturing his own personal process of fasting practice yoga the ka conscious person observes fasting as it is recommended in the scriptures he does not fast or eat more than is required and he is thus competent to perform yoga practice one who eats more than required will dream very much while sleeping and he must consequently sleep more

sleeping is considered a great loss avyarthaklatvam ccmadhya 231819 a ka conscious person cannot bear to pass a minute of his life without being engaged in the service of the lord therefore his

gaining this he thinks there is no greater gain being situated in such a position one is never shaken even in the midst of greatest difficulty this indeed is actual freedom from all miseries arising from material contact purport copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved by practice of yoga one becomes gradually detached from material concepts this is the primary characteristic of the yoga principle and after this one becomes situated in trance or samdhi which means that the yog realizes the supersoul through transcendental mind and intelligence without any of the misgivings of identifying the self with the superself yoga practice is more or less based on the principles of the patajali system some unauthorized commentators try to identify the individual soul with the supersoul and the monists think this to be liberation but they do not understand the real purpose of the patajali system of yoga there is an acceptance of transcendental pleasure in the patajali system but the monists do not accept this transcendental pleasure out of fear of jeopardizing the theory of oneness the duality of knowledge and knower is not accepted by the nondualist but in this verse transcendental pleasurerealized through transcendental sensesis accepted and this is corroborated by patajali muni the famous exponent of the yoga system the great sage declares in his yogastras 334 pururthanyn gun pratiprasava kaivalya svarpapratih v citiaktir iti this citiakti or internal potency is transcendental pururtha means material religiosity economic development sense gratification and at the end the attempt to become one with the supreme this oneness with the supreme is called kaivalyam by the monist but according to patajali this kaivalyam is an internal or transcendental potency by which the living entity becomes aware of his constitutional position in the words of lord caitanya this state of affairs is called cetodarpaamrjanam cc antya 2012 or clearance of the impure mirror of the mind this clearance is actually liberation or bhavamahdvgninirvpaam the theory of nirvaalso preliminarycorresponds with this principle in the bhgavatam 2106 this is called svarpea vyavasthiti the bhagavadgt also confirms this situation in this verse after nirva or material cessation there is the manifestation of spiritual activities or devotional service to the lord known as ka consciousness in the words of the bhgavatam svarpea vyavasthiti this is the real life of the living entity my or illusion is the condition of spiritual life contaminated copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved by material infection liberation from this material infection does not mean destruction of the original eternal position of the living entity patajali also accepts this by his words kaivalya svarpapratih v citiaktir iti this citiakti or transcendental pleasure is real life this is confirmed in the vedntastra 1112 as nandamayo bhyst this natural transcendental pleasure is the ultimate goal of yoga and is easily achieved by execution of devotional service or bhaktiyoga bhaktiyoga will be vividly described in the seventh chapter of bhagavadgt in the yoga system as described in this chapter there are two kinds of samdhi called samprajtasamdhi and asamprajtasamdhi when one becomes situated in the transcendental position by various philosophical researches he is said to have achieved samprajtasamdhi in the asamprajtasamdhi there is no longer any connection with mundane pleasure for one is then transcendental to all sorts of happiness derived from the senses when the yog is once situated in that transcendental position he is never shaken from it unless the yog is able to reach this position he is unsuccessful todays socalled yoga practice which involves various sense pleasures is contradictory a yog indulging in sex and intoxication is a mockery even those yogs who are attracted by the siddhis perfections in the process of yoga are not perfectly situated if yogs are attracted by the byproducts of yoga then they cannot attain the stage of perfection as is stated in this verse persons therefore indulging in the makeshow practice of gymnastic feats or siddhis should know that the aim of yoga is lost in that way the best practice of yoga in this age is ka consciousness which is not baffling a ka conscious person is so happy in his occupation that he does not aspire after any other happiness there are many impediments especially in this age of hypocrisy to practicing hahayoga dhynayoga and jnayoga but there is no such problem in executing karmayoga or bhaktiyoga as long as the material body exists one has to meet the demands of the body namely eating sleeping defending and mating but a person who is in pure bhaktiyoga or in ka consciousness does not arouse the senses while meeting the demands of the body rather he accepts the bare necessities of life making the best use of a bad bargain and enjoys transcendental happiness copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved in ka consciousness he is callous toward incidental occurrencessuch as accidents disease scarcity and even the death of a most dear relativebut he is always alert to execute his duties in ka consciousness or bhaktiyoga accidents never deviate him from his duty as stated in the bhagavadgt 214

the big ocean carried away the eggs on its waves the sparrow became very upset and asked the ocean to return her eggs the ocean did not even consider her appeal so the sparrow decided to dry up the ocean she began to pick out the water in her small beak and everyone laughed at her for her impossible determination the news of her activity spread and at last garua the gigantic bird carrier of lord viu heard it he became compassionate toward his small sister bird and so he came to see the sparrow garua was very pleased by the determination of the small sparrow and he promised to help thus garua at once asked the ocean to return her eggs lest he himself take up the work of the sparrow the ocean was frightened at this and returned the eggs thus the sparrow became happy by the grace of garua

characterized by a bitter struggle for a life of short duration people are not serious about selfrealization even by simple practical means and what to speak of this difficult yoga system which regulates the mode of living the manner of sitting selection of place and detachment of the mind from material engagements as a practical man arjuna thought it was impossible to follow this system of yoga even though he was favorably endowed in many ways he belonged to the royal family and was highly elevated in terms of numerous qualities he was a great warrior he had great longevity and above all he was the most intimate friend of lord ka the supreme personality of godhead five thousand years ago arjuna had much better facilities than we do now yet he refused to accept this system of yoga

mind on the supersoul restraining the senses and mind observing celibacy remaining alone etc by the practice of ka consciousness however one engages in nine types of devotional service to the lord the first and foremost of such devotional engagements is hearing about ka this is a very powerful transcendental method for purging the mind of all misgivings the more one hears about ka the more one

detachment from matter and copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved engagement of the mind in spirit impersonal spiritual detachment is more difficult than attaching the mind to the activities of ka this is practical because by hearing about ka one becomes automatically attached to the supreme spirit this attachment is called parenubhava spiritual satisfaction it is just like the feeling of satisfaction a hungry man has for every morsel of food he eats the more one eats while hungry the more one feels satisfaction and strength similarly by discharge of devotional service one feels transcendental satisfaction as the mind becomes detached from material objectives it is something like curing a disease by expert treatment and appropriate diet hearing of the transcendental activities of lord ka is therefore expert treatment for the mad mind and eating the foodstuff offered to ka is the appropriate diet for the suffering patient this treatment is the process of ka consciousness text 36 asayataatmanaa yaaegaae duzpaapa wita mae maita vxyaatmanaa tau yatataa xakyaaevaumaupaayata 36 asayattman yogo duprpa iti me mati vaytman tu yatat akyo vptum

purport the path of selfrealization or mysticism is described in the bhagavadgt the basic principle of selfrealization is knowledge that the living entity is not this material body but that he is different from it and that his happiness is in eternal life bliss and knowledge these are transcendental beyond both body and mind selfrealization is sought by the path of knowledge by the practice of the eightfold system or by bhaktiyoga in each of these processes one has to realize the constitutional position of the living entity his relationship with god and the activities whereby he can reestablish the lost link and achieve the highest perfectional stage of ka consciousness following any of the abovementioned three methods one is sure to reach the supreme goal sooner or later this was asserted by the lord in the second chapter even a little endeavor on the transcendental path offers a great hope for deliverance out of these three methods the path of bhaktiyoga is especially suitable for this age because it is the most direct method of god realization to be doubly assured arjuna is asking lord ka to confirm his former statement one may sincerely accept the path of selfrealization but the process of cultivation of knowledge and the practice of the eightfold yoga system are generally very difficult for this age therefore despite constant endeavor one may fail for many reasons first of all one may not be sufficiently serious about following copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved the process to pursue the transcendental path is more or less to declare war on the illusory energy consequently whenever a person tries to escape the clutches of the illusory energy she tries to defeat the practitioner by various allurements a

sometimes deviates from a small cloud and joins a big one but if it cannot join a big one then it is blown away by the wind and becomes a nonentity in the vast sky the brahmaa pathi is the path of

subjected to these reactions the bhgavatam assures the unsuccessful transcendentalist that there need be no worries even though he may be subjected to the reaction for not perfectly executing prescribed duties he is still not a loser because auspicious ka consciousness is never forgotten and one so engaged will continue to be so even if he is lowborn in the next life on the other hand one who simply follows strictly the prescribed duties need not necessarily attain auspicious results if he is lacking in ka consciousness the purport may be understood as follows humanity may be divided into two sections namely the regulated and the nonregulated those who are engaged simply in bestial sense gratifications without knowledge of their next life or spiritual salvation belong to the nonregulated section and those who follow the principles of prescribed duties in the scriptures are classified amongst the regulated section the nonregulated section both civilized and noncivilized educated and noneducated strong and weak are full of animal propensities their activities are never auspicious because while enjoying the animal propensities of eating sleeping defending and mating they perpetually remain in material existence which is always miserable on the other hand those who are regulated by scriptural injunctions and who thus rise gradually to ka consciousness certainly progress in life those who are following the path of auspiciousness can be divided into three sections namely 1 the followers of scriptural rules and regulations who are enjoying material prosperity 2 those who are trying to find ultimate liberation from material existence and 3 those who are devotees in ka consciousness those who are following the rules and regulations of the scriptures for material happiness may be further divided into two classes those who are fruitive workers and those who desire no fruit for sense gratification those who are after fruitive results for sense

liberation from the material bodily concept of life is not at all auspicious activity in ka consciousness is the only auspicious activity and anyone who voluntarily accepts all bodily discomforts for the sake of making progress on the path of ka consciousness can be called a perfect transcendentalist under severe austerity and because the eightfold yoga system is directed toward the ultimate

method adopted when the linking process is predominantly in fruitive activities it is called karmayoga when it is predominantly empirical it is called jnayoga and when it is predominantly in a devotional relationship with the supreme lord it is called bhaktiyoga bhaktiyoga or ka consciousness is the ultimate perfection of all yogas as will be explained in the next verse the lord has confirmed herein the superiority of yoga but he has not mentioned that it is better than bhaktiyoga bhaktiyoga is full spiritual knowledge and therefore nothing can excel it asceticism without selfknowledge is imperfect empiric knowledge without surrender to the supreme lord is also imperfect and fruitive work without ka consciousness is a waste of time therefore the most highly praised

is the most intimately united with me in yoga and is the highest of all that is my opinion purport the word bhajate is significant here bhajate has its root in the verb bhaj which is used when there is need of service the english word worship cannot be used in the same sense as bhaj worship means to adore or to show respect and honor to the worthy one but service with love and faith is especially meant for the supreme personality of godhead one can avoid worshiping a respectable man or a demigod and may be called discourteous but one cannot avoid serving the supreme lord without being thoroughly condemned every living entity is part and parcel of the supreme personality of godhead and thus every living entity is intended to serve the supreme lord by his own constitution failing to do this he falls down the bhgavatam 1153 confirms this as follows ya e purua skd tmaprabhavam varam copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved na bhajanty avajnanti sthnd bhra patanty adha anyone who does not render service and neglects his duty unto the primeval lord who is the source of all living entities will certainly fall down from his constitutional position in this verse also the word bhajanti is used therefore bhajanti is applicable to the supreme lord only whereas the word worship can be applied to demigods or to any other common living entity the word avajnanti used in this verse of rmadbhgavatam is also found in the bhagavadgt avajnanti m mh only the fools and rascals deride the supreme personality of godhead lord ka such fools take it upon themselves to write commentaries on the bhagavadgt without an attitude of service to the lord consequently they cannot properly distinguish between the word bhajanti and the word worship the culmination of all kinds of yoga practices lies in bhakti yoga all other yogas are but means to come to the point of bhakti in bhaktiyoga yoga actually means bhaktiyoga all other yogas are progressions toward the destination of bhaktiyoga from the beginning of karmayoga to the end of bhaktiyoga is a long way to selfrealization karmayoga without fruitive results is the beginning of this path when karmayoga increases in knowledge and renunciation the stage is called jnayoga when jnayoga increases in meditation on the supersoul by different physical processes and the mind is on him it is called agayoga and when one surpasses the agayoga and comes to the point of the supreme personality of godhead ka it is called bhakti yoga the culmination factually bhaktiyoga is the ultimate goal but to analyze bhaktiyoga minutely one has to understand these other yogas the yog who is progressive is therefore on the true path of eternal good fortune one who sticks to a particular point and does not make further progress is called by that particular name karmayog jnayog or dhynayog rjayog hahayog etc if one is fortunate enough to come to the point of bhaktiyoga it is to be understood that he has surpassed all other yogas therefore to become ka conscious is the highest stage of yoga just as when we speak of himlayan we refer to the worlds highest mountains of copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved which the highest peak mount everest is considered to be the culmination it is by great fortune that one comes to ka consciousness on the path of bhaktiyoga to become well situated according to the vedic direction the ideal yog concentrates his attention on ka who is called ymasundara who is as beautifully colored as a cloud whose lotuslike face is as effulgent as the sun whose dress is brilliant with jewels and whose body is flowergarlanded illuminating all sides is his gorgeous luster which is called the brahmajyoti he incarnates in different forms such as rma nsiha varha and ka the supreme personality of godhead and he descends like a human being as the son of mother yaod and he is known as ka govinda and vsudeva he is the perfect child husband friend and master and he is full with all opulences and transcendental qualities if one remains fully conscious of these features of the lord he is called the highest yogi this

nonmaterial spirit soul capable of elevating himself to selfrealization by different types of yogas at the end of the sixth chapter it has been clearly stated that the steady concentration of the mind upon ka or in other words ka consciousness is the highest form of all yoga by concentrating ones mind upon ka one is able to know the absolute truth completely but not otherwise impersonal brahmajyoti or localized paramtm realization is not perfect knowledge of the absolute truth because it is partial full and scientific knowledge is ka and everything is revealed to the person in ka consciousness in complete ka consciousness one knows that ka is ultimate knowledge beyond any doubts different types of yoga are only steppingstones on the path of ka consciousness one who takes directly to ka consciousness automatically knows about brahmajyoti and paramtm in full by practice of ka consciousness yoga one can know everything in fullnamely the absolute truth the living entities the material nature and their manifestations with paraphernalia one should therefore begin yoga practice as directed in the last verse of the sixth chapter concentration of the mind upon ka the supreme is made possible by prescribed devotional service in nine different forms of which ravaam is the first and most important the lord therefore says to arjuna tac chu or hear from me no one can be a greater

process of realization by jnayoga dhynayoga and discrimination of the self from matter however ka can be known only by persons who are in ka consciousness other transcendentalists may achieve impersonal brahman realization for this is easier than understanding ka ka is the supreme person but at the same time he is beyond the knowledge of brahman and paramtm the yogs and jns are confused in their attempts to understand ka although the greatest of the impersonalists rpda akarcrya has admitted in his gt commentary that ka is the supreme personality of godhead his followers do not accept ka as such for it is very difficult to know ka even though one has transcendental realization of impersonal brahman ka is the supreme personality of godhead the cause of all causes the primeval lord

easy the socalled path of bhakti practiced by unauthorized persons without knowledge of bhakti copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved may be easy but when it is practiced

even the great demigods are sometimes confused about ka muhyanti yat sraya m tu veda na kacana no one knows me as i am the lord says and if one does know him then sa mahtm sudurlabha such a great soul

atoms anyone who knows these three vius can be liberated from material entanglement this material world is a temporary manifestation of one of the energies of the lord all the activities of the material world are directed by these three viu expansions of lord ka these puruas are called incarnations generally one who does not know the science of god ka assumes that this material world is for the enjoyment of the living entities and that the living entities are the puruasthe causes controllers and enjoyers of the material energy according to bhagavadgt this atheistic conclusion is false in the verse under discussion it is stated that ka is the original cause of the material manifestation rmadbhgavatam also confirms this the ingredients of the material manifestation are separated energies of the lord even the brahmajyoti which is the ultimate goal of the impersonalists is a spiritual energy manifested in the spiritual sky there are no spiritual diversities in the brahmajyoti as there are in the vaikuhalokas and the impersonalist accepts this brahmajyoti as the ultimate eternal goal the paramtm manifestation is also a temporary allpervasive aspect of the krodakay viu the paramtm manifestation is not eternal in the spiritual world therefore the factual absolute truth is the supreme personality of godhead ka he is the complete energetic person and he possesses different separated and internal energies in the material energy the principal manifestations are eight as above mentioned out of these the first five manifestations namely earth water fire air and sky are called the five gigantic creations or the gross creations within which the five sense objects are included they are the manifestations of physical sound touch form taste and smell material science comprises these ten items and nothing more but the other three items namely mind copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved intelligence and false ego are neglected by the materialists philosophers who deal with mental activities are also not perfect in knowledge because they do not know the ultimate source ka the false egoi am and it is mine which constitute the basic principle of material existenceincludes ten sense organs for material activities intelligence refers to the total material creation called the mahattattva therefore from the eight separated energies of the lord are manifest the twentyfour elements of the material world which are the subject matter of skhya atheistic philosophy they are originally offshoots from kas energies and are separated from him but atheistic skhya philosophers with a poor fund of knowledge do not know ka as the cause of all causes the subject matter for discussion in the skhya philosophy is only the manifestation of the

mightyarmed arjuna there is another superior energy of mine which comprises the living entities who are exploiting the resources of this material inferior nature purport here it is clearly mentioned that living entities belong to the superior nature or energy of the supreme lord the inferior energy is matter manifested in different elements namely earth water fire air ether mind intelligence and false ego both forms of material nature namely gross earth etc and subtle mind etc are products of the inferior energy the living entities who are exploiting these inferior energies for different purposes are the superior energy of the supreme lord and it is due to this energy that the entire material world functions the cosmic manifestation has no power to act unless it is moved by the superior energy the living entity energies are always controlled by the energetic and therefore the living entities are always controlled by the lordthey have no independent existence they are never equally powerful as unintelligent men think the distinction between the living entities and the lord is described in rmadbhgavatam 108730 as follows aparimit dhruvs tanubhto yadi sarvagats tarhi na syateti niyamo dhruva netarath ajani ca yanmaya tad avimucya niyant bhavet samam anujnat yad amata mataduatay o supreme eternal if the embodied living entities were eternal and allpervading like you then they would not be under your control but if the living entities are accepted as minute energies of your lordship then they are at once subject to your supreme control therefore real liberation entails surrender by the living entities to your control and that surrender will make them happy in that constitutional position only can they be controllers therefore men with limited knowledge who advocate the monistic theory that god and the living entities are equal in all respects are actually guided by a copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved faulty and polluted opinion the supreme lord ka is the only controller and all living entities are controlled by him these living entities are his superior energy because the quality of their existence is one and the same with the supreme but they are never equal to the lord in quantity of power while exploiting the gross and subtle inferior energy matter the superior energy the living entity forgets his real spiritual mind and intelligence this forgetfulness is due to the influence of matter upon the living entity but when the living entity becomes free from the influence of the illusory material energy he attains the stage called mukti or liberation the false ego under the influence of material illusion thinks i am matter and material acquisitions are mine his actual position is realized when he is liberated from all material ideas including the conception of his becoming one in all respects with god therefore one may conclude that the gt confirms the living entity to be only one of the multienergies of ka and when this energy is freed from material contamination it becomes fully ka conscious or liberated text 6 wtaaenaqina autaaina savaraqtyaupadaarya ah ktsya jagata paav

purport everything that exists is a product of matter and spirit spirit is the basic field of creation and matter is created by spirit spirit is not created at a certain stage of material development rather this material world is manifested only on the basis of spiritual energy this material body is developed because spirit is present within matter a child grows gradually to boyhood and then to manhood because that superior energy spirit soul is present similarly the entire cosmic manifestation of the gigantic universe is developed because of the presence of the supersoul viu therefore spirit and matter which combine to manifest this gigantic universal form are originally two energies of the lord and consequently the lord is the original cause of everything a fragmental part and parcel of the lord namely the living entity may be the cause of a big skyscraper a big factory or even a big city but he cannot be the cause of a big universe the cause of the big universe is the big soul or the supersoul and ka the supreme is the cause of both the big and small souls therefore he is the original cause of all causes this is confirmed in the kaha upaniad 2213 nityo nityn cetana

vetvatara upaniad 310 tato yad uttaratara tad arpam anmayam ya etad vidur amts te bhavanti athetare dukham evpiyanti in the material world brahm the primeval living entity within the universe is understood to be the supreme amongst the demigods human beings and lower animals but beyond brahm there is the transcendence who has no material form and is free from all material contaminations anyone who can know him also becomes transcendental but those who do copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved not know him suffer the miseries of the material world the impersonalist puts more stress on the word arpam but this arpam is not impersonal it indicates the transcendental form of eternity bliss and knowledge as described in the brahmasahit quoted above other verses in the vetvatara upaniad 389 substantiate this as follows vedham eta purua mahntam dityavara tamasa parastt tam eva viditvti mtyum eti nnya panth vidyate yanya yasmt para nparam asti

only he who knows him can transcend the bonds of birth and death there is no way for liberation other than this knowledge of that supreme person there is no truth superior to that supreme person because he is the supermost he is smaller than the smallest and he is greater than the greatest he is situated as a silent tree and he illumines the transcendental sky and as a tree spreads its roots he spreads his extensive energies from these verses one concludes that the supreme absolute truth is the supreme personality of godhead who is allpervading by his multienergies both material and

perceived by his different energies and in this way he is realized impersonally as the demigod in the sun is a person and is perceived by his allpervading energy the sunshine so the lord although in his eternal abode is perceived by his allpervading diffusive energies the taste of water is the active principle of water no one likes to drink sea water because the pure taste of water is mixed with salt attraction for water depends on the purity of the taste and this pure taste is one of the energies of the lord the impersonalist perceives the presence of the lord in water by its taste and the personalist also glorifies the lord for his kindly supplying tasty water to quench mans thirst that is the way of perceiving the supreme practically speaking there is no conflict between personalism and impersonalism one who knows god knows that the impersonal conception and personal conception are simultaneously present in copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved

by these three modes cannot understand that transcendental to this material nature is the supreme lord ka every living entity under the influence of material nature has a particular type of body and a particular type of psychological and biological activities accordingly there are four classes of men functioning in the three material modes of nature those who are purely in the mode of goodness are called brhmaas those who are purely in the mode of passion are called katriyas those who are in the modes of both passion and ignorance are called vaiyas those who are completely in ignorance are called dras and those who are less than that are animals or animal life however these designations are not permanent i may either be a brhmaa katriya vaiya or whateverin any case this life is temporary but although life is temporary and we do not know copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved what we are going to be in the next life by the spell of this illusory energy we consider ourselves in terms of this bodily conception of life and we thus think that we are american indian russian or brhmaa hindu muslim etc and if we become entangled with the modes of material nature then we forget the supreme personality of godhead who is behind all these modes so lord ka says that living entities deluded by these three modes of nature do not understand that behind the material background is the supreme personality of godhead there are many different kinds of living entitieshuman beings demigods animals etcand each and every one of them is under the influence of material nature and all of them have forgotten the transcendent personality of godhead those who are in the modes of passion and ignorance and even those who are in the mode of goodness cannot go beyond the impersonal brahman conception of the absolute truth they are bewildered before the supreme lord in his personal feature which possesses all beauty opulence knowledge strength fame

this divine energy of mine consisting of the three modes of material nature is difficult to overcome but those who have surrendered unto me can easily cross beyond it purport the supreme personality of godhead has innumerable energies and all these energies are divine although the living entities are part of his energies and are therefore divine due to contact with material energy their original superior power is covered being thus covered by material energy one cannot possibly overcome its influence as previously stated both the material and spiritual natures being emanations from the supreme personality of godhead are eternal the living entities belong to the eternal superior nature of the lord but due to contamination by the inferior nature matter their illusion is also eternal the conditioned soul is therefore called nityabaddha or eternally conditioned no one can trace out the history of his becoming conditioned at a certain date in material history consequently his release from the clutches of material nature is very difficult even though that material nature is an inferior energy because material energy is ultimately conducted by the supreme will which the living entity cannot overcome inferior material nature is defined herein as divine nature due to its divine connection and movement by the divine will being conducted by divine will material nature although inferior acts so wonderfully in the construction and destruction of the cosmic manifestation the vedas confirm this as follows my tu prakti vidyn myina tu mahevaram although my illusion is false or temporary the background of my is the supreme magician the personality of copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved godhead who is mahevara the supreme controller vetvatara upaniad 410 another meaning of gua is rope it is to be understood that the conditioned soul is tightly tied by the ropes of illusion a man bound by the hands and feet cannot free himselfhe must be helped by a person who is unbound because the bound cannot help the bound the rescuer must be liberated therefore only lord ka or his bona fide representative the spiritual master can release the conditioned soul without such superior help one cannot be freed from the bondage of material nature devotional service or ka consciousness can help one gain such release ka being the lord of illusory energy can order this insurmountable energy to release the conditioned soul he orders this release out of his causeless mercy on the surrendered soul and out of his paternal affection for the living entity who is originally a beloved son of the lord therefore surrender unto the lotus feet of the lord is the only means to get free from the clutches of the stringent material nature the words mm eva are also significant mm means unto ka viu only and not brahm or iva although brahm and iva are greatly elevated and are almost on the level of viu it is not possible for such incarnations of rajogua passion and tamogua ignorance to release the conditioned soul from the clutches of my in other words both brahm and iva are also under the influence of my only viu is the master of my therefore he alone can give release to the conditioned soul the vedas vetvatara upaniad 38 confirm this in the phrase tam eva viditv or freedom is possible only by understanding ka even lord iva affirms that liberation can be achieved only by the mercy of viu lord iva says muktipradt sarve viur eva na saaya there is no doubt that viu is the deliverer of liberation for everyone text 15 na maa

question arises how is it that educated philosophers scientists businessmen administrators and all the leaders of ordinary men do not surrender to the lotus feet of r ka the allpowerful personality of godhead mukti or liberation from the laws of material nature is sought by the leaders of mankind in different ways and with great plans and perseverance for a great many years and births but if that liberation is possible by simply surrendering unto the lotus feet of the supreme personality of godhead then why dont these intelligent and hardworking leaders adopt this simple method the gt answers this question very frankly those really learned leaders of copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved society like brahm iva kapila the kumras manu vysa devala asita janaka prahlda bali and later on madhvcrya rmnujcrya r caitanya and many otherswho are faithful philosophers politicians educators scientists etcsurrender to the lotus feet of the supreme person the allpowerful authority those who are not actually philosophers scientists educators administrators etc but who pose themselves as such for material gain do not accept the plan or path of the supreme lord they have no idea of god they simply manufacture their own worldly plans and consequently complicate the problems of material existence in their vain attempts to solve them because material energy nature is so powerful it can resist the unauthorized plans of the atheists and baffle the knowledge of planning commissions the atheistic planmakers are described herein by the word duktina or miscreants kt means one who has performed meritorious work the atheist planmaker is sometimes very intelligent and meritorious also because any gigantic plan good or bad must take intelligence to execute but because the atheists brain is improperly utilized in opposing the plan of the supreme lord the atheistic planmaker is called dukt which indicates that his intelligence and efforts are misdirected in the gt it is clearly mentioned that material energy works fully under the direction of the supreme lord it has no independent authority it works as the shadow moves in accordance with the movements of the object but still material energy is very powerful and the atheist due to his godless temperament cannot know how it works nor can he know the plan of the supreme lord under illusion and the modes of passion and ignorance all his plans are baffled as in the case of hirayakaipu and rvaa whose plans were smashed to dust although they were both materially learned as scientists philosophers administrators and educators these duktinas or miscreants are of four different patterns as outlined below 1 the mhas are those who are grossly foolish like hardworking beasts of burden they want to enjoy the fruits of their labor by themselves and so do not want to part with them for the supreme the typical example of the beast of burden is the ass this humble beast is made to work very hard by his copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved master the ass does not really know for whom he works so hard day and night he remains satisfied by filling his stomach with a bundle of grass sleeping for a while under fear of being beaten by his master and satisfying his sex appetite at the risk of being repeatedly kicked by the opposite party the ass sings poetry and philosophy sometimes but this braying sound only disturbs others this is the position of the foolish fruitive worker who does not know for whom he should work he does not know that karma action is meant for yaja sacrifice most often those who work very hard day and night to clear the burden of selfcreated duties say that they have no time to hear of the immortality of the living being to such mhas material gains which are destructible are lifes all in alldespite the fact that the mhas enjoy only a very small fraction of the fruit of labor sometimes they spend sleepless days and nights for fruitive gain and although they may have ulcers or indigestion they are satisfied with practically no food they are simply absorbed in working hard day and night for the benefit of illusory masters ignorant of their real master the foolish workers waste their valuable time serving mammon unfortunately they never surrender to the supreme master of all masters nor do they take time to hear of him from the proper sources the swine who eat the night soil do not care to accept sweetmeats made of sugar and ghee similarly the foolish worker will untiringly continue to hear of the senseenjoyable tidings of the flickering mundane world but will have very little time to hear about the eternal living force that moves the material world 2 another class of dukt or miscreant is called the nardhama or the lowest of mankind nara means human being and adhama means the lowest out of the 8400000 different species of living beings there are 400000 human species out of these there are numerous lower forms of human life that are mostly uncivilized the civilized human beings are those who have regulative principles of social political and religious life those who are socially and politically developed but who have no religious principles must be considered nardhamas nor is religion without god religion because the purpose of following religious principles is to know the supreme truth and mans relation with him in the gt the personality of godhead clearly states copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved that there is no authority above him and that he is the supreme truth the civilized form of human life is meant for mans reviving the lost consciousness of his eternal relation with the supreme truth the personality of godhead r ka who is allpowerful whoever loses this chance is classified as a nardhama we get information from revealed scriptures that when the baby is in the mothers womb an extremely uncomfortable situation he prays to god for deliverance and promises to worship him alone as soon as he gets out to pray to god when he is in difficulty is a natural instinct in every living being because he is eternally related with god but after his deliverance the child forgets the difficulties of birth and forgets his deliverer also being influenced by my the illusory energy it is the duty of the guardians of children to revive the divine consciousness dormant in them the ten processes of reformatory ceremonies as enjoined in the manusmti which is the guide to religious principles are meant for reviving god consciousness in the system of varrama however no process is strictly followed now in any part of the world and therefore 999 percent of the population is nardhama when the whole population becomes nardhama naturally all their socalled education is made null and void by the allpowerful energy of physical nature according to the standard of the gt a learned man is he who sees on equal terms the learned brhmaa the dog the cow the elephant and the dogeater that is the vision of a true devotee r nitynanda prabhu who is the incarnation of godhead as divine master delivered the typical nardhamas the brothers jagi and mdhi and showed how the mercy of a real devotee is bestowed upon the lowest of mankind so the nardhama who is condemned by the personality of godhead can again revive his spiritual consciousness only by the mercy of a devotee r caitanya mahprabhu in propagating the bhgavatadharma or activities of the devotees has recommended that people submissively hear the message of the personality of godhead the essence of this message is bhagavadgt the lowest amongst human beings can be delivered by this submissive hearing process only but unfortunately they even refuse to give an aural reception to these messages and what to speak of surrendering to the will copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved of the supreme lord nardhamas or the lowest of mankind will fully neglect the prime duty of the human being 3 the next class of dukt is called myaypahtajn or those persons whose erudite knowledge has been nullified by the influence of illusory material energy they are mostly very learned fellowsgreat philosophers poets literati scientists etcbut the illusory energy misguides them and therefore they disobey the supreme lord there are a great number of myaypahtajn at the present moment even amongst the scholars of the bhagavadgt in the gt in plain and simple language it is stated that r ka is the supreme personality of godhead there is none equal to or greater than him he is mentioned as the father of brahm the original father of all human beings in fact r ka is said to be not only the father of brahm but also the father of all species of life he is the root of the impersonal brahman and paramtm the supersoul in every entity is his plenary portion he is the fountainhead of everything and everyone is advised to surrender unto his lotus feet despite all these clear statements the myaypahtajn deride the personality of the supreme lord and consider him merely another human being they do not know that the blessed form of human life is designed after the eternal and transcendental feature of the supreme lord all the unauthorized interpretations of the gt by the class of myaypahtajn outside the purview of the parampar system are so many stumbling blocks on the path of spiritual understanding the deluded interpreters do not surrender unto the lotus feet of r ka nor do they teach others to follow this principle 4 the last class of dukt is called sura bhvam rit or those of demonic principles this class is openly atheistic some of them argue that the supreme lord can never descend upon this material world but they are unable to give any tangible reasons as to why not there are others who make him subordinate to the impersonal feature although the opposite is declared in the gt envious of the supreme personality of godhead the atheist will present a number of illicit incarnations manufactured in the factory of his brain such persons whose very principle of life is to decry the personality of godhead copyright

the supreme lord out of these there are four classes of menthose who are sometimes distressed those who are in need of money those who are sometimes inquisitive and those who are sometimes searching after knowledge of the absolute truth these persons come to the supreme lord for devotional service under different conditions these are not pure devotees because they have some aspiration to fulfill in exchange for devotional service pure devotional service is without aspiration and without desire for material profit the bhaktirasmtasindhu 1111 defines pure devotion thus anybhilitnya jnakarmdyanvtam nuklyena knulana bhaktir uttam madhya 19167 one should render transcendental loving service to the supreme lord ka favorably and without desire for material profit or gain through fruitive activities or philosophical speculation that is called pure devotional service when these four kinds of persons come to the supreme lord for devotional service and are completely purified by the association of a pure devotee they also become pure devotees as far as the miscreants are concerned for them devotional service is very difficult because their lives are selfish irregular and without spiritual goals but even some of them by chance when they come in contact with a pure devotee also become pure devotees those who are always busy with fruitive activities come to the lord in copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved material distress and at that time associate with pure devotees and become in their distress devotees of the lord those who are simply frustrated also come sometimes to associate with the pure devotees and become inquisitive to know about god similarly when the dry philosophers are frustrated in every field of knowledge they sometimes want to learn of god and they come to the supreme lord to render devotional service and thus transcend knowledge of the impersonal brahman and the localized paramtm and come to the personal conception of godhead by the grace of the supreme lord or his pure devotee on the whole when the distressed the inquisitive the seekers of knowledge and those who are in need of money are free from all material desires and when they fully understand that material remuneration has nothing to do with spiritual improvement they become pure devotees as long as such a purified stage is not attained devotees in transcendental service to the lord are tainted with fruitive activities the search for mundane knowledge etc so one has to transcend all this before one can come to the stage of pure devotional service text 17 taeza janaq inatyayau wkaiivrixazyatae ipayaae ih jainanaaetyaqarmah sa c mama ipaya 17 te jn nityayukta ekabhaktir viiyate priyo hi jnino tyartham aha sa ca mama priya

is different from his material body and when further advanced he comes to the knowledge of impersonal brahman and paramtm when one is fully purified he realizes that his constitutional position is to be the eternal servant of god so by association with pure devotees the inquisitive the distressed the seeker after material amelioration and the man in knowledge all become themselves pure but in the

lord says that all are magnanimous because anyone who comes to the lord for any purpose is called a mahtm or great soul the devotees who want some benefit out of devotional service are accepted by the lord because there is an exchange of affection out of affection they ask the lord for some material benefit and when they get it they become so satisfied that they also advance in devotional service

causes and all that is such a great soul is very rare copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved purport the living entity while executing devotional service or transcendental rituals after many many births may actually become situated in transcendental pure knowledge that the supreme personality of godhead is the ultimate goal of spiritual realization in the beginning of spiritual realization while one is trying to give up ones attachment to materialism there is some leaning towards impersonalism but when one is further advanced he can understand that there are activities in the spiritual life and that these activities constitute devotional service realizing this he becomes attached to the supreme personality of godhead and surrenders to him at such a time one can understand that lord r kas mercy is everything that he is the cause of all causes and that this material manifestation is not independent from him he realizes the material world to be a perverted reflection of spiritual variegatedness and realizes that in everything there is a relationship with the supreme lord ka thus he thinks of everything in relation to vsudeva or r ka such a universal vision of vsudeva precipitates ones full surrender to the supreme lord r ka as the highest goal such surrendered great souls are very rare this verse is very nicely explained in the third

body of a living being neither the power to speak nor the power to see nor the power to hear nor the power to think is the prime factor it is life which is the center of all activities similarly lord vsudeva or the personality of godhead lord r ka is the prime entity in everything in this body there are powers of speaking of seeing of hearing of mental activities etc but these are not important if not related to the supreme lord and because vsudeva is allpervading and everything is vsudeva the devotee surrenders in full knowledge cf bhagavadgt 717 and 1140 text 20 kamaestaestaertajanaa

contamination is not completely washed off they are by nature nondevotees but even those who have material desires and who resort to the supreme lord are not so much attracted by external nature because of approaching the right goal they soon become free from all material lust in the rmadbhgavatam it is recommended that whether one is a pure devotee and is free from all material desires or is full of material desires or desires liberation from material contamination he should in all cases surrender to vsudeva and worship him as stated in the bhgavatam 2310 akma sarvakmo v mokakma udradh tvrea bhaktiyogena yajeta purua param less intelligent people who have lost their spiritual sense take shelter of demigods for immediate fulfillment of material desires generally such people do not go to the supreme personality of godhead because they are in the lower modes of nature ignorance and passion and therefore worship various demigods following the rules and regulations of worship they are satisfied the worshipers of demigods are motivated by small desires and do not know how to reach the supreme goal but a devotee of the supreme lord is not misguided because in vedic literature there are recommendations for worshiping different gods for different purposes eg a diseased man is recommended to worship the sun those who are not devotees of the lord think that for certain purposes demigods are better than the supreme lord but a pure devotee knows that the supreme lord ka is the master of all in the caitanyacaritmta di 5142 it is said ekale vara ka ra saba bhtya only the supreme personality of godhead ka is master and all others are servants therefore a pure devotee never goes to demigods for satisfaction of his material needs he depends on the supreme lord and the pure

wants very sincerely to have such facilities from the material demigods the supreme lord as supersoul in everyones heart understands and gives facilities to such persons as the supreme father of all living entities he does not interfere with their independence but gives all facilities so that they can fulfill their material desires some may ask why the allpowerful god gives facilities to the living entities for enjoying this material world and so lets them fall into the trap of the illusory energy the answer is that if the supreme lord as supersoul does not give such facilities then there copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved is no meaning to independence therefore he gives everyone full independencewhatever one likesbut his ultimate instruction we find in the bhagavadgt one should give up all other engagements and fully surrender unto him that will make man happy both the living entity and the demigods are subordinate to the will of the supreme personality of godhead therefore the living entity cannot worship the demigod by his own desire nor can the demigod bestow any benediction without the supreme will as it is said not a blade of grass moves without the will of the supreme personality of godhead generally persons who are distressed in the material world go to the demigods as they are advised in the vedic literature a person wanting some particular thing may worship such and such a demigod for example a diseased person is recommended to worship the sungod a person wanting education may worship the goddess of learning sarasvat and a person wanting a beautiful wife may worship the goddess um the wife of lord iva in this way there are recommendations in the stras vedic scriptures for different modes of worship of different demigods and because a particular living entity wants to enjoy a particular material facility the lord inspires him with a strong desire to achieve that benediction from that particular demigod and so he successfully receives the benediction the particular mode of the devotional attitude of the living entity toward a particular type of demigod is also arranged by the supreme lord the demigods cannot infuse the living entities with such an affinity but because he is the supreme lord or the supersoul who is present in the hearts of all living entities ka gives impetus to man to worship certain demigods the demigods are actually different parts of the universal body of the supreme lord therefore they have no independence in the vedic literature it is stated the supreme personality of godhead as supersoul is also present within the heart of the demigod therefore he arranges through the demigod to fulfill the desire of the living entity but both the demigod and the living entity are dependent on the supreme will they are not independent text 22 copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved sa tayaa yaa yaustasyaaradanamaqhtae latae c tata kamaanmayaev

but to the supreme personality of godhead by arrangement the less intelligent living entity does not know this and therefore he foolishly goes to the demigods for some benefit but the pure devotee when in need of something prays only to the supreme lord asking for material benefit however is not a sign of a pure devotee a living entity goes to the demigods usually because he is mad to fulfill his lust this happens when something undue is desired by the living entity and the lord himself does not fulfill the copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved desire in the caitanyacaritmta it is said that one who worships the supreme lord and at the same time desires material enjoyment is contradictory in his desires devotional service to the supreme lord and the worship of a demigod cannot be on the same platform because worship of a demigod is material and devotional service to the supreme lord is completely spiritual for the living entity who desires to return to godhead material desires are impediments a pure devotee of the lord is therefore not awarded the material benefits desired by less intelligent living entities who therefore prefer to worship

purport some commentators on the bhagavadgt say that one who worships a demigod can reach the supreme lord but here it is clearly stated that the worshipers of demigods go to the different planetary systems where various demigods are situated just as a worshiper of the sun achieves the sun or a worshiper of the demigod of the moon achieves the moon similarly if anyone wants to worship a demigod like indra he can attain that particular gods planet it is not that everyone regardless of whatever demigod is worshiped will reach the supreme personality of godhead that is denied here for it is clearly stated that the worshipers of demigods go to different planets in the material world but the devotee of the supreme lord goes directly to the supreme planet of the personality of godhead here the point may be raised that if the demigods are different parts of the body of the supreme lord then the same end should be achieved by worshiping them however worshipers of the demigods are less intelligent because they dont know to what part of the body food must be supplied some of them are so foolish that they claim that there are many parts and many ways to supply food this isnt very sanguine can anyone supply food to the body through the ears or eyes they do not know that these demigods are different parts of the universal body of the supreme lord and in their ignorance they believe that each and every demigod is a separate god and a competitor of the supreme lord not only are demigods parts of the supreme lord but ordinary living entities are also in the rmadbhgavatam it is stated that the brhmaas are the head of the supreme lord the katriyas are his arms the vaiyas are his waist the dras are his legs and all serve different functions regardless of the situation if one knows that both the demigods and himself are part and parcel of the supreme lord his knowledge is perfect but if he does not understand this he achieves different planets where the demigods reside this is not the same destination the devotee reaches the results achieved by the demigods benedictions are perishable because within this material world the planets the demigods and their worshipers are copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved all perishable therefore it is clearly stated in this verse that all results achieved by worshiping demigods are perishable and therefore such worship is performed by the less intelligent living entity because the pure devotee engaged in ka consciousness in devotional service of the supreme lord achieves eternal blissful

boddhum my dear lord devotees like vysadeva and nrada know you to be the personality of godhead by understanding different vedic literatures one can come to know your characteristics your form and your activities and one can thus understand that you are the supreme personality of godhead but those who are in the modes of passion and ignorance the demons the nondevotees cannot understand you they are unable to understand you however expert such nondevotees may be in discussing vednta and the upaniads and other vedic literatures it is not possible for them to understand the personality of godhead stotraratna 12 in the brahmasahit it is stated that the personality of godhead cannot be understood simply by study of the vednta literature only by the mercy of the supreme lord can the personality of the supreme be known therefore in this verse it is clearly stated that not only are the worshipers of the demigods less intelligent but those nondevotees who are engaged in vednta and speculation on vedic literature without any tinge of true ka consciousness are also less intelligent and for them it is not possible to understand gods personal nature persons who are under the impression that the absolute truth is impersonal are described as abuddhaya which means those who do not know the ultimate feature of the absolute truth in the rmadbhgavatam it is stated that supreme realization begins from the impersonal brahman and then rises to the localized supersoulbut the copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved ultimate word in the absolute truth is the personality of godhead modern impersonalists are still less intelligent for they do not even follow their great predecessor akarcrya who has specifically stated that ka is the supreme

bhagavadgt 911 avajnanti m mh mnu tanum ritam only the fools regard me as an ordinary person the fact is that no one can understand ka without rendering devotional service and without developing ka

their different planets and the lord also has a planet as stated in the twentythird verse devn devayajo ynti madbhakt ynti mm api the worshipers of the demigods go to the different planets of the demigods and those who are devotees of lord ka go to the kaloka planet although this is clearly stated the foolish impersonalists still maintain that the lord is formless and that these forms are impositions from the study of the gt does it appear that the demigods and their abodes are impersonal clearly neither the demigods nor ka the supreme personality of godhead are impersonal they are all persons lord ka is the supreme personality of godhead and he has his own planet and the demigods have theirs therefore the monistic contention that ultimate truth is formless and that form is imposed does not hold true it is clearly stated here that it is not imposed from the bhagavadgt we can clearly understand that the forms of the demigods and the form of the supreme lord are simultaneously existing and that lord ka is saccidnanda eternal blissful knowledge the vedas also confirm that the supreme absolute truth is nandamayo bhyst or by nature full of blissful pleasure and that he is the reservoir of unlimited auspicious qualities and in the gt the lord says that although he is aja unborn he still appears these are the facts that we should understand from the bhagavadgt we cannot

individual soul is also called brahman arjuna also inquires about tm which refers to body soul and mind according to the vedic dictionary tm refers to the mind soul body and senses also arjuna has

the administrative demigods both indra and viu are worshiped by yaja performances but here arjuna asks who is actually the lord of yaja sacrifice and how the lord is residing within the body of the living entity arjuna addresses the lord as madhusdana because ka once killed a demon named madhu actually these questions which are of the nature of doubts should not have arisen in the mind of arjuna because arjuna is a ka conscious devotee therefore these doubts are like demons since ka is so expert in killing demons arjuna here addresses him as madhusdana so copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved that ka might kill the demonic doubts that arise in arjunas mind now the word prayakle in this verse is very significant because whatever we do in life will be tested at the time of death arjuna is very anxious to know of those who are constantly engaged in ka consciousness what should be their position at that final moment at the time of death all the bodily functions are disrupted and the mind is not in a proper condition thus disturbed by the bodily situation one may not be able to remember the supreme lord mahrja kulaekhara a great devotee prays my dear lord just now i am quite healthy and it is better that i die immediately so that the swan of my mind can seek entrance at the stem of your lotus feet the metaphor is used because the swan a bird

if i die immediately thinking of your lotus feet then i am sure that my performance of your devotional service will become perfect but if i have to wait for my natural death then i do not know what

the self action pertaining to the development of the material bodies of the living entities is called karma or fruitive activities purport brahman is indestructible and eternally existing and its constitution is not changed at any time but beyond brahman there is parabrahman brahman refers to the living entity and parabrahman refers to the supreme personality of godhead the constitutional position of the living entity is different from the position he takes in the material world in material consciousness his nature is to try to be the lord of matter but in spiritual consciousness ka consciousness his position is to serve the supreme when the living entity is in material consciousness he has to take on various bodies in the material world that is called karma or varied creation by the force of material consciousness in vedic literature the living entity is called jvtm and brahman but he is never called parabrahman the living entity jvtm takes different positionssometimes he merges into the dark material nature and identifies himself with matter and sometimes he identifies himself with the superior spiritual nature therefore he is called the supreme lords marginal energy according to his identification with material or spiritual nature he receives a copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved material or spiritual body in material nature he may take a body from any of the 8400000 species of life but in spiritual nature he has only one body in material nature he is manifested sometimes as a man demigod animal beast bird etc according to his karma to attain material heavenly planets and enjoy their facilities he sometimes performs sacrifices yaja but when his merit is exhausted he returns to earth again in the form of a man this process is called karma the chndogya upaniad describes the vedic sacrificial process on the sacrificial altar five kinds of offerings are made into five kinds of fire the five kinds of fire are conceived of as the heavenly planets clouds the earth man and woman and the five kinds of sacrificial offerings are faith the enjoyer on the moon rain grains and semen in the process of sacrifice the living entity makes specific sacrifices to attain specific heavenly planets and consequently reaches them when the merit of sacrifice is exhausted the living entity descends to earth in the form of rain then takes on the form of grains and the grains are eaten by man and transformed into semen which impregnates a woman and thus the living entity once again attains the human form to perform sacrifice and so repeat the same cycle in this way the living entity perpetually comes and goes on the material path the ka conscious person however avoids such sacrifices he takes directly to ka consciousness and thereby prepares himself to return to godhead impersonalist commentators on the bhagavadgt unreasonably assume that brahman takes the form of jva in the material world and to substantiate this they refer to chapter fifteen verse 7 of the gt but in this verse the lord also speaks of the living entity as an eternal fragment of myself the fragment of god the living entity may fall down into the material world but the supreme lord acyuta never falls down therefore this assumption that the supreme brahman assumes the form of jva is not acceptable it is important to remember that in vedic literature brahman the living entity is distinguished from parabrahman the supreme lord text 4 copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved aidaauta arae aav

meditate on something impersonal or void that is very difficult the process of thinking of ka however is very easy and is factually stated herein first of all the lord is purua a personwe think of the person rma and the person ka and whether one thinks of rma or of ka what he is like is described in this verse of bhagavadgt the lord is kavi that is he knows past present and future and therefore knows everything he is the oldest personality because he is the origin of everything everything is born out of him he is also the supreme controller of the universe and he is the maintainer and instructor of humanity he is smaller than the smallest the living entity is one tenthousandth part of the tip of a hair but the lord is so inconceivably small that he enters into the heart of this particle therefore he is called smaller than the smallest as the supreme he can enter into the atom and into the heart of the smallest and control him as the supersoul although so small he is still allpervading and is maintaining everything by him all these planetary systems are sustained we often wonder how these big planets are floating in the air it is stated here that the supreme lord by his inconceivable energy is sustaining all these big planets and systems of galaxies the word acintya inconceivable is very significant in this connection gods energy is beyond our conception beyond our thinking jurisdiction and is therefore copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved called inconceivable acintya who can argue this point he pervades this material world and yet is beyond it we cannot comprehend even this material world which is insignificant compared to the spiritual worldso how can we comprehend what is beyond acintya means that which is beyond this

practice acakrayoga the lord explains the process in the following verses the lord says that brahman although one without a second has various manifestations and features especially for the impersonalists the akara or okrathe syllable ois identical with brahman ka here explains the impersonal brahman in which the renounced order of sages enter in the vedic system of knowledge students from the very beginning are taught to vibrate o and learn of the ultimate impersonal brahman by living with the spiritual master in complete celibacy in this way they realize two of brahmans features this practice is very essential for the students advancement in spiritual life but at the moment such brahmacr unmarried copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved celibate life is not at all possible the social construction of the world has changed so much that there is no possibility of ones practicing celibacy from the beginning of student life throughout the world there are many institutions for different departments of knowledge but there is no recognized institution where students can be educated in the brahmacr principles unless one practices celibacy advancement in spiritual life is very difficult therefore lord caitanya has announced according to the scriptural injunctions for this age of kali that in this age no process of realizing the supreme

in bhaktiyoga previous verses have mentioned four different kinds of devoteesthe distressed the inquisitive those who seek material gain and the speculative philosophers different processes of liberation have also been described karmayoga jnayoga and hahayoga the principles of these yoga systems have some bhakti added but this verse particularly mentions pure bhaktiyoga without any mixture of jna karma or haha as indicated by the word ananyacet in pure bhaktiyoga the devotee desires nothing but ka a pure devotee does not desire promotion to heavenly planets nor does he seek oneness with the brahmajyoti or salvation or liberation from material entanglement a pure devotee does not desire anything in the caitanyacaritmta the pure devotee is called nikma which means he has no desire for selfinterest perfect peace belongs to him alone not to them who strive for personal gain whereas a jnayog karmayog or hahayog has his own selfish interests a perfect devotee has no desire other than to please the supreme personality of godhead therefore the lord says that for anyone who is unflinchingly devoted to him he is easy to attain a pure devotee always engages in devotional service to ka in one of his various personal features ka has various plenary expansions and incarnations such as rma and nsiha and a devotee can choose to fix his mind in loving service to any of these transcendental forms of the supreme lord such a devotee meets with none of the problems that plague the practitioners of other yogas bhaktiyoga is very simple and pure and easy to perform one can begin simply by chanting hare ka the lord is merciful copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved to all but as we have already explained he is especially inclined toward those who always serve him without deviation the lord helps such devotees in various ways as stated in the vedas kaha upaniad 1223 yam evaia vute tena labhyas tasyaia tm vivute tanu svm one who is fully surrendered and engaged in the devotional service of the supreme lord can understand the supreme lord as he is and as stated in bhagavadgt 1010 dadmi buddhiyoga tam the lord gives such a devotee sufficient intelligence so that ultimately the devotee can attain him in his spiritual kingdom the special qualification of the pure devotee is that he is always thinking of ka without deviation and without considering the time or place there should be no impediments he should be able to carry out his service anywhere and at any time some say that the devotee should remain in holy places like vndvana or some holy town where the lord lived but a pure devotee can live anywhere and create the atmosphere of vndvana by his devotional service it was r advaita who told lord caitanya wherever you are o lordthere is vndvana as indicated by the words satatam and nityaa which mean always regularly or every day a pure devotee constantly remembers ka and meditates upon him these are qualifications of the pure devotee for whom the lord is most easily attainable bhaktiyoga is the system that the gt recommends above all others generally the bhaktiyogs are engaged in five different ways 1 ntabhakta engaged in devotional service in neutrality 2 dsyabhakta engaged in devotional service as servant 3 skhyabhakta engaged as friend 4 vtsalyabhakta engaged as parent and 5 mdhuryabhakta engaged as conjugal lover of the supreme lord in any of these ways the pure devotee is always constantly engaged in the transcendental loving service of the supreme lord and cannot forget the supreme lord and so

devotional service is not bereft of the results derived from studying the vedas performing austere sacrifices giving charity or pursuing philosophical and fruitive activities simply by performing devotional service he attains all these and at the end he reaches the supreme eternal abode purport this verse is the summation of the seventh and eighth chapters which copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved particularly deal with ka consciousness and devotional service one has to study the vedas under the guidance of the spiritual master and undergo many austerities and penances while living under his care a brahmacr has to live in the home of the spiritual master just like a servant and he must beg alms from door to door and bring them to the spiritual master he takes food only under the masters order and if the master neglects to call the student for food that day the student fasts these are some of the vedic principles for observing brahmacarya after the student studies the vedas under the master for a period from five to twenty years he may become a man of perfect character study of the vedas is not meant for the recreation of armchair speculators but for the formation of character after this training the brahmacr is allowed to enter into household life and marry when he is a householder he has to perform many sacrifices so that he may achieve further enlightenment he must also give charity according to the country time and candidate discriminating among charity in goodness in passion and in ignorance as described in bhagavadgt then after retiring from household life upon accepting the order of vnaprastha he undergoes severe penancesliving in forests dressing with tree bark not shaving etc by carrying out the orders of brahmacarya householder life vnaprastha and finally sannysa one becomes elevated to the perfectional stage of life some are then elevated to the heavenly kingdoms and when they become even more advanced they are liberated in the spiritual sky either in the impersonal brahmajyoti or in the vaikuha planets or kaloka this is the path outlined by vedic literatures the beauty of ka consciousness however is that by one stroke by engaging in devotional service one can surpass all the rituals of the different orders of life the words ida viditv indicate that one should understand the instructions given by r ka in this chapter and the seventh chapter of bhagavadgt one should try to understand these chapters not by scholarship or mental speculation but by hearing them in association with devotees chapters seven through twelve are the essence of bhagavadgt the first six and the last six chapters are like coverings for the middle six chapters which copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved are especially protected by the lord if one is fortunate enough to understand bhagavadgtespecially these middle six chaptersin the association of devotees then his life at once becomes glorified beyond all penances sacrifices charities speculations etc for one can achieve all the results of these activities simply by ka consciousness one who has a little faith in bhagavadgt should learn bhagavadgt from a devotee because in the beginning of the fourth chapter it is stated clearly that bhagavadgt can be understood only by devotees no one else can perfectly understand the purpose of bhagavadgt one should therefore learn bhagavadgt from a devotee of ka not from mental speculators this is a sign of faith when one searches for a devotee and finally gets a devotees association one actually begins to study and understand bhagavadgt by advancement in the association of the devotee one is placed in devotional service and this service dispels all ones misgivings about ka or god and kas activities form pastimes name and other features after these misgivings have been perfectly cleared away one becomes fixed in ones study then one relishes the study of bhagavadgt and attains the state of feeling always ka conscious in the advanced stage one falls completely in love with ka this highest perfectional stage of life enables the devotee to be transferred to kas abode in the spiritual sky goloka vndvana where the devotee becomes eternally happy thus end the bhaktivedanta purports to the eighth chapter of the rmad bhagavadgt in

enlightened this hearing process is recommended in the rmadbhgavatam the messages of the supreme personality of godhead are full of potencies and these potencies can be realized if topics regarding the supreme godhead copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved are discussed amongst devotees this cannot be achieved by the association of mental speculators or academic scholars for it is realized knowledge the devotees are constantly engaged in the supreme lords service the lord understands the mentality and sincerity of a particular living entity who is engaged in ka consciousness and gives him the intelligence to understand the science of ka in the association of devotees discussion of ka is very potent and if a fortunate person has such association and tries to assimilate the knowledge then he will surely make advancement toward spiritual realization lord ka in order to encourage arjuna to higher and higher elevation in his potent service describes in this ninth chapter matters more confidential than any he has already disclosed the very beginning of bhagavadgt the first chapter is more or less an introduction to the rest of the book and in the second and third chapters the spiritual knowledge described is called confidential topics discussed in the seventh and eighth chapters are specifically related to devotional service and because they bring enlightenment in ka consciousness they are called more confidential but the matters which are described in the ninth chapter deal with unalloyed pure devotion therefore this is called the most confidential one who is situated in the most confidential knowledge of ka is naturally transcendental he therefore has no material pangs although he is in the material world in the bhaktirasmtasindhu it is said that although one who has a sincere desire to render loving service to the supreme lord is situated in the conditional state of material existence he is to be considered liberated similarly we shall find in the bhagavadgt tenth chapter that anyone who is engaged in that way is a liberated person now this first verse has specific significance the words ida jnam this knowledge refer to pure devotional service which consists of nine different activities hearing chanting remembering serving worshiping praying obeying maintaining friendship and surrendering everything by the practice of these nine elements of devotional service one is elevated to spiritual consciousness ka consciousness when ones heart is thus cleared of material contamination one can understand this science of ka simply to understand that a living entity is not material is not sufficient that may be copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved the beginning of spiritual realization but one should recognize the difference between activities of the body and the spiritual activities of one who understands that he is not the body in the seventh chapter we have already discussed the opulent potency of the supreme personality of godhead his different energies the inferior and superior natures and all this material manifestation now in chapter nine the glories of the lord will be delineated the sanskrit word anasyave in this verse is also very significant generally the commentators even if they are highly scholarly are all envious of ka the supreme personality of godhead even the most erudite scholars write on bhagavadgt very inaccurately because they are envious of ka their commentaries are useless the commentaries given by devotees of the lord are bona fide no one can explain bhagavadgt or give perfect knowledge of ka if he is envious one who criticizes the character of ka without knowing him is a fool so such commentaries should be very carefully avoided for one who understands that ka is the supreme personality of godhead the pure and transcendental personality these chapters will be very beneficial text 2 rajaiva rajagau paivaimadmautamama patyaaavgama

perception of the self by realization it is the perfection of religion it is everlasting and it is joyfully performed purport this chapter of bhagavadgt is called the king of education because it is the essence of all doctrines and philosophies explained before among the principal philosophers in india are gautama kada kapila yjavalkya ilya and vaivnara and finally there is vysadeva the author of the vedntastra so there is no dearth of knowledge in the field of philosophy or transcendental knowledge now the lord says that this ninth chapter is the king of all such knowledge the essence of all knowledge that can be derived from the study of the vedas and different kinds of philosophy it is the most confidential because confidential or transcendental knowledge involves understanding the difference between the soul and the body and the king of all confidential knowledge culminates in devotional service generally people are not educated in this confidential knowledge they are educated in external knowledge as far as ordinary education is concerned people are involved with so many departments politics sociology physics chemistry mathematics astronomy engineering etc there are so many departments of knowledge all over the world and many huge universities but there is unfortunately no university or educational institution where the science of the spirit soul is instructed yet the soul is the most important part of the body without the presence of the soul the body has no value still people are placing great stress on the bodily necessities of life not caring for the vital soul the bhagavadgt especially from the second chapter on stresses the copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved importance of the soul in the very beginning the lord says that this body is perishable and that the soul is not perishable antavanta ime deh nityasyokt arria that is a confidential part of knowledge simply knowing that the spirit soul is different from this body and that its nature is immutable indestructible and eternal but that gives no positive information about the soul sometimes people are under the impression that the soul is different from the body and that when the body is finished or one is liberated from the body the soul remains in a void and becomes impersonal but actually that is not the fact how can the soul which is so active within this body be inactive after being liberated from the body it is always active if it is eternal then it is eternally active and its activities in the spiritual kingdom are the most confidential part of spiritual knowledge these activities of the spirit soul are therefore indicated here as constituting the king of all knowledge the most confidential part of all knowledge this knowledge is the purest form of all activities as explained in vedic literature in the padma pura mans sinful activities have been analyzed and are shown to be the results of sin after sin those who are engaged in fruitive activities are entangled in different stages and forms of sinful reactions for instance when the seed of a particular tree is sown the tree does not appear immediately to grow it takes some time it is first a small sprouting plant then it assumes the form of a tree then it flowers and bears fruit and when it is complete the flowers and fruits are enjoyed by persons who have sown the seed of the tree similarly a man performs a sinful act and like a seed it takes time to fructify there are different stages the sinful action may have already stopped within the individual but the results or the fruit of that sinful action are still to be enjoyed there are sins which are still in the form of a seed and there are others which are already fructified and are giving us fruit which we are enjoying as distress and pain as explained in the twentyeighth verse of the seventh chapter a person who has completely ended the reactions of all sinful activities and who is fully engaged in pious activities being freed from the duality of this material world becomes engaged in devotional service to the supreme personality of godhead ka in other words those who are actually engaged in the copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved devotional service of the supreme lord are already freed from all reactions this statement is confirmed in the padma pura aprrabdhaphala ppa ka bja phalonmukham krameaiva pralyeta viubhaktirattmanm for those who are engaged in the devotional service of the supreme personality of godhead all sinful reactions whether fructified in the stock or in the form of a seed gradually vanish therefore the purifying potency of devotional service is very strong and it is called pavitram uttamam the purest uttama means transcendental tamas means this material world or darkness and uttama means that which is transcendental to material activities devotional activities are never to be considered material although sometimes it appears that devotees are engaged just like ordinary men one who can see and is familiar with devotional service will know that they are not material activities they are all spiritual and devotional uncontaminated by the material modes of nature it is said that the execution of devotional service is so perfect that one can perceive the results directly this direct result is actually perceived and we have practical experience that any person who is chanting the holy names of ka hare ka hare ka ka ka hare hare hare rma hare rma rma rma hare hare in course of chanting without offenses feels some transcendental pleasure and very quickly becomes purified of all material contamination this is actually seen furthermore if one engages not only in hearing but in trying to broadcast the message of devotional activities as well or if he engages himself in helping the missionary activities of ka consciousness he gradually feels spiritual progress this advancement in spiritual life does not depend on any kind of previous education or qualification the method itself is so pure that by simply engaging in it one becomes pure in the vedntastra 3226 this is also described in the following words praka ca karmay abhyst devotional service is so potent that simply by copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved engaging in the activities of devotional service one becomes enlightened without a doubt a practical example of this can be seen in the previous life of nrada who in that life happened to be the son of a maidservant he had no education nor was he born into a high family but when his mother was engaged in serving great devotees nrada also became engaged and sometimes in the absence of his mother he would serve the great devotees himself nrada personally says ucchialepn anumodito dvijai sakt sma bhuje tadapstakilbia eva pravttasya viuddhacetasas taddharma evtmaruci prajyate in this verse from rmadbhgavatam 1525 nrada describes his previous life to his disciple vysadeva he says that while engaged as a boy servant for those purified devotees during the four months of their stay he was intimately associating with them sometimes those sages left remnants of food on their dishes and the boy who would wash their dishes wanted to taste the remnants so he asked the great devotees for their permission and when they gave it nrada ate those remnants and consequently became freed from all sinful reactions as he went on eating he gradually became as purehearted as the sages the great devotees relished the taste of unceasing devotional service to the lord by hearing and chanting and nrada gradually developed the same taste nrada says further tatrnvaha kakath pragyatm anugraheava manohar t raddhay me nupada vivata priyaravasy aga mambhavad ruci by associating with the sages nrada got the taste for hearing and chanting the glories of the lord and he developed a great desire for devotional service therefore as described in the vedntastra praka ca karmay abhyst if one is engaged simply in the acts of devotional service everything is revealed to him automatically and he can understand this is called pratyaka directly copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved perceived the word dharmyam means the path of religion nrada was actually a son of a maidservant he had no opportunity to go to school he was simply assisting his mother and fortunately his mother rendered some service to the devotees the child nrada also got the opportunity and simply by association achieved the highest goal of all religion the highest goal of all religion is devotional service as stated in rmadbhgavatam sa vai pus paro dharmo yato bhaktir adhokaje religious people generally do not know that the highest perfection of religion is the attainment of devotional service as we have already discussed in regard to the last verse of chapter eight vedeu yajeu tapasu caiva generally vedic knowledge is required for selfrealization but here although nrada never went to the school of the spiritual master and was not educated in the vedic principles he acquired the highest results of vedic study this process is so potent that even without performing the religious process regularly one can be raised to the highest perfection how is this possible this is also confirmed in vedic literature cryavn puruo veda one who is in association with great cryas even if he is not educated or has never studied the vedas can become familiar with all the knowledge necessary for realization the process of devotional service is a very happy one susukham why devotional service consists of ravaa krtana vio sb 7523 so one can simply hear the chanting of the glories of the lord or can attend philosophical lectures on transcendental knowledge given by authorized cryas simply by sitting one can learn then one can eat the remnants of the food offered to god nice palatable dishes in every state devotional service is joyful one can execute devotional service even in the most povertystricken condition the lord says patra pupa phala toyam he is ready to accept from the devotee any kind of offering never mind what even a leaf a flower a bit of fruit or a little water which are all available in every part of the world can be offered by any person regardless of social position and will be accepted if offered with love there are many instances in history simply by tasting the tulas leaves offered to the lotus feet of the lord great sages like sanatkumra became great devotees therefore the devotional process is very nice and it copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved can be executed in a happy mood god accepts only the love with which things are offered to him it is said here that this devotional service is eternally existing it is not as the myvd philosophers claim although they sometimes take to socalled devotional service their idea is that as long as they are not liberated they will continue their devotional service but at the end when they become liberated they will become one with god such temporary timeserving devotional service is not accepted as pure devotional service actual devotional service continues even after liberation when the devotee goes to the spiritual planet in the kingdom of god he is also engaged there in serving the supreme lord he does not try to become one with the supreme lord as will be seen in bhagavadgt actual devotional service begins after liberation after one is liberated when one is situated in the brahman position brahmabhta ones devotional service begins sama sarveu bhteu madbhakti labhate parm no one can understand the supreme personality of godhead by executing karmayoga jnayoga agayoga or any other yoga independently by these yogic methods one may make a little progress toward bhaktiyoga but without coming to the stage of devotional service one cannot understand what is the personality of godhead in the rmadbhgavatam it is also confirmed that when one becomes purified by executing the process of devotional service especially by hearing rmadbhgavatam or bhagavadgt from realized souls then he can understand the science of ka or the science of god eva prasannamanaso bhagavadbhakti yogata when ones heart is cleared of all nonsense then one can understand what god is thus the process of devotional service of ka consciousness is the king of all education and the king of all confidential knowledge it is the purest form of religion and it can be executed joyfully without difficulty therefore one should adopt it text 3 adaanaa pauza damarsyaasya parntapa copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved apaapya maa inavtarntae matyausasaarvtmarina 3 araddadhn

o conqueror of enemies therefore they return to the path of birth and death in this material world purport the faithless cannot accomplish this process of devotional service that is the purport of this verse faith is created by association with devotees unfortunate people even after hearing all the evidence of vedic literature from great personalities still have no faith in god they are hesitant and cannot stay fixed in the devotional service of the lord thus faith is a most important factor for progress in ka consciousness in the caitanyacaritmta it is said that faith is the complete conviction that simply by serving the supreme lord r ka one can achieve all perfection that is called real faith as stated in the rmadbhgavatam 43114 yath taror mlaniecanena tpyanti tatskandhabhujopakh propahrc ca yathendriy copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved tathaiva sarvrhaam acyutejy by giving water to the root of a tree one satisfies its branches twigs and leaves and by supplying food to the stomach one satisfies all the senses of the body similarly by engaging in the transcendental service of the supreme lord one automatically satisfies all the demigods and all other living entities therefore after reading bhagavadgt one should promptly come to the conclusion of bhagavadgt one should give up all other engagements and adopt the service of the supreme lord ka the personality of godhead if one is convinced of this philosophy of life that is faith now the development of that faith is the process of ka consciousness there are three divisions of ka conscious men in the third class are those who have no faith even if they are officially engaged in devotional service they cannot achieve the highest perfectional stage most probably they will slip after some time they may become engaged but because they havent complete conviction and faith it is very difficult for them to continue in ka consciousness we have practical experience in discharging our missionary activity that some people come and apply themselves to ka consciousness with some hidden motive and as soon as they are economically a little well situated they give up this process and take to their old ways again it is only by faith that one can advance in ka consciousness as far as the development of faith is concerned one who is well versed in the literatures of devotional service and has attained the stage of firm faith is called a firstclass person in ka consciousness and in the second class are those who are not very advanced in understanding the devotional scriptures but who automatically have firm faith that kabhakti or service to ka is the best course and so in good faith have taken it up thus they are superior to the third class who have neither perfect knowledge of the scriptures nor good faith but by association and simplicity are trying to follow the thirdclass person in ka consciousness may fall down but when one is in the second class he does not fall down and for the firstclass person in ka consciousness there is no chance of falling down one in the first class will surely make progress and achieve the result at the end as far as the thirdclass person in ka consciousness is concerned although he has faith in the copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved conviction that devotional service to ka is very good he has not yet gained adequate knowledge of ka through the scriptures like rmadbhgavatam and bhagavadgt sometimes these thirdclass persons in ka consciousness have some tendency toward karmayoga and jnayoga and sometimes they are disturbed but as soon as the infection of karmayoga or jnayoga is vanquished they become secondclass or firstclass persons in ka consciousness faith in ka is also divided into three stages and described in rmadbhgavatam firstclass attachment secondclass attachment and thirdclass attachment are also explained in rmadbhgavatam in the eleventh canto those who have no faith even after hearing about ka and the excellence of devotional service who think that it is simply eulogy find the path very difficult even if they are supposedly engaged in devotional service for them there is very little hope of gaining perfection thus faith is very important in the discharge of devotional service text 4 mayaa tataimad sav

cannot be understood by material senses only to one who is engaged in pure devotional service under proper guidance is he revealed in the brahmasahit 538 it is stated premjanacchuritabhaktivilocanena santa sadaiva hdayeu vilokayanti one can see the supreme personality of godhead govinda always within himself and outside himself if one has developed the transcendental loving attitude towards him thus for people in general he is not visible here it is said that although he is allpervading everywhere present he is not conceivable by the material senses this is indicated here by the word avyaktamrtin but actually although we cannot see him everything is resting in him as we have discussed in the seventh chapter the entire material cosmic manifestation is only a combination of his two different energiesthe superior spiritual energy and the inferior material energy just as the sunshine is spread all over the universe the energy of the lord is spread all over the creation and everything is resting in that energy yet one should not conclude that because he is spread all over he has lost his personal existence to refute such an argument the lord says i am everywhere and everything is in me but still i am aloof for example a king heads a government which is but the manifestation of the kings energy the different governmental departments are nothing but the energies of the king copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved and each department is resting on the kings power but still one cannot expect the king to be present in every department personally that is a crude example similarly all the manifestations that we see and everything that exists both in this material world and in the spiritual world are resting on the energy of the supreme personality of godhead the creation takes place by the diffusion of his different energies and as stated in the bhagavadgt viabhyham ida ktsnam he is everywhere present by his personal representation the diffusion of his different energies text 5 na c matsqaaina autaaina paxya mae yaaegamaerma autaa c autasqaae mamaatmaa autaaavna 5 na ca matsthni bhtni paya me yogam aivaram bhtabhn

bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved purport the lord says that everything is resting on him matsthni sarvabhtni this should not be misunderstood the lord is not directly concerned with the maintenance and sustenance of this material manifestation sometimes we see a picture of atlas holding the globe on his shoulders he seems to be very tired holding this great earthly planet such an image should not be entertained in connection with kas upholding this created universe he says that although everything is resting on him he is aloof the planetary systems are floating in space and this space is the energy of the supreme lord but he is different from space he is differently situated therefore the lord says although they are situated on my inconceivable energy as the supreme personality of godhead i am aloof from them this is the inconceivable opulence of the lord in the nirukti vedic dictionary it is said yujyate nena durghaeu kryeu the supreme lord is performing inconceivably wonderful pastimes displaying his energy his person is full of different potent energies and his determination is itself actual fact in this way the personality of godhead is to be understood we may think of doing something but there are so many impediments and sometimes it is not possible to do as we like but when ka wants to do something simply by his willing everything is performed so perfectly that one cannot imagine how it is being done the lord explains this fact although he is the maintainer and sustainer of the entire material manifestation he does not touch this material manifestation simply by his supreme will everything is created everything is sustained everything is maintained and everything is annihilated there is no difference between his mind and himself as there is a difference between ourselves and our present material mind because he is absolute spirit simultaneously the lord is present in everything yet the common man cannot understand how he is also present personally he is different from this material manifestation yet everything is resting on him this is explained here as yogam aivaram the mystic power of the supreme personality of godhead copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved text 6 yaqaakaxaisqataae inatya vayau savragaae mahana taqaa savaria autaaina matsqaanaqtyaupadaarya 6 yathkasthito nitya

for the ordinary person it is almost inconceivable how the huge material creation is resting in him but the lord is giving an example which may help us to understand the sky may be the biggest manifestation we can conceive and in that sky the wind or air is the biggest manifestation in the cosmic world the movement of the air influences the movements of everything but although the wind is great it is still situated within the sky the wind is not beyond the sky similarly all the wonderful cosmic manifestations are existing by the supreme will of god and all of them are subordinate to that supreme will as we generally say not a blade of grass moves without the will of the copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved supreme personality of godhead thus everything is moving under his will by his will everything is being created everything is being maintained and everything is being annihilated still he is aloof from everything as the sky is always aloof from the activities of the wind in the upaniads it is stated yadbh vta pavate it is out of the fear of the supreme lord that the wind is blowing taittirya upaniad 281 in the bhadrayaka upaniad 389 it is stated etasya v akarasya prasane grgi sryacandramasau vidhtau tihata etasya v akarasya prasane grgi dyvpthivyau vidhtau tihata by the supreme order under the superintendence of the supreme

sambhtaklacakro govindam dipurua tam aha bhajmi this is a description of the movement of the sun it is said that the sun is considered to be one of the eyes of the supreme lord and that it has immense potency to diffuse heat and light still it is moving in its prescribed orbit by the order and the supreme will of govinda so from the vedic literature we can find evidence that this material manifestation which appears to us to be very wonderful and great is under the complete control of the supreme personality of godhead this will be further explained in the later verses of this chapter

again enters as garbhodakay viu each universe is in that way created he still further manifests himself as krodakay viu and that viu enters into everythingeven into the minute atom this fact is explained here he enters into everything now as far as the living entities are concerned they are impregnated into this material nature and as a result of their past deeds they take different positions thus the activities of this material world begin the activities of the copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved different species of living beings are begun from the very moment of the creation it is not that all is evolved the different species of life are created immediately along with the universe men animals beasts birdseverything is simultaneously created because whatever desires the living entities had at the last annihilation are again manifested it is clearly indicated here by the word avaam that the living entities have nothing to do with this process the state of being in their past life in the past creation is simply manifested again and all this is done simply by his will this is the inconceivable potency of the supreme personality of god and after creating different species of life he has no connection with them the creation takes place to accommodate the inclinations of the various living entities and so the lord does not become

sitting as if neutral the example can be given of a highcourt judge sitting on his bench by his order so many things are happeningsomeone is being hanged someone is being put into jail someone is awarded a huge amount of wealthbut still he is neutral he has nothing to do with all that gain and loss similarly the lord is always neutral although he has his hand in every sphere of activity in the

supreme director the supreme lord is the supreme will and the background of this material manifestation but the management is being conducted by material nature ka also states in bhagavadgt that of all of the living entities in different forms and species i am the father the father gives seeds to the womb of the mother for the child and similarly the supreme lord by his mere glance injects all the living entities into the womb of material nature and they come out in their different forms and species according to their last desires and activities all these living entities although born under the glance of the supreme lord take their different bodies according to their past deeds and desires so the lord is not directly attached to this material creation he simply glances over material nature material nature is thus activated and everything is created immediately because he glances over material nature there is undoubtedly activity on the part of the supreme lord but he has nothing to do with the manifestation of the material world directly this example is given in the smti when there is a fragrant flower before someone the fragrance is touched by the smelling power of the person yet the smelling and the flower are copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved detached from one another there is a similar connection between the material world and

ajnantanot knowing mamamy bhtaof everything that be mahvaramthe supreme proprietor translation fools deride me when i descend in the human form they do not know my transcendental nature as the supreme lord of all that be purport from the other explanations of the previous verses in this chapter it is clear that the supreme personality of godhead although appearing like a human being is not a common man the personality of godhead who copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved conducts the creation maintenance and annihilation of the complete cosmic manifestation cannot be a human being yet there are many foolish men who consider ka to be merely a powerful man and nothing more actually he is the original supreme personality as is confirmed in the brahmasahit vara parama ka he is the supreme lord there are many varas controllers and one appears greater than another in the ordinary management of affairs in the material world we find some official or director and above him there is a secretary and above him a minister and above him a president each of them is a controller but one is controlled by another in the brahmasahit it is said that ka is the supreme controller there are many controllers undoubtedly both in the material and spiritual world but ka is the supreme controller vara parama ka and his body is saccidnanda nonmaterial material bodies cannot perform the wonderful acts described in previous verses his body is eternal blissful and full of knowledge although he is not a common man the foolish deride him and consider him to be a man his body is called here mnum because he is acting just like a man a friend of arjunas a politician involved in the battle of kuruketra in so many ways he is acting just like an ordinary man but actually his body is saccidnandavigraha bs 51eternal bliss and knowledge absolute this is confirmed in the vedic language also saccidnandarpya kya i offer my obeisances unto the supreme personality of

the cows saccidnandavigraham and your form is transcendental full of knowledge bliss and eternality goplatpan upaniad 135 despite the transcendental qualities of lord kas body its full bliss and knowledge there are many socalled scholars and commentators of bhagavadgt who deride ka as an ordinary man the scholar may be born an extraordinary man due to his previous good work but this conception of r ka is due to a poor fund of knowledge therefore he is called mha for only foolish persons consider ka to be an ordinary human being the copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved foolish consider ka an ordinary human being because they do not know the confidential activities of the supreme lord and his different energies they do not know that kas body is a symbol of complete knowledge and bliss that he is the proprietor of everything that be and that he can award liberation to anyone because they do not know that ka has so many transcendental qualifications they deride him nor do they know that the appearance of the supreme personality of godhead in this material world is a manifestation of his internal energy he is the master of the material energy as has been explained in several places mama my duratyay he claims that the material energy although very powerful is under his control and whoever surrenders unto him can get out of the control of this material energy if a soul surrendered to ka can get out of the influence of material energy then how can the supreme lord who conducts the creation maintenance and annihilation of the whole cosmic nature have a material body like us so this conception of ka is complete foolishness foolish persons however cannot conceive that the personality of godhead ka appearing just like an ordinary man can be the controller of all the atoms and of the gigantic manifestation of the universal form the biggest and the minutest are beyond their conception so they cannot imagine that a form like that of a human being can simultaneously control the infinite and the minute actually although he is controlling the infinite and the finite he is apart from all this manifestation it is clearly stated concerning his yogam aivaram his inconceivable transcendental energy that he can control the infinite and the finite simultaneously and that he can remain aloof from them although the foolish cannot imagine how ka who appears just like a human being can control the infinite and the finite those who are pure devotees accept this for they know that ka is the supreme personality of godhead therefore they completely surrender unto him and engage in ka consciousness devotional service of the lord there are many controversies between the impersonalists and the personalists about the lords appearance as a human being but if we consult bhagavadgt and rmadbhgavatam the authoritative texts for understanding the science of ka then we can understand that ka is the copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved supreme personality of godhead he is not an ordinary man although he appeared on this earth as an ordinary human in the rmadbhgavatam first canto first chapter when the sages headed by aunaka inquired about the activities of ka they said ktavn kila karmi saha rmea keava atimartyni bhagavn gha kapaamua lord r ka the supreme personality of godhead along with balarma played like a human being and so masked he performed many superhuman acts bhg 1120 the lords appearance as a man bewilders the foolish no human being could perform the wonderful acts that ka performed while he was present on this earth when ka appeared before his father and mother vasudeva and devak he appeared with four hands but after the prayers of the parents he transformed himself into an ordinary child as stated in the bhgavatam 10346 babhva prkta iu he became just like an ordinary child an ordinary human being now here again it is indicated that the lords appearance as an ordinary human being is one of the features of his transcendental body in the eleventh chapter of bhagavadgt also it is stated that arjuna prayed to see kas form of four hands tenaiva rpea caturbhujena after revealing this form ka when petitioned by arjuna again assumed his original humanlike form mnua rpam these different features of the supreme lord are certainly not those of an ordinary human being some of those who deride ka and who are infected with the myvd philosophy quote the following verse from the rmadbhgavatam 32921 to prove that ka is just an ordinary man aha sarveu bhteu bhttmvasthita sad the supreme is present in every living entity we should better take note of this particular verse from the vaiava cryas like jva gosvm and vivantha cakravart hkura instead of following the interpretation of unauthorized persons who deride ka jva gosvm commenting on this verse says that ka in his plenary expansion as copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved paramtm is situated in the moving and the nonmoving entities as the supersoul so any neophyte devotee who simply gives his attention to the arcmrti the form of the supreme lord in the temple and does not respect other living entities is uselessly worshiping the form of the lord in the temple there are three kinds of devotees of the lord and the neophyte is in the lowest stage the neophyte devotee gives more attention to the deity in the temple than to other devotees so vivantha cakravart hkura warns that this sort of mentality should be corrected a devotee should see that because ka is present in everyones heart as paramtm every body is the embodiment or the temple of the supreme lord so as one offers respect to the temple of the lord he should similarly properly respect each and every body in which the paramtm dwells everyone should therefore be given proper respect and should not be neglected there are also many impersonalists who deride temple worship they say that since god is everywhere why should one restrict himself to temple worship but if god is everywhere is he not in the temple or in the deity although the personalist and the impersonalist will fight with one another perpetually a perfect devotee in ka consciousness knows that although ka is the supreme personality he is allpervading as confirmed in the brahmasahit although his personal

their hopes for liberation their fruitive activities and their culture of knowledge are all defeated purport there are many devotees who assume themselves to be in ka consciousness and devotional service but at heart do not accept the supreme personality of godhead ka as the absolute truth for them the fruit of devotional servicegoing back to godheadwill never be tasted similarly those who are engaged in fruitive pious activities and who are ultimately hoping to be liberated from this material entanglement will never be successful either because they deride the supreme personality of godhead ka in other words persons who mock ka are to be understood to be demonic or atheistic as described in the seventh chapter of bhagavadgt such demonic miscreants never surrender to ka therefore their mental speculations to arrive at the absolute truth bring them to the false conclusion that the ordinary living entity and ka are one and the same with such a false conviction they think that the body of any human being is now simply covered by material nature and that as soon as one is liberated from this material body there is no difference between god and himself this attempt to become one with ka will be baffled because of delusion such atheistic and demoniac cultivation of spiritual knowledge is always futile that is the indication of this verse for such persons cultivation of the knowledge in the copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved vedic literature like the vedntastra and the upaniads is always baffled it is a great offense therefore to consider ka the supreme personality of godhead to be an ordinary man those who do so are certainly deluded because they cannot understand the eternal form of ka the bhadviusmti clearly states yo vetti bhautika deha kasya paramtmana sa sarvasmd bahikrya rautasmrtavidhnata mukha tasyvalokypi sacela snnam caret one who considers the body of ka to be material should be driven out from all rituals and activities of the ruti and the smti and if one by chance sees his face one should at once take bath in the ganges to rid himself of infection people jeer at ka because they are envious of the supreme personality of godhead their destiny is certainly to take birth after birth in the species of atheistic and demoniac life perpetually their real knowledge will remain under delusion and gradually they

deluded the great souls are under the protection of the divine nature they are fully engaged in devotional service because they know me as the supreme personality of godhead original and inexhaustible purport in this verse the description of the mahtm is clearly given the first sign of the mahtm is that he is already situated in the divine nature he is not under the control of material nature and how is this effected that is explained in the seventh chapter one who surrenders unto the supreme personality of godhead r ka at once becomes freed from the control of material nature that is the qualification one can become free from the control of material nature as soon as he surrenders his soul to the supreme personality of godhead that is the preliminary formula being marginal potency as soon as the living entity is freed from the control of material nature he is put under the guidance of the spiritual nature the guidance of the spiritual nature is called daiv prakti divine nature so when one is promoted in that wayby surrendering to the supreme personality of godheadone attains to the stage of great soul mahtm the mahtm does not divert his attention to anything outside ka because he knows perfectly well that ka is the original supreme person the cause of all causes there is no doubt about it such a mahtm or great soul develops through association with other mahtms pure devotees pure devotees are not even attracted by kas other features such as the fourarmed mahviu they are simply attracted by the twoarmed form of ka they are not attracted to other features of ka nor are they copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved concerned with any form of a demigod or of a human being they meditate only upon ka in ka consciousness they are always

personality of godhead he has no other business he is always engaged in the glorification of the lord in other words he is not an impersonalist when the question of glorification is there one has to glorify the supreme lord praising his holy name his copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved eternal form his transcendental qualities and his uncommon pastimes one has to glorify all these things therefore a mahtm is attached to the supreme personality of godhead one who is attached to the impersonal feature of the supreme lord the brahmajyoti is not described as mahtm in the bhagavadgt he is described in a different way in the next verse the mahtm is always engaged in different activities of devotional service as described in the rmadbhgavatam hearing and chanting about viu not a demigod or human being that is devotion ravaa krtana vio and smaraam remembering him such a mahtm has firm determination to achieve at the ultimate end the association of the supreme lord in any one of the five transcendental rasas to achieve that success he engages all activitiesmental bodily and vocal everythingin the service of the supreme lord r ka that is called full ka consciousness in devotional service there are certain activities which are called determined such as fasting on certain days like the eleventh day of the moon ekda and on the appearance day of the lord all these rules and regulations are offered by the great cryas for those who are actually interested in getting admission into the association of the supreme personality of godhead in the transcendental world the mahtms great souls strictly observe all these rules and regulations and therefore they are sure to achieve the desired result as described in the second verse of this chapter not only is this devotional service easy but it can be performed in a happy mood one does not need to undergo any severe penance and austerity he can live this life in devotional service guided by an expert spiritual master and in any position either as a householder or a sannys or a brahmacr in any position and anywhere in the world he can perform this devotional service to the supreme

ways some of them have already been described as the distressed the financially destitute the inquisitive and those who are engaged in the cultivation of knowledge but there are others who are still lower and these are divided into three 1 he who worships himself as one with the supreme lord 2 he who concocts some form of the supreme lord and worships that and 3 he who accepts the universal form the vivarpa of the supreme personality of godhead and worships that out of the above three the lowest those who worship themselves as the supreme lord thinking themselves to be copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved monists are most predominant such people think themselves to be the supreme lord and in this mentality they worship themselves this is also a type of god worship for they can understand that they are not the material body but are actually spiritual soul at least such a sense is prominent generally the impersonalists worship the supreme lord in this way the second class includes the worshipers of the demigods those who by imagination consider any form to be the form of the supreme lord and the third class includes those who cannot conceive of anything beyond the manifestation of this material universe they consider the universe to be the supreme organism or entity and worship that the universe is also a form of the lord text 16 ah taurh

not only are our father and mother parts and parcels of ka but the creator grandmother and grandfather etc are also ka actually any living entity being part and parcel of ka is ka all the vedas therefore aim only toward ka whatever we want to know through the vedas is but a progressive step toward understanding ka that subject matter which helps us purify our constitutional position is especially ka similarly the living entity who is inquisitive to understand all vedic principles is also part and parcel of ka and as such is also ka in all the vedic mantras the word o called praava

everything is resting on kas energy therefore without kas shelter nothing can exist ka is copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved the supreme ruler because everything

the chanting of the hare ka mantra and side by side trying to understand ka in truth unfortunately those who are simply official students of the vedas become more interested in offering sacrifices to the different demigods like indra and candra by such endeavor the worshipers of different demigods are certainly purified of the contamination of the lower qualities of nature and are thereby elevated

or any other planet one can attain the desired destination by following specific vedic principles recommended for that purpose such as the process technically known as darapaurams these are vividly described in the fruitive activities portion of the vedas which recommends a specific worship of demigods situated on different heavenly planets similarly one can attain the pit planets by performing a specific yaja similarly one can go to many ghostly planets and become a yaka raka or pica pica worship is called black arts or black magic there are many men who practice this black art and they think that it is spiritualism but such activities are completely materialistic similarly a pure devotee who worships the supreme personality of godhead only achieves the planets of vaikuha and kaloka without a doubt it is very easy to understand through this important verse that if by simply worshiping the demigods one can achieve the heavenly planets or by worshiping the pits achieve the pit planets or by practicing the black arts achieve the ghostly planets why can the pure devotee not achieve the planet of ka or viu unfortunately many people have no information of these sublime planets where ka and viu live and because they do not know of them they fall down even the impersonalists fall down from the brahmajyoti the ka copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights

very easy and can be attempted even by the poorest of the poor without any kind of qualification the only qualification required in this copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved connection is to be a pure devotee of the lord it does not matter what one is or where one is situated the process is so easy that even a leaf or a little water or fruit can be offered to the supreme lord in genuine love and the lord will be pleased to accept it no one therefore can be barred from ka consciousness because it is so easy and universal who is such a fool that he does not want to be ka conscious by this simple method and thus attain the highest perfectional life of eternity bliss and knowledge ka wants only loving service and nothing more ka accepts even a little flower from his pure devotee he does not want any kind of offering from a nondevotee he is not in need of anything from anyone because he is selfsufficient and yet he accepts the offering of his devotee in an exchange of love and affection to develop ka consciousness is the highest perfection of life bhakti is mentioned twice in this verse in order to declare more emphatically that bhakti or devotional service is the only means to approach ka no other condition such as becoming a brhmaa a learned scholar a very rich man or a great philosopher can induce ka to accept some offering without the basic principle of bhakti nothing can induce the lord to agree to accept anything from anyone bhakti is never causal the process is eternal it is direct action in service to the absolute whole here lord ka having established that he is the only enjoyer the primeval lord and the real object of all sacrificial offerings reveals what types of sacrifices he desires to be offered if one wishes to engage in devotional service to the supreme in order to be purified and to reach the goal of lifethe transcendental loving service of godthen one should find out what the lord desires of him one who loves ka will give him whatever he wants and he avoids offering anything which is undesirable or unasked thus meat fish and eggs should not be offered to ka if he desired such things as offerings he would have said so instead he clearly requests that a leaf fruit flowers and water be given to him and he says of this offering i will accept it therefore we should understand that he will not accept meat fish and eggs vegetables grains fruits milk and water are the proper foods for human beings and are prescribed by lord ka himself whatever else we eat cannot be offered to him since he will not accept it thus we cannot be acting on the copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved level of loving devotion if we offer such foods in the third chapter verse thirteen r ka explains that only the remains of sacrifice are purified and fit for consumption by those who are seeking advancement in life and release from the clutches of the material entanglement those who do not make an offering of their food he says in the same verse are eating only sin in other words their every mouthful is simply deepening their involvement in the complexities of material nature but preparing nice simple vegetable dishes offering them before the picture or deity of lord ka and bowing down and praying for him to accept such a humble offering enables one to advance steadily in life to purify the body and to create fine brain tissues which will lead to clear thinking above all the offering should be made with an attitude of love ka has no need of food since he already possesses everything that be yet he will accept the offering of one who desires to please him in that way the important element in preparation in serving and in offering is to act with love for ka the impersonalist philosophers who wish to maintain that the absolute truth is without senses cannot comprehend this verse of bhagavadgt to them it is either a metaphor or proof of the mundane character of ka the speaker of the bhagavadgt but in actuality ka the supreme godhead has senses and it is stated that his senses are interchangeable in other words one sense can perform the function of any other this is what it means to say that ka is absolute lacking senses he could hardly be considered full in all opulences in the seventh chapter ka has explained that he impregnates the living entities into material nature this is done by his looking upon material nature and so in this instance kas hearing the devotees words of love in offering foodstuffs is wholly identical with his eating and actually tasting this point should be emphasized because of his absolute position his hearing is wholly identical with his eating and tasting only the devotee who accepts ka as he describes himself without interpretation can understand that the supreme absolute truth can eat food and enjoy it text 27 copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved yatkraeiz yadnaisa yauhaeiz ddaisa

of renunciation you will be liberated and come to me purport one who acts in ka consciousness under superior direction is called yukta the technical term is yuktavairagya this is further explained by rpa gosvm as follows ansaktasya viayn copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved yathrham upayujata nirbandha kasambandhe yukta vairgyam ucyate bhaktirasmtasindhu 2255 rpa gosvm says that as long as we are in this material world we have to act we cannot cease acting therefore if actions are performed and the fruits are given to ka then that is called yuktavairgya actually situated in renunciation such activities clear the mirror of the mind and as the actor gradually makes progress in spiritual realization he becomes completely surrendered to the supreme personality of godhead therefore at the end he becomes liberated and this liberation is also specified by this liberation he does not become one with the brahmajyoti but rather enters into the planet of the supreme lord it is clearly mentioned here mm upaiyasi he comes to me back home back to godhead there are five different stages of liberation and here it is specified that the devotee who has always lived his lifetime here under the direction of the supreme lord as stated has evolved to the point where he can after quitting this body go back to godhead and engage directly in the association of the supreme lord anyone who has no interest but to dedicate his life to the service of the lord is actually a sannys such a person always thinks of himself as an eternal servant dependent on the supreme will of the lord as such whatever he does he does it for the benefit of the lord whatever action he performs he performs it as service to the lord he does not give serious attention to the fruitive activities or prescribed duties mentioned in the vedas for ordinary persons it is obligatory to execute the prescribed duties mentioned in the vedas but although a pure devotee who is completely engaged in the service of the lord may sometimes appear to go against the prescribed vedic duties actually it is not so it is said therefore by vaiava authorities that even the most intelligent person cannot understand the plans and activities of a pure devotee the exact words are tra vkya kriy mudr vijeha n bujhaya caitanyacaritmta madhya 2339 a person who is thus always engaged in the service of the lord or is always thinking and planning how to serve the lord is to be considered copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved completely liberated at present and in the future his going back home back to godhead is guaranteed he is above all materialistic criticism just as ka is above all criticism text 29 samaaeh savrautaezu na mae

to him purport one may question here that if ka is equal to everyone and no one is his special friend then why does he take a special interest in the devotees who are always engaged in his transcendental service but this is not discrimination it is natural any man in this material world may be very charitably disposed yet copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved he has a special interest in his own children the lord claims that every living entityin whatever formis his son and so he provides everyone with a generous supply of the necessities of life he is just like a cloud which pours rain all over regardless of whether it falls on rock or land or water but for his devotees he gives specific attention such devotees are mentioned here they are always in ka consciousness and therefore they are always transcendentally situated in ka the very phrase ka consciousness suggests that those who are in such consciousness are living transcendentalists situated in him the lord says here distinctly mayi te they are in me naturally as a result the lord is also in them this is reciprocal this also explains the words ye yath m prapadyante ts tathaiva bhajmy aham whoever surrenders unto me proportionately i take care of him this transcendental reciprocation exists because both the lord and the devotee are conscious when a diamond is set in a golden ring it looks very nice the gold is glorified and at the same time the diamond is glorified the lord and the living entity eternally glitter and when a living entity becomes inclined to the service of the supreme lord he looks like gold the lord is a diamond and so this combination is very nice living entities in a pure state are called devotees the supreme lord becomes the devotee of his devotees if a reciprocal relationship is not present between the devotee and the lord then there is no personalist philosophy in the impersonal philosophy there is no reciprocation between the supreme and the living entity but in the personalist philosophy there is the example is often given that the lord is like a desire tree and whatever one wants from this desire tree the lord supplies but here the explanation is more complete the lord is here stated to be partial to the devotees this is the manifestation of the lords special mercy to the devotees the lords reciprocation should not be considered to be under the law of karma it belongs to the transcendental situation in which the lord and his devotees function devotional service to the lord is not an activity of this material world it is part of the spiritual world where eternity bliss and knowledge predominate copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved text 30 aipa

samyakcompletely vyavasitasituated in determination hicertainly sahe translation even if one commits the most abominable action if he is engaged in devotional service he is to be considered saintly because he is properly situated in his determination purport the word sudurcra used in this verse is very significant and we should understand it properly when a living entity is conditioned he has two kinds of activities one is conditional and the other is constitutional as for protecting the body or abiding by the rules of society and state certainly there are different activities even for the devotees in connection with the conditional life and such activities are called conditional besides these the living entity who is fully conscious of his spiritual nature and is engaged in ka consciousness or the devotional service of the lord has activities which copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved are called transcendental such activities are performed in his constitutional position and they are technically called devotional service now in the conditioned state sometimes devotional service and the conditional service in relation to the body will parallel one another but then again sometimes these activities become opposed to one another as far as possible a devotee is very cautious so that he does not do anything that could disrupt his wholesome condition he knows that perfection in his activities depends on his progressive realization of ka consciousness sometimes however it may be seen that a person in ka consciousness commits some act which may be taken as most abominable socially or politically but such a temporary falldown does not disqualify him in the rmadbhgavatam it is stated that if a person falls down but is wholeheartedly engaged in the transcendental service of the supreme lord the lord being situated within his heart purifies him and excuses him from that abomination the material contamination is so strong that even a yog fully engaged in the service of the lord sometimes becomes ensnared but ka consciousness is so strong that such an occasional falldown is at once rectified therefore the process of devotional service is always a success no one should deride a devotee for some accidental falldown from the ideal path for as explained in the next verse such occasional falldowns will be stopped in due course as soon as a devotee is completely situated in ka consciousness therefore a person who is situated in ka consciousness and is engaged with determination in the process of chanting hare ka hare ka ka ka hare hare hare rma hare rma rma rma hare hare should be considered to be in the transcendental position even if by chance or accident he is found to have fallen the words sdhur eva he is saintly are very emphatic they are a warning to the nondevotees that because of an accidental falldown a devotee should not be derided he should still be considered saintly even if he has accidentally fallen down and the word mantavya is still more emphatic if one does not follow this rule and derides a devotee for his accidental falldown then one is disobeying the order of the supreme lord the only qualification of a devotee is to be unflinchingly and exclusively engaged in devotional service copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved in the nsiha pura the following statement is given bhagavati ca harv ananyacet bhamalino pi virjate manuya na hi aakaluacchabi kadcit timiraparbhavatm upaiti candra the meaning is that even if one fully engaged in the devotional service of the lord is sometimes found engaged in abominable activities these activities should be considered to be like the spots that resemble the mark of a rabbit on the moon such spots do not become an impediment to the diffusion of moonlight similarly the accidental falldown of a devotee from the path of saintly character does not make him abominable on the other hand one should not misunderstand that a devotee in transcendental devotional service can act in all kinds of abominable ways this verse only refers to an accident due to the strong power of material connections devotional service is more or less a declaration of war against the illusory energy as long as one is not strong enough to fight the illusory energy there may be accidental falldowns but when one is strong enough he is no longer subjected to such falldowns as previously explained no one should take advantage of this verse and commit nonsense and think that he is still a devotee if he does not improve in his character by devotional service then it is to be understood that he is not a high devotee text 31 iapa avita damaartmaa xacainta inagacita kaentaeya paitajaanaqih na mae a paaxyaita 31

activities cannot become a devotee of the lord one who is not a devotee of the lord has no good qualifications whatsoever the question remains then how can a person engaged in abominable activitieseither by accident or by intentionbe a pure devotee this question may justly be raised the miscreants as stated in the seventh chapter who never come to the devotional service of the lord have no good qualifications as is stated in the rmadbhgavatam generally a devotee who is engaged in the nine kinds of devotional activities is engaged in the process of cleansing all material contamination from the heart he puts the supreme personality of godhead within his heart and all sinful contaminations are naturally washed away continuous thinking of the supreme lord makes him pure by nature according to the vedas there is a certain regulation that if one falls down from his exalted position he has to undergo certain ritualistic processes to purify himself but here there is no such condition because the purifying process is already there in the heart of the devotee due to his remembering the supreme personality of godhead constantly therefore the chanting of hare ka hare ka ka ka hare hare hare rma hare rma rma rma hare hare should be continued without stoppage copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved this will protect a devotee from all

there are not everyone is eligible for the supreme destination in the rmadbhgavatam 2418 it is copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved stated that even the lowest who are called calas dogeaters can be purified by association with a pure devotee therefore devotional service and the guidance of a pure devotee are so strong that there is no discrimination between the lower and higher classes of men anyone can take to it the most simple man taking shelter of the pure devotee can be purified by proper guidance according to the different modes of material nature men are classified in the mode of goodness brhmaas the mode of passion katriyas or administrators the mixed modes of passion and ignorance vaiyas or merchants and the mode of ignorance dras or workers those lower than them are called calas and they are born in sinful families generally the association of those born in sinful families is not accepted by the higher classes but the process of devotional service is so strong that the pure devotee of the supreme lord can enable people of all the lower classes to attain the highest perfection of life this is possible only when one takes

temporary and full of miseries not habitable for any sane gentleman this world is declared by the supreme personality of godhead to be temporary and full of miseries some philosophers especially myvd

but there is another world which is eternal this world is miserable but the other world is eternal and blissful arjuna was born in a saintly royal family to him also the lord says take to my devotional service and come quickly back to godhead back home no one should remain in this temporary world full as it is with miseries everyone should attach himself to the bosom of the supreme

being delivered from the clutches of this contaminated material world sometimes unscrupulous commentators distort the meaning of what is clearly stated here that all devotional service should be offered to the supreme personality of godhead ka unfortunately unscrupulous commentators divert the mind of the reader to that which is not at all feasible such commentators do not know that there is no difference between kas mind and ka ka is not an ordinary human being he is absolute truth his body his mind and he himself are one and absolute it is stated in the krma pura as it is quoted by bhaktisiddhnta sarasvat gosvm in his anubhya comments on caitanyacaritmta fifth chapter dill verses 4148 dehadehivibhedo ya nevare vidyate kvacit this means that there is no difference in ka the supreme lord between himself and his body but because the commentators do not know this science of ka they hide ka copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved and divide his personality from his mind or from his body although this is sheer ignorance of the science of ka some men make profit out of misleading people there are some who are demonic they also think of ka but enviously just like king kasa kas uncle he was also thinking of ka always but he thought of ka as his enemy he was always in anxiety wondering when ka would come to kill him that kind of thinking will not help us one should be thinking of ka in devotional love that is bhakti one should cultivate the knowledge of ka continuously what is that favorable cultivation it is to learn from a bona fide teacher ka is the supreme personality of godhead and we have several times explained that his body is not material but is eternal blissful knowledge this kind of talk about ka will help one become a devotee understanding ka otherwise from the wrong source will prove fruitless one should therefore engage his mind in the eternal form the primal form of ka with conviction in his heart that ka is the supreme he should engage himself in worship there are hundreds of thousands of temples in india for the worship of ka and devotional service is practiced there when such practice is made one has to offer obeisances to ka one should lower his head before the deity and engage his mind his body his activitieseverything that will make one fully absorbed in ka without deviation this will help one transfer to the kaloka one should not be deviated by unscrupulous commentators one must engage in the nine different processes of devotional service beginning with hearing and chanting about ka pure devotional service is the highest achievement of human society the seventh and eighth chapters of bhagavadgt have explained pure devotional service to the lord that is free from speculative knowledge mystic yoga and fruitive activities those who are not purely sanctified may be attracted by different features of the lord like the impersonal brahmajyoti and localized paramtm but a pure devotee directly takes to the service of the supreme lord there is a beautiful poem about ka in which it is clearly stated that any copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved person who is engaged in the worship of demigods is most unintelligent and cannot achieve at any time the supreme award of ka the devotee in the beginning may sometimes fall from the standard but still he should be considered superior to all other philosophers and yogs one who always engages in ka consciousness should be understood to be a perfectly saintly person his accidental nondevotional activities will diminish and he will soon be situated without any doubt in complete perfection the pure devotee has no actual chance to fall down because the supreme godhead personally takes care of his pure devotees therefore the intelligent person should take directly to the process of ka consciousness and happily live in this material world he will eventually receive the supreme award of ka

sages like parara muni have all accepted ka as the supreme personality of godhead now ka is instructing arjuna in more confidential knowledge of his opulences and his work previously beginning with the seventh chapter the lord has already explained his different energies and how they are acting now in this chapter he explains his specific opulences to arjuna in the previous chapter he has clearly explained his different energies to establish devotion in firm conviction again in this chapter he tells arjuna about his manifestations and various opulences the more one hears about the supreme god the more one becomes fixed in devotional service one should always hear about the lord in the association of devotees that will enhance ones devotional service discourses copyright 1998

the lord personally that he is the cause of all the demigods and sages even the demigods and great sages cannot understand ka they can understand neither his name nor his personality so what is the position of the socalled copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved scholars of this tiny planet no one can understand why this supreme god comes to earth as an ordinary human being and executes such wonderful uncommon activities one should know then that scholarship is not the qualification necessary to understand ka even the demigods and the great sages have tried to understand ka by their mental speculation and they have failed to do so in the rmadbhgavatam also it is clearly said that even the great demigods are not able to understand the supreme personality of godhead they can speculate to the limits of their imperfect senses and can reach the opposite conclusion of impersonalism of something not manifested by the three qualities of material nature or they can imagine something by mental speculation but it is not possible to understand ka by such foolish speculation here the lord indirectly says that if anyone wants to know the absolute truth here i am present as the supreme personality of godhead i am the supreme one should know this although one cannot understand the inconceivable lord who is personally present he nonetheless exists we can actually understand ka who is eternal full of bliss and knowledge simply by studying his words in bhagavadgt and rmadbhgavatam the conception of god as some ruling power or as the impersonal brahman can be reached by persons who are in the inferior energy of the lord but the personality of godhead cannot be conceived unless one is in the transcendental position because most men cannot understand ka in his actual situation out of his causeless mercy he descends to show favor to such speculators yet despite the supreme lords uncommon activities these speculators due to contamination in the material energy still think that the impersonal brahman is the supreme only the devotees who are fully surrendered unto the supreme lord can understand by the grace of the supreme personality that he is ka the devotees of the lord do not bother about the impersonal brahman conception of god their faith and devotion bring them to surrender immediately unto the supreme lord and out of the causeless mercy of ka they can understand ka no one else can understand him so even great sages agree what is tm what is the supreme it is he whom we have to copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all

millions and millions of ordinary men who have no knowledge of spiritual realization but out of those actually trying to understand their spiritual situation one who can come to the understanding that ka is the supreme personality of godhead the proprietor of everything the unborn is the most successful spiritually realized person in that stage only when one has fully understood copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved kas supreme position can one be free completely from all sinful reactions here the lord is described by the word aja meaning unborn but he is distinct from the living entities who are described in the second chapter as aja the lord is different from the living entities who are taking birth and dying due to material attachment the conditioned souls are changing their bodies but his body is not changeable even when he comes to this material world he comes as the same unborn therefore in the fourth chapter it is said that the lord by his internal potency is not under the inferior material energy but is always in the superior energy in this verse the words vetti lokamahevaram indicate that one should know that lord ka is the supreme proprietor of the planetary systems of the universe he was existing before the creation and he is different from his creation all the demigods were created within this material world but as far as ka is concerned it is said that he is not created therefore ka is different even from the great demigods like brahm and iva and because he is the creator of brahm iva and all the other demigods he is the supreme person of all planets r ka is therefore different from everything that is created and anyone who knows him as such immediately becomes liberated from all sinful reactions one must be liberated from all sinful activities to be in the knowledge of the supreme lord only by devotional service can he be known and not by any other means as stated in bhagavadgt one should not try to understand ka as a human being as stated previously only a foolish person thinks him to be a human being this is again expressed here in a different way a man who is not foolish who is intelligent enough to understand the constitutional position of the godhead is always free from all sinful reactions if ka is known as the son of devak then how can he be unborn that is also explained in rmadbhgavatam when he appeared before devak and vasudeva he was not born as an ordinary child he appeared in his original form and then he transformed himself into an ordinary child anything done under the direction of ka is transcendental it cannot be contaminated by material reactions which may be auspicious or inauspicious copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved the conception that there are things auspicious and inauspicious in the material world is more or less a mental concoction because there is nothing auspicious in the material world everything is inauspicious because the very material nature is inauspicious we simply imagine it to be auspicious real auspiciousness depends on activities in ka consciousness in full devotion and service therefore if we at all want our activities to be auspicious then we should work under the directions of the supreme lord such directions are given in authoritative scriptures such as rmadbhgavatam and bhagavadgt or from a bona fide spiritual master because the spiritual master is the representative of the supreme lord his direction is directly the direction of the supreme lord the spiritual master saintly persons and scriptures direct in the same way there is no contradiction in these three sources all actions done under such direction are free from the reactions of pious or impious activities of this material world the transcendental attitude of the devotee in the performance of activities is actually that of renunciation and this is called sannysa as stated in the first verse of the sixth chapter of bhagavadgt one who acts as a matter of duty because he has been ordered to do so by the supreme lord and who does not seek shelter in the fruits of his activities anrita karmaphalam is a true renouncer anyone acting under the direction of the supreme lord is actually a sannys and a yog and not the man who has simply taken the dress of the sannys or a pseudo yog texts 45 buijarnamasammaaeh amaa satya dma xama sau

no prohibition against meeting the proper needs of the senses but unnecessary sense enjoyment is detrimental for spiritual advancement therefore the senses should be restrained from unnecessary use similarly one should restrain the mind from unnecessary thoughts that is called ama one should not spend ones time pondering over earning money that is a misuse of the thinking power the mind should

development of ka consciousness should be accepted and anything copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved unfavorable should be rejected bhava birth should be understood to refer to the body as far as the soul is concerned there is neither birth nor death that we have discussed in the beginning of bhagavadgt birth and death apply to ones embodiment in the material world fear is due to worrying about the future a person in ka consciousness has no fear because by his activities he is sure to go back to the spiritual sky back home back to godhead therefore his future is very bright others however do not know what their future holds they have no knowledge of what the next life holds so they are therefore in constant anxiety if we want to get free from anxiety then the best course is to understand ka and be situated always in ka consciousness in that way we will be free from all fear in the rmadbhgavatam 11237 it is stated bhaya dvitybhiniveata syt fear is caused by our absorption in the illusory energy but those who are free from the illusory energy those who are confident that they are not the material body that they are spiritual parts of the supreme personality of godhead and who are therefore engaged in the transcendental service of the supreme godhead have nothing to fear their future is very bright this fear is a condition of persons who are not in ka consciousness abhayam fearlessness is possible only for one in ka consciousness ahis nonviolence means that one should not do anything which will put others into misery or confusion material activities that are promised by so many politicians sociologists philanthropists etc do not produce very good results because the politicians and philanthropists have no transcendental vision they do not know what is actually beneficial for human society ahis means that people should be trained in such a way that the full utilization of the human body can be achieved the human body is meant for spiritual realization so any movement or any commissions which do not further that end commit violence on the human body that which furthers the future spiritual happiness of the people in general is called nonviolence samat equanimity refers to freedom from attachment and aversion to be very much attached or to be very much detached is not the best this material world should be accepted without attachment or aversion that which is copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved favorable for prosecuting ka consciousness should be accepted that which is unfavorable should be rejected that is called samat equanimity a person in ka consciousness has nothing to reject and nothing to accept save in terms of its usefulness in the prosecution of ka consciousness tui satisfaction means that one should not be eager to gather more and more material goods by unnecessary activity one should be satisfied with whatever is obtained by the grace of the supreme lord that is called satisfaction tapas means austerity or penance there are many rules and regulations in the vedas which apply here like rising early in the morning and taking a bath sometimes it is very troublesome to rise early in the morning but whatever voluntary trouble one may suffer in this way is called penance similarly there are prescriptions for fasting on certain days of the month one may not be inclined to practice such fasting but because of his determination to make advancement in the science of ka consciousness he should accept such bodily troubles when they are recommended however one should not fast unnecessarily or against vedic injunctions one should not fast for some political purpose that is described in bhagavadgt as fasting in ignorance and anything done in ignorance or passion does not lead to spiritual advancement everything done in the mode of goodness does advance one however and fasting done in terms of the vedic injunctions enriches one in spiritual knowledge as far as charity is concerned one should give fifty percent of his earnings to some good cause and what is a good cause it is that which is conducted in terms of ka consciousness that is not only a good cause but the best cause because ka is good his cause is also good thus charity should be given to a person who is engaged in ka consciousness according to vedic literature it is enjoined that charity should be given to the brhmaas this practice is still followed although not very nicely in terms of the vedic injunction but still the injunction is that charity should be given to the brhmaas why because they are engaged in higher cultivation of spiritual knowledge a brhmaa is supposed to devote his whole life to understanding brahman brahma jntti brhmaa one who knows brahman is called a brhmaa thus charity is offered to the brhmaas because they are always engaged in copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved higher spiritual service and have no time to earn their livelihood in the vedic literature charity is also to be awarded to one in the renounced order of life the sannys the sannyss beg from door to door not for money but for missionary purposes the system is that they go from door to door to awaken the householders from the slumber of ignorance because the householders are engaged in family affairs and have forgotten their actual purpose in lifeawakening their ka consciousnessit is the business of the sannyss to go as beggars to the householders and encourage them to be ka conscious as it is said in the vedas one should awake and achieve what is due him in this human form of life this knowledge and method is distributed by the sannyss hence charity is to be given to the renouncer of life to the brhmaas and similar good causes not to any whimsical cause yaas fame should be according to lord caitanya who said that a man is famous when he is known as a great devotee that is real fame if one has become a great man in ka consciousness and it is known then he is truly famous one who does not have such fame is infamous all these qualities are manifest throughout the universe in human society and in the society of the demigods there are many forms of humanity on other planets and these qualities are there now for one who wants to advance in ka consciousness ka creates all these qualities but the person develops them himself from within one who engages in the devotional service of the supreme lord develops all the good qualities as arranged by the supreme lord of whatever we find good or bad the origin is ka nothing can manifest itself in this material world which is not in ka that is knowledge although we know that things are differently situated we should realize that everything flows from ka text 6 mahzrya sa

transcendental subjects the symptoms of the pure devotees are described in this verse specifically devotees of the supreme lord are twentyfour hours daily engaged in glorifying the qualities and pastimes of the supreme lord their hearts and souls are constantly submerged in ka and they take pleasure in discussing him with other devotees in the preliminary stage of devotional service they relish the copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved transcendental pleasure from the service itself and in the mature stage they are actually situated in love of god once situated in that transcendental position they can relish the highest perfection which is exhibited by the lord in his abode lord caitanya likens transcendental devotional service to the sowing of a seed in the heart of the living entity there are innumerable living entities traveling throughout the different planets of the universe and out of them there are a few who are fortunate enough to meet a pure devotee and get the chance to understand devotional service this devotional service is just like a seed and if it is sown in the heart of a living entity and if he goes on hearing and chanting hare ka hare ka ka ka hare hare hare rma hare rma rma rma hare hare that seed fructifies just as the seed of a tree fructifies with regular watering the spiritual plant of devotional service gradually grows and grows until it penetrates the covering of the material universe and enters into the brahmajyoti effulgence in the spiritual sky in the spiritual sky also that plant grows more and more until it reaches the highest planet which is called goloka vndvana the supreme planet of ka ultimately the plant takes shelter under the lotus feet of ka and rests there gradually as a plant grows fruits and flowers that plant of devotional service also produces fruits and the watering process in the form of chanting and hearing goes on this plant of devotional service is fully described in the caitanyacaritmta madhyall chapter nineteen it is explained there that when the complete plant takes shelter under the lotus feet of the supreme lord one becomes fully absorbed in love of god then he cannot live even for a moment without being in contact with the supreme lord just as a fish cannot live without water in such a state the devotee actually attains the transcendental qualities in contact with the supreme lord the rmadbhgavatam is also full of such narrations about the relationship between the supreme lord and his devotees therefore the rmadbhgavatam is very dear to the devotees as stated in the bhgavatam itself 121318 rmadbhgavata puram amala yad vaiavn priyam in this narration there is nothing about material activities economic development sense gratification or liberation rmadbhgavatam is the only narration in which the transcendental nature of the supreme lord and his copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved devotees is fully

chapter the lord instructing arjuna said that he had spoken to him of many things and that he would instruct him in the way of buddhiyoga now buddhiyoga is explained buddhiyoga itself is action in ka consciousness that is the highest intelligence buddhi means intelligence and yoga means mystic activities or mystic elevation when one copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved tries to go back home back to godhead and takes fully to ka consciousness in devotional service his action is called buddhi yoga in other words buddhiyoga is the process by which one gets out of the entanglement of this material world the ultimate goal of progress is ka people do not know this therefore the association of devotees and a bona fide spiritual master are important one should know that the goal is ka and when the goal is assigned then the path is slowly but progressively traversed and the ultimate goal is achieved when a person knows the goal of life but is addicted to the fruits of activities he is acting in karmayoga when he knows that the goal is ka but he takes pleasure in mental speculations to understand ka he is acting in jnayoga and when he knows the goal and seeks ka completely in ka consciousness and devotional service he is acting in bhaktiyoga or buddhiyoga which is the complete yoga this complete yoga is the highest perfectional stage of life a person may have a bona fide spiritual master and may be attached to a spiritual organization but still if he is not intelligent enough to make progress then ka from within gives him instructions so that he may ultimately come to him without difficulty the qualification is that a person always engage himself in ka consciousness and with love and devotion render all kinds of services he should perform some sort of work for ka and that work should be with love if a devotee is not intelligent enough to make progress on the path of selfrealization but is sincere and devoted to the activities of

sometimes philosophers criticize the devotees because they think that most of the devotees are in the darkness of ignorance and are philosophically naive sentimentalists actually that is not the fact there are very very learned scholars who have put forward the philosophy of devotion but even if a devotee does not take advantage of their literatures or of his spiritual master if he is sincere in his devotional service he is helped by ka himself within his heart so the sincere devotee engaged in ka consciousness cannot be without knowledge the only qualification is that one carry out devotional service in full ka consciousness the modern philosophers think that without discriminating one cannot have pure knowledge for them this answer is given by the supreme lord those who are engaged in pure devotional service even though they be copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved without sufficient education and even without sufficient knowledge of the vedic principles are still helped by the supreme god as stated in this verse the lord tells arjuna that basically there is no possibility of understanding the supreme truth the absolute truth the supreme personality of godhead simply by speculating for the supreme truth is so great that it is not possible to understand him or to achieve him simply by making a mental effort man can go on speculating for several millions of years and if he is not devoted if he is not a lover of the supreme truth he will never understand ka or the supreme truth only by devotional service is the supreme truth ka pleased and by his inconceivable energy he can reveal himself to the heart of the pure devotee the pure devotee always has ka within his heart and with the presence of ka who is just like the sun the darkness of ignorance is at once dissipated this is the special mercy rendered to the pure devotee by ka due to the contamination of material association through many many millions of births ones heart is always covered with the dust of materialism but when one engages in devotional service and constantly chants hare ka the dust quickly clears and one is elevated to the platform of pure knowledge the ultimate goal viu can be attained only by this chant and by devotional service and not by mental speculation or argument the pure devotee does not have to worry about the material necessities of life he need not be anxious because when he removes the darkness from his heart everything is provided automatically by the supreme lord who is pleased by the loving devotional service of the devotee this is the essence of the teachings of bhagavadgt by studying bhagavadgt one can become a soul completely surrendered to the supreme lord and engage himself in pure devotional service

chance to the modern philosopher for here it is clear that the supreme is different from the individual soul arjuna after hearing the essential four verses of bhagavadgt bg 10811 in this chapter became completely free from all doubts and accepted ka as the supreme personality of godhead he at once boldly declares you are para brahma the supreme personality of godhead and previously ka stated that he is the originator of everything and everyone every demigod and every human being is dependent on him men and demigods out of ignorance think that they are absolute and independent of the supreme personality of godhead that ignorance is removed perfectly by the discharge of devotional service this has already been explained in the previous verse by the lord now by his grace arjuna is accepting him as the supreme truth in concordance with the vedic injunction it is not that because ka is arjunas intimate friend arjuna is flattering him by calling him the supreme personality of godhead the absolute truth whatever arjuna says in these two verses is confirmed by vedic truth vedic injunctions affirm that only one who takes to devotional service to the supreme lord can understand him whereas others cannot each and every word of this verse spoken by arjuna is confirmed by vedic injunction in the kena upaniad it is stated that the supreme brahman is the rest for everything and ka has already explained that everything is resting on him the muaka upaniad confirms that the supreme lord in whom everything is resting can be realized only by those who engage constantly in thinking of him this constant thinking of ka is smaraam one of the methods of devotional service it is only by devotional service to ka that one can understand his position and get rid of this material body in the vedas the supreme lord is accepted as the purest of the pure one who understands that ka is the purest of the pure can become purified from all sinful activities one cannot be disinfected from sinful activities unless he surrenders unto the supreme lord arjunas acceptance of ka as the supreme pure complies with the injunctions of vedic literature this is also copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved confirmed by great personalities of whom nrada is the chief ka is the supreme personality of godhead and one should always meditate upon him and enjoy ones transcendental relationship with him he is the supreme existence he is free from bodily needs birth and death not only does arjuna confirm this but all the vedic literatures the puras and histories in all vedic literatures ka is thus described and the supreme lord himself also says in the fourth chapter although i am unborn i appear on this earth to establish religious principles he is the supreme origin he has no cause for he is the cause of all causes and everything is emanating from him this perfect knowledge can be had by the grace of the supreme lord here arjuna expresses himself through the grace of ka if we want to understand bhagavadgt we should accept the statements in these two verses this is called the parampar system acceptance of the disciplic succession unless one is in the disciplic succession he cannot understand bhagavadgt it is not possible by socalled academic education unfortunately those proud of their academic education despite so

understand ka he is not known even by the demigods so what to speak of the socalled scholars of this modern world by the grace of the supreme lord arjuna has understood that the supreme truth is ka and that he is the perfect one one should therefore follow the path of arjuna he received the authority of bhagavadgt as described in the fourth chapter the parampar system of disciplic succession for the understanding of bhagavadgt was lost and therefore ka reestablished that disciplic succession with arjuna because he considered arjuna his intimate friend and a great devotee therefore as stated in our introduction to gtopaniad bhagavadgt should be understood in the parampar system when the parampar system was lost arjuna was selected to rejuvenate it the acceptance by arjuna of all that ka says should be emulated then we can understand the essence of bhagavadgt and then only can we understand that ka is the supreme personality of godhead text 15 svyamaevatmanaatmaana vetqa tv pauzaetama

atheistic mentality cannot know ka mental speculation that leads one away from the supreme lord is a serious sin and one who does not know ka should not try to comment on bhagavadgt bhagavadgt is the statement of ka and since it is the science of ka it should be understood from ka as arjuna understood it it should not be received from atheistic persons as stated in rmadbhgavatam 1211 vadanti tat tattvavidas tattva yaj jnam advayam brahmeti paramtmeti bhagavn iti abdyate the supreme truth is realized in three aspects as impersonal brahman localized paramtm and at last as the supreme personality of godhead so at the last stage of understanding the absolute truth one comes to the supreme personality of godhead a common man or even a liberated man who has copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved realized impersonal brahman or localized paramtm may not understand gods personality such men therefore may endeavor to understand the supreme person from the verses of bhagavadgt which are being spoken by this person ka sometimes the impersonalists accept ka as bhagavn or they accept his authority yet many liberated persons cannot understand ka as puruottama the supreme person therefore arjuna addresses him as puruottama yet one still may not understand that ka is the father of all living entities therefore arjuna addresses him as bhtabhvana and if one comes to know him as the father of all the living entities still one may not know him as the supreme controller therefore he is addressed here as bhtea the supreme controller of everyone and even if one knows ka as the supreme controller of all living entities still one may not know that he is the origin of all the demigods therefore he is addressed herein as devadeva the worshipful god of all demigods and even if one knows him as the worshipful god of all demigods one may not know that he is the supreme proprietor of everything therefore he is addressed as jagatpati thus the

by the common man common men including the demons and atheists cannot know ka because he is guarded by his yogamy energy again these questions are asked by arjuna for their benefit the superior devotee is concerned not only for his own understanding but for the understanding of all mankind so arjuna out of his mercy because he is a vaiava a devotee is opening for the common man the understanding of the allpervasiveness of the supreme lord he addresses ka specifically as yogin because r ka is the master of the yogamy energy by which he is covered and uncovered to the common man the common man who has no love for ka cannot always think of ka therefore he has to think materially arjuna is considering the mode of thinking of the materialistic persons of this world the words keu keu ca bhveu refer to material nature the word bhva means physical things because materialists cannot understand ka spiritually they are advised to concentrate the mind on physical things and try to see how ka is manifested by physical representations text 18 copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved ivstareaatmanaae yaaega ivauita c janaadrna auya kqaya taiihr vtaae

is glorified by excellent prayers those who have entered into a transcendental relationship with ka relish at every copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved step the descriptions of the pastimes of the lord rmadbhgavatam 1119 thus arjuna is interested in hearing about ka and specifically how he remains as the allpervading supreme lord now as far as amtam nectar is concerned any narration or statement concerning ka is just like nectar and this nectar can be perceived by practical experience modern stories fiction and histories are different from the transcendental pastimes of the lord in that one will tire of hearing mundane stories but one never tires of hearing about ka it is for this reason only that the history of the whole universe is replete with references to the pastimes of the incarnations of godhead the puras are histories of bygone ages that relate the pastimes of the various incarnations of the lord in this way the reading matter remains forever fresh despite repeated readings text 19 qagavanauvac hnta tae kqaiyazyaaima idvyaa atmaivautaya paadaanyata kue naastyantaae ivstarsya mae 19 rbhagavn uvca hanta te kathayiymi

rights reserved translation the supreme personality of godhead said yes i will tell you of my splendorous manifestations but only of those which are prominent o arjuna for my opulence is limitless purport it is not possible to comprehend the greatness of ka and his opulences the senses of the individual soul are limited and do not permit him to understand the totality of kas affairs still the devotees try to understand ka but not on the principle that they will be able to understand ka fully at any specific time or in any state of life rather the very topics of ka are so relishable that they appear to the devotees as nectar thus the devotees enjoy them in discussing kas opulences and his diverse energies the pure devotees take transcendental pleasure therefore they want to hear and discuss them ka knows that living entities do not understand the extent of his opulences he therefore agrees to state only the principal manifestations of his different energies the word prdhnyata principal is very important because we can understand only a few of the principal details of the supreme lord for his features are unlimited it is not possible to understand them all and vibhti as used in this verse refers to the opulences by which he controls the whole manifestation in the amarakoa dictionary it is stated that vibhti indicates an exceptional opulence the impersonalist or pantheist cannot understand the exceptional opulences of the supreme lord nor the manifestations of his divine energies both in the material world and in the spiritual world his energies are distributed in every variety of manifestation now ka is describing what can be directly perceived by the common man thus part of his variegated energy is described in this way text 20 copyright 1998

as gukea which means one who has conquered the darkness of sleep for those who are sleeping in the darkness of ignorance it is not possible to understand how the supreme personality of godhead manifests himself in various ways in the material and spiritual worlds thus this address by ka to arjuna is significant because arjuna is above such darkness the personality of godhead agrees to describe his various opulences ka first informs arjuna that he is the soul of the entire cosmic manifestation by dint of his primary expansion before the material creation the supreme lord by his plenary expansion accepts the purua incarnations and from him everything begins therefore he is tm the soul of the mahattattva the universal elements the total material energy is not the cause copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved of the creation actually the mahviu enters into the mahattattva the total material energy he is the soul when mahviu enters into the manifested universes he again manifests himself as the supersoul in each and every entity we have experience that the personal body of the living entity exists due to the presence of the spiritual spark without the existence of the spiritual spark the body cannot develop similarly the material manifestation cannot develop unless the supreme soul ka enters as stated in the subala upaniad praktydisarvabhtntarym sarvae ca nryaa the supreme personality of godhead is existing as the supersoul in all manifested universes the three puruaavatras are described in rmadbhgavatam they are also

controlling deity marci represents ka among the stars the moon is the most prominent at night and thus the moon represents ka it appears from this verse that the moon is one of the stars therefore the stars that twinkle in the sky also reflect the light of the sun the theory that there are many suns within the universe is not accepted by vedic literature the sun is one and as by the reflection of the sun the moon illuminates so also do the stars since bhagavadgt indicates herein that the moon is one of the stars the twinkling stars are not suns but are similar to the moon text 22 vedanaa

and meter are not written whimsically as in much modern poetry amongst the regulated poetry the gyatr mantra which is chanted by the duly qualified brhmaas is the most prominent the gyatr mantra is mentioned in the rmadbhgavatam because the gyatr mantra is especially meant for god realization it represents the supreme lord this mantra is meant for spiritually advanced people and when one attains success in chanting it he can enter into the transcendental position of the lord one must first acquire the qualities of the perfectly situated person the qualities of goodness according to the laws of material nature in order to chant the gyatr mantra the gyatr mantra is very important in vedic civilization and is considered to be the sound incarnation of brahman brahm is its initiator and it is passed down from him in disciplic succession the month of novemberdecember is considered the best of all months because in india grains are collected from the fields at this time and the people become

translation but what need is there arjuna for all this detailed knowledge with a single fragment of myself i pervade and support this entire universe purport the supreme lord is represented throughout the entire material universes by his entering into all things as the supersoul the lord here tells arjuna that there is no point in understanding how things exist in their separate opulence and grandeur he should know that all things are existing due to kas entering them as supersoul from brahm the most gigantic entity on down to the smallest ant all are existing because the lord has entered each and all and is sustaining them there is a mission that regularly propounds that worship of any demigod will lead one to the supreme personality of godhead or the supreme goal but worship of demigods is thoroughly discouraged herein because even the copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved greatest demigods like brahm and iva represent only part of the opulence of the supreme lord he is the origin of everyone born and no one is greater than him he is asamaurdhva which means that no one is superior to him and that no one is equal to him in the padma pura it is said that one who considers the supreme lord ka in the same category with demigodsbe they even brahm or ivabecomes at once an atheist if however one thoroughly studies the different descriptions of the opulences and expansions of kas energy then one can understand without any doubt the position of lord r ka and can fix his mind in the worship of ka without deviation the lord is allpervading by the expansion of his partial representation the supersoul who enters into everything that is pure devotees therefore concentrate their minds in ka consciousness in full devotional service therefore they are always situated in the transcendental position devotional service and worship of ka are very clearly indicated in this chapter in verses eight through eleven that is the way of pure devotional service how one can attain the highest devotional perfection of association with the supreme personality of godhead has been thoroughly explained in this chapter rla baladeva vidybhaa a great crya in disciplic succession from ka concludes his commentary on this chapter by saying yacchaktilet surydy bhavanty atyugratejasa yadaena dhta viva sa ko daame rcyate from lord kas potent energy even the powerful sun gets its power and by kas partial expansion the whole world is maintained therefore lord r ka is worshipable thus end the bhaktivedanta purports to the tenth chapter of

1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved this chapter reveals ka as the cause of all causes he is even the cause of the mahviu from whom the material universes emanate ka is not an incarnation he is the source of all incarnations that has been completely explained in the last chapter now as far as arjuna is concerned he says that his illusion is over this means that arjuna no longer thinks of ka as a mere human being as a friend of his but as the source of everything arjuna is very enlightened and is glad that he has such a great friend as ka but now he is thinking that although he may accept ka as the source of everything others may not so in order to establish kas divinity for all he is requesting ka in this chapter to show his universal form actually when one sees the universal form of ka one becomes frightened like arjuna but ka is so kind that after showing it he converts himself again into his original form arjuna agrees to what ka has several times said ka is speaking to him just for his benefit so arjuna acknowledges that all this is happening to him by kas grace he is now convinced that ka is the cause of all causes and is present in everyones heart

personalities o supreme form though i see you here before me in your actual position as you have described yourself i wish to see how you have entered into this cosmic manifestation i want to see that form of yours purport the lord said that because he entered into the material universe by his personal representation the cosmic manifestation has been made possible and is going on now as far as arjuna is concerned he is inspired by the statements of ka but in order to convince others in the future who may think that ka is an ordinary person arjuna desires to see him actually in his universal form to see how he is acting from within the universe although he is apart from it arjunas addressing the lord as puruottama is also significant since the lord is the supreme personality of godhead he is present within arjuna himself therefore he knows the desire of arjuna and he can understand that arjuna has no special desire to see him in his universal form for arjuna is completely satisfied to see him in his personal form of ka but the lord can understand also that arjuna wants to see the universal form to convince others arjuna did not have any personal desire for confirmation ka also understands that arjuna wants to see the universal form to set a criterion for in the future there would be so many imposters who would pose themselves as incarnations of god the people therefore should be careful one who claims to be ka should be prepared to show his universal form to confirm his claim to the people text 4 copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved

perceive the supreme lord ka by the material senses but if one is engaged in loving transcendental service to the lord from the beginning then one can see the lord by revelation every living entity is only a spiritual spark therefore it is not possible to see or to understand the supreme lord arjuna as a devotee does not depend on his speculative strength rather he admits his limitations as a living entity and acknowledges kas inestimable position arjuna could understand that for a living entity it is not possible to understand the unlimited infinite if the infinite reveals himself then it is possible to understand the nature of the infinite by the grace of the infinite the word yogevara is also very significant here because the lord has inconceivable power if he likes he can reveal himself by his grace although he is copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved unlimited therefore arjuna pleads for the inconceivable grace of ka he does not give ka orders ka is not obliged to reveal himself unless one surrenders fully in ka consciousness and engages in devotional service thus it is not possible for persons who depend on the strength of their mental

nonmanifested it is not eternally situated in the spiritual sky like kas other forms as far as a devotee is concerned he is not eager to see the universal form but because arjuna wanted to see ka in

see ka in any form except his form with two hands a devotee must see his universal form by his grace not with the mind but with spiritual eyes to see the universal form of ka arjuna is told not to change his mind but his vision the universal form of ka is not very important that will be clear in subsequent verses yet because arjuna wanted copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved to see it the lord gives him the particular vision required to see that universal form devotees who are correctly situated in a transcendental relationship with ka are attracted by loving features not by a godless display of opulences the playmates of ka the friends of ka and the parents of ka never want ka to show his opulences they are so immersed in pure love that they do not even know that ka is the supreme personality of godhead in their loving exchange they forget that ka is the supreme lord in the rmadbhgavatam it is stated that the boys who play with ka are all highly pious souls and after many many births they are able to play with ka such boys do not know that ka is the supreme personality of godhead they take him as a personal friend therefore ukadeva gosvm recites this verse ittha sat brahmasukhnubhty dsya gatn paradaivatena myritn naradrakea ska vijahru ktapuyapuj here is the supreme person who is considered the impersonal brahman by great sages the supreme personality of godhead by devotees and a product of material nature by ordinary men now these boys who have performed many many pious activities in their past lives are playing with that supreme personality of godhead rmadbhgavatam 101211 the fact is that the devotee is not concerned with seeing the vivarpa the universal form but arjuna wanted to see it to substantiate kas statements so that in the future people could understand that ka not only theoretically or philosophically presented himself as the supreme but actually presented himself as such to arjuna arjuna must confirm this because arjuna is the beginning of the parampar system those who are actually interested in understanding the supreme personality of godhead ka and who follow in the footsteps of arjuna should understand that ka not only theoretically presented himself as the supreme but actually revealed himself as the supreme the lord gave arjuna the necessary power to see his universal form copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved because he knew that arjuna did not particularly want to see it as we have already explained text 9 saya ovac wvmaua tataae

scriptures there are many universes and many planets some of them are made of earth some are made of gold some are made of jewels some are very great some are not so great etc sitting on his chariot

revealed the relationship between ka and arjuna changes immediately before ka and arjuna had a relationship based on friendship but here after the revelation arjuna is offering obeisances with great respect and with folded hands he is praying to ka he is praising the universal form thus arjunas relationship becomes one of wonder rather than friendship great devotees see ka as the reservoir of all relationships in the scriptures there are twelve basic kinds of relationships copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved mentioned and all of them are present in ka it is said that he is the ocean of all the relationships exchanged between two living entities between the gods or between the supreme lord and his devotees here arjuna was inspired by the relationship of wonder and in that wonder although he was by nature very sober calm and quiet he became ecstatic his hair stood up and he began to offer his obeisances unto the supreme lord with folded hands he was not of course afraid he was affected by the wonders of the supreme lord the immediate context is wonder his natural loving friendship was overwhelmed by wonder and thus he reacted in this way text 15

asked further about the actual mission of this devastating force it is written in the vedas that the supreme truth destroys everything even the brhmaas as stated in the kaha upaniad 1225 yasya brahma

the alldevouring giant and here ka presents himself in that form of alldevouring time except for a few pavas everyone who was present on that battlefield would be devoured by him arjuna was not in favor of the fight and he thought it was better not to fight then there would be no frustration in reply the lord is copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved saying that even if he did not fight every one of them would be destroyed for that was his plan if arjuna stopped fighting they would die in another way death could not be checked even if he did not fight in fact

significant the whole world is moving according to the plan of the supreme personality of godhead foolish persons who do not have sufficient knowledge think that nature is moving without a plan and all manifestations are but accidental formations there are many socalled scientists who suggest that perhaps it was like this or maybe like that but there is no question of perhaps and maybe there is a specific plan being carried out in this material world what is this plan this cosmic manifestation is a chance for the conditioned souls to go back to godhead back to home as long as they have the domineering mentality which makes them try to lord it over material nature they are conditioned but anyone who can understand the plan of the supreme lord and cultivate ka consciousness is most intelligent the creation and destruction of the cosmic manifestation are under the superior guidance of god thus the battle of kuruketra was fought according to the plan of god arjuna was refusing to fight but he was told that he should fight in accordance with the desire of the supreme lord then he would be happy if one is in full ka consciousness and his life is devoted to the lords

the outcome of the battle of kuruketra became enlightened and as a great devotee and friend of the supreme personality of godhead he said that everything done by ka is quite fit arjuna confirmed that ka is the maintainer and the object of worship for the devotees and the destroyer of the undesirables his actions are equally good for all arjuna understood herein that when the battle of kuruketra was being concluded in outer space there were present many demigods siddhas and the intelligentsia of the higher planets and they were observing the fight because ka was present there when arjuna saw the universal form of the lord the demigods took pleasure in it but others who were demons and atheists could not stand it when the lord was praised out of their natural fear of the devastating form

and copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved unlimited ananta indicates that there is nothing which is not covered by the influence and energy of the supreme lord and devea means that he is the controller of all demigods and is above them all he is the shelter of the whole universe arjuna also thought that it was fitting that all the perfect living entities and powerful demigods offer their respectful obeisances unto him because no one is greater than him arjuna especially mentions that ka is greater than brahm because brahm is created by him brahm is born out of the lotus stem grown from the navel abdomen of garbhodakay viu who is kas plenary expansion therefore brahm and lord iva who is born of brahm and all other demigods must offer their respectful obeisances it is stated in rmadbhgavatam that the lord is respected by lord iva and brahm and similar other demigods the word akaram is very significant because this material creation is subject to destruction

may have dishonored ka by addressing him o my friend o ka o ydava etc without acknowledging his opulence but ka is so kind and merciful that in spite of such opulence he played with arjuna as a friend such is the transcendental loving reciprocation between the devotee and the lord the relationship between the living entity and ka is fixed eternally it cannot be forgotten as we can see from the

anyone be one with you how then could there be anyone greater than you within the three worlds o lord of immeasurable power purport the supreme personality of godhead ka is worshipable as a father is worshipable for his son he is the spiritual master because he originally gave the vedic instructions to brahm and presently he is also instructing bhagavadgt to arjuna therefore he is the original spiritual master and any bona fide spiritual master at the present moment must be a descendant in the line of disciplic succession stemming from ka without being a representative of ka one cannot become a teacher or spiritual master of transcendental subject matter the lord is being paid obeisances in all respects he is of immeasurable greatness no one can be greater than the supreme personality of godhead ka because no one is equal to or higher than ka within any manifestation spiritual or material everyone is below him no one can excel him this is stated in the vetvatara upaniad 68 na tasya krya karaa ca vidyate na tatsama cbhyadhika ca dyate the supreme lord ka has senses and a body like the ordinary man but for him there is no difference between his senses his body his mind and himself foolish persons who do not perfectly know him say that ka is different from his soul mind heart and everything else ka is absolute therefore his activities and potencies are supreme it is also stated that copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved although he does not have senses like ours he can perform all sensory activities therefore his senses are neither imperfect nor limited no one can be greater than him no one can be equal to him and everyone is lower than him the knowledge strength and activities of the supreme personality are all transcendental

because he is a very dear friend and as a dear friend is gladdened by his friends opulence arjuna is very joyful to see that his friend ka is the supreme personality of godhead and can show such a wonderful universal form but at the same time after seeing that universal form he is afraid that he has committed so many offenses to ka out of his unalloyed friendship thus his mind is disturbed out of fear although he had no reason to fear arjuna therefore is asking ka to show his nryaa form because he can assume any form this universal form is material and temporary as the material world is temporary but in the vaikuha planets he has his transcendental form with four hands as nryaa there are innumerable planets in the spiritual sky and in each of them ka is present by his plenary

mercy upon his devotee arjuna showed his universal form full of effulgence and opulence this form was glaring like the sun and its many faces were rapidly changing ka showed this form just to satisfy the desire of his friend arjuna this form was manifested by ka through his internal potency which is inconceivable by human speculation no one had seen this universal form of the lord before arjuna but because the form was shown to arjuna other devotees in the heavenly planets and in other planets in outer space could also see it they had not seen it before but because of arjuna they were also able to see it in other words all the disciplic devotees of the lord could see the universal form which was shown to arjuna by the mercy of ka someone has commented that this form was shown to duryodhana also when ka went to duryodhana to negotiate for peace unfortunately duryodhana did not accept the peace offer but at that time ka manifested some of his universal forms but those forms are

world purport the divine vision in this connection should be clearly understood who can have divine vision divine means godly unless one attains the status of divinity as a demigod he cannot have divine vision and what is a demigod it is stated in the vedic scriptures that those who are devotees of lord viu are demigods viubhakt smt dev those who are atheistic ie who do not believe in viu or who recognize only the impersonal part of ka as the supreme cannot have the divine vision it is not possible to decry ka and at the same time have the divine vision one cannot have the divine vision without becoming divine in other words those who have divine vision can also see like arjuna the bhagavadgt gives the description of the universal form although this description was unknown to everyone before arjuna now one can have some idea of the vivarpa after this incident those who are actually divine can see the universal form of the lord but one cannot be divine without being a pure devotee of ka the devotees however who are actually in the divine nature and who have divine vision are not very much interested in seeing the universal form of the lord as described in the previous verse arjuna desired to see the fourhanded form of lord ka as viu and he copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved was actually afraid of the universal form in this verse there are some significant words just like vedayajdhyayanai which refers to studying vedic literature and the subject matter of sacrificial regulations veda refers to all kinds of vedic literature such as the four vedas g yajur sma and atharva and the eighteen puras the upaniads and the vedntastra one can study these at home or anywhere else similarly there are straskalpastras and mmsstrasfor studying the method of sacrifice dnai refers to charity which is offered to a suitable party such as those who are engaged in the transcendental loving service of the lordthe brhmaas and the vaiavas similarly pious activities refers to the agnihotra and the prescribed duties of the different castes and the voluntary acceptance of some bodily pains is called tapasya so one can perform all thesecan accept bodily penances give charity study the vedas etcbut unless he is a devotee like arjuna it is not possible to see that universal form those who are impersonalists are also imagining that they are seeing the universal form of the lord but from bhagavadgt we understand that the impersonalists are not devotees therefore they are unable to see the universal form of the lord there are many persons who create incarnations they falsely claim an ordinary human to be an incarnation but this is all foolishness we should follow the principles of bhagavadgt otherwise there is no possibility of attaining perfect spiritual knowledge although bhagavadgt is considered the preliminary study of the science of god still it is so perfect that it enables one to distinguish what is what the followers of a pseudo incarnation may say that they have also seen the transcendental incarnation of god the universal form but that is unacceptable because it is clearly stated here that unless one becomes a devotee of ka one cannot see the universal form of god so one first of all has to become a pure devotee of ka then he can claim that he can show the universal form of what he has seen a devotee of ka cannot accept false incarnations or followers of false incarnations text 49 copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved maa tae vyaqaa maa c ivmauaavae da pa

and master but ka said that he need not be afraid of killing his grandfather when the sons of dhtarra tried to disrobe draupad in the assembly of the kurus bhma and droa were silent and for such negligence of duty they should be killed ka showed his universal form to arjuna just to show him that these people were already killed for their unlawful action that scene was shown to arjuna because devotees are always peaceful and they cannot perform such horrible actions the purpose of the revelation of the universal form was shown now arjuna wanted to see the fourarmed form and ka showed him a devotee copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved is not much interested in the universal form for it does not enable one to reciprocate loving feelings either a devotee

bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved appeared as fourarmed nryaa but when he was requested by his parents he transformed himself into an ordinary child in appearance similarly ka knew that arjuna was not interested in seeing a fourhanded form but since arjuna asked to see this fourhanded form ka also showed him this form again and then showed himself in his twohanded form the word saumyavapu is very significant saumyavapu is a very beautiful form it is known as the most beautiful form when he was present everyone was attracted simply by kas form and because ka is the director of the universe he just banished the fear of arjuna his devotee and showed him again his beautiful form of ka in the brahmasahit 538 it is stated premjanacchuritabhaktivilocanena only a person whose

the supreme personality of godhead to be originally twohanded those who deride ka as if he were an ordinary person are shown here to be ignorant of his divine nature if ka is like an ordinary human being then how is it possible for him to show the universal form and again to show the fourhanded nryaa form so it is very clearly stated in bhagavadgt that one who thinks that ka is an ordinary person and who misguides the reader by claiming that it is the impersonal brahman within ka speaking is doing the greatest injustice ka has actually shown his universal form and his fourhanded viu form so how can he be an ordinary human being a pure devotee is not confused by misguiding commentaries on bhagavadgt because he knows what is what the original verses of bhagavadgt are as clear as

in the fortyeighth verse of this chapter lord ka concluded revealing his universal form and informed arjuna that this form is not possible to be seen by so many pious activities sacrifices etc now here the word sudurdaram is used indicating that kas twohanded form is still more confidential one may be able to see the universal form of ka by adding a little tinge of devotional service to various activities like penances vedic study and philosophical speculation it may be possible but without a tinge of bhakti one cannot see that has already been explained still beyond that universal form the form of ka with two hands is still more difficult to see even for demigods like brahm and lord iva they desire to see him and we have evidence in the rmadbhgavatam that when he was supposed to be in the womb of his mother devak all the demigods from heaven came to see the marvel of ka and they offered nice prayers to the lord although he was not at that time visible to them they waited to see him a foolish person may deride him thinking him an ordinary person and may offer respect not to him but to the impersonal something within him but these are all nonsensical postures ka in his twoarmed form is actually desired to be copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved seen by demigods like brahm and iva in bhagavadgt 911 it is also confirmed avajnanti m mh mnu tanum rita he is not visible to the foolish persons who deride him kas body as confirmed by brahmasahit and confirmed by ka himself in bhagavadgt is completely spiritual and full of bliss and eternality his body is never like a material body but for some who make a study of ka by reading bhagavadgt or similar vedic scriptures ka is a problem for one using a material process ka is considered to be a great historical personality and very learned philosopher but he is an ordinary man and even though he was so powerful he had to accept a material body ultimately they think that the absolute truth is impersonal therefore they think that from his impersonal feature he assumed a personal feature attached to material nature this is a materialistic calculation of the supreme lord another calculation is speculative those who are in search of knowledge also speculate on ka and consider him to be less important than the universal form of the supreme thus some think that the universal form of ka which was manifested to arjuna is more important than his personal form according to them the personal form of the supreme is something imaginary they believe that in the ultimate issue the absolute truth is not a person but the transcendental process is described in bhagavadgt chapter four to hear about ka from authorities that is the actual vedic process and those who are actually in the vedic line hear about ka from authority and by repeated hearing about him ka becomes dear as we have several times discussed ka is covered by his yogamy potency he is not to be seen or revealed to anyone and everyone only by one to whom he reveals himself can he be seen this is confirmed in vedic literature for one who is a surrendered soul the absolute truth can actually be understood the transcendentalist by continuous ka consciousness and by devotional service to ka can have his spiritual eyes opened and can see ka by revelation such a revelation is not possible even for the demigods therefore it is difficult even for the demigods to understand ka and the advanced demigods are always in hope of seeing ka in his twohanded form the conclusion is that although to see the universal form of ka is very very difficult and not possible for anyone and everyone it is still copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved more difficult to understand his personal form as ymasundara text 53 naah vedenar tapasaa na danaena na cejyayaa xakya wvivdaae du dvanaisa maa yaqaa 53 nha vedair na tapas na dnena na cejyay akya evavidho drau davn asi m yath synonyms

is very difficult to understand for those who are atheists or who are devoid of devotional service for scholars who have simply studied vedic literature by way of grammatical knowledge or mere academic qualifications ka is not possible to understand nor is he to be understood by persons who officially go to the temple to offer worship they make their copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved visit but they cannot understand ka as he is ka can be understood only through the path of devotional service as explained by ka himself in the next verse text 54 aya

can you enter into the mysteries of my understanding purport ka can be understood only by the process of undivided devotional service he explicitly explains this in this verse so that unauthorized commentators who try to understand bhagavadgt by the speculative process will know that they are simply wasting their time no one can understand copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved ka or how he came from parents in a fourhanded form and at once changed himself into a twohanded form these things are very difficult to understand by study of the vedas or by philosophical speculation therefore it is clearly stated here that no one can see him or enter into understanding of these matters those who however are very experienced students of vedic literature can learn about him from the vedic literature in so many ways there are so many rules and regulations and if one at all wants to understand ka he must follow the regulative principles described in the authoritative literature one can perform penance in accordance with those principles for example to undergo serious penances one may observe fasting on janmam the day on which ka appeared and on the two days of ekda the eleventh day after the new moon and the eleventh day after the full moon as far as charity is concerned it is plain that charity should be given to the devotees of ka who are engaged in his devotional service to spread the ka philosophy or ka consciousness throughout the world ka consciousness is a benediction to humanity lord caitanya was appreciated by rpa gosvm as the most munificent man of charity because love of ka which is very difficult to achieve was distributed freely by him so if one gives some amount of his money to persons involved in distributing ka consciousness that charity given to spread ka consciousness is the greatest charity in the world and if one worships as prescribed in the temple in the temples in india there is always some statue usually of viu or ka that is a chance to progress by offering worship and respect to the supreme personality of godhead for the beginners in devotional service to the lord temple worship is essential and this is confirmed in the vedic literature vetvatara upaniad 623 yasya deve par bhaktir yath deve tath gurau tasyaite kathit hy arth prakante mahtmana u 623881 one who has unflinching devotion for the supreme lord and is directed by copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved the spiritual master in whom he has similar unflinching faith can see the supreme personality of godhead by revelation one cannot understand ka by mental speculation for one who does not take personal training under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master it is impossible to even begin to understand ka the word tu is specifically used here to indicate that no other process can be used can be recommended or can be successful in understanding ka the personal forms of ka the twohanded form and the fourhanded are completely different from the temporary universal form shown to arjuna the fourhanded form of nryaa and the twohanded form of ka are eternal and transcendental whereas the universal form exhibited to arjuna is temporary the very word sudurdaram meaning difficult to see suggests that no one had seen that universal form it also suggests that amongst the devotees there was no necessity of showing it that form was exhibited by ka at the request of arjuna so that in the future when one represents himself as an incarnation of god people can ask to see his universal form the word na used repeatedly in the previous verse indicates that one should not be very much proud of such credentials as an academic education in vedic literature one must take to the devotional service of ka only then can one attempt to write commentaries on bhagavadgt ka changes from the universal form to the fourhanded form of nryaa and then to his own natural form of two hands this indicates that the fourhanded forms and other forms mentioned in vedic literature are all emanations of the original twohanded ka he is the origin of all emanations ka is distinct even from these forms what to speak of the impersonal conception as far as the fourhanded forms of ka are concerned it is stated clearly that even the most identical fourhanded form of ka which is known as mahviu who is lying on the cosmic ocean and from whose breathing so many innumerable universes are passing out and entering is also an expansion of the supreme lord as stated in the brahmasahit 548 yasyaikanivasitaklam athvalambya jvanti lomavilaj jagadaanth copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved viur mahn sa iha yasya kalvieo govindam dipurua tam aha bhajmi the mahviu into whom all the innumerable universes enter and from whom they come forth again simply by his breathing process is a plenary expansion of ka therefore i worship govinda ka the cause of all causes therefore one should conclusively worship the personal form of ka as the supreme personality of godhead who has eternal bliss and knowledge he is the source of all forms of viu he is the source of all forms of incarnation and he is the original supreme personality as confirmed in bhagavadgt in the vedic literature goplatpan upaniad 11 the following statement appears saccidnandarpya kykliakrie namo vedntavedyya gurave buddhiskie i offer my respectful obeisances unto ka who has a transcendental form of bliss eternity and knowledge i offer my respect to him because understanding him means understanding the vedas and he is therefore the supreme spiritual master then it is said ko vai parama daivatam ka is the supreme personality of godhead goplatpan upaniad 13 eko va sarvaga ka ya that one ka is the supreme personality of godhead and he is worshipable eko pi san bahudh yo vabhti ka is one but he is manifested in unlimited forms and expanded incarnations goplatpan upaniad 121 the brahmasahit 51 says vara parama ka saccidnandavigraha andir dir govinda sarvakraakraam the supreme personality of godhead is ka who has a body of eternity copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved knowledge and bliss he has no beginning for he is the beginning of everything he is the cause of all causes elsewhere it is said yatrvatra kkhya para brahma narkti the supreme absolute truth is a person his name is ka and he sometimes descends on this earth similarly in the rmadbhgavatam we find a description of all kinds of incarnations of the supreme personality of godhead and in this list the name of ka also appears but then it is said that this ka is not an incarnation of god but is the original supreme personality of godhead himself ete cakal pusa kas tu bhagavn svayam similarly in bhagavadgt the lord says matta paratara nnyat there is nothing superior to my form as the personality of godhead ka he also says elsewhere in bhagavadgt aham dir hi devnm i am the origin of all the demigods and after understanding bhagavadgt from ka arjuna also confirms this in the following words para brahma para dhma pavitramparama bhavn i now fully understand that you are the supreme personality of godhead the absolute truth and that you are the refuge of everything therefore the universal form which ka showed to arjuna is not the original form of god the original is the ka form the universal form with its thousands and thousands of heads and hands is manifest just to draw the attention of those who have no love for god it is not gods original form the universal form is not attractive for pure devotees who are in love with the lord in different transcendental relationships the supreme godhead exchanges transcendental love in his original form of ka therefore to arjuna who was so intimately related with ka in friendship this form of the universal manifestation was not pleasing rather it was fearful arjuna who was a constant companion of kas must have had transcendental eyes he was not an ordinary man therefore he was not captivated by the universal form this form may seem wonderful to persons who are involved in elevating themselves by fruitive activities but to persons who are engaged in devotional service the twohanded form of ka is the most dear copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved text 55

the supreme of all the personalities of godhead on the kaloka planet in the spiritual sky and be intimately connected with the supreme personality ka must take this formula as stated by the supreme himself therefore this verse is considered to be the essence of bhagavadgt the bhagavadgt is a book directed to the conditioned souls who are engaged in the material world with the purpose of copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved lording it over nature and who do not know of the real spiritual life the bhagavadgt is meant to show how one can understand his spiritual existence and his eternal relationship with the supreme spiritual personality and to teach one how to go back home back to godhead now here is the verse which clearly explains the process by which one can attain success in his spiritual activity devotional service as far as work is concerned one should transfer his energy entirely to ka conscious activities as stated in the bhaktirasmtasindhu 2255 ansaktasya viayn yathrham upayujata nirbandha kasambandhe yukta vairgyam ucyate no work should be done by any man except in relationship to ka this is called kakarma one may be engaged in various activities but one should not be attached to the result of his work the result should be done only for him for example one may be engaged in business but to transform that activity into ka consciousness one has to do business for ka if ka is the proprietor of the business then ka should enjoy the profit of the business if a businessman is in possession of thousands and thousands of dollars and if he has to offer all this to ka he can do it this is work for ka instead of constructing a big building for his sense gratification he can construct a nice temple for ka and he can install the deity of ka and arrange for the deitys service as is outlined in the authorized books of devotional service this is all kakarma one should not be attached to the result of his work but the result should be offered to ka and one should accept as prasdam the remnants of offerings to ka if one constructs a very big building for ka and installs the deity of ka one is not prohibited from living there but it is understood that the proprietor of the building is ka that is called ka consciousness if however one is not able to construct a temple for ka one can engage himself in cleansing the temple of ka that is also kakarma one can cultivate a garden anyone who has landin india at least any poor man has a certain amount of landcan copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved utilize that for ka by growing flowers to offer him one can sow tulas plants because tulas leaves are very important and ka has recommended this in bhagavadgt patra pupa phala toyam ka desires that one offer him either a leaf or a flower or fruit or a little waterand by such an offering he is satisfied this leaf especially refers to the tulas so one can sow tulas and pour water on the plant thus even the poorest man can engage in the service of ka these are some of the examples of how one can engage in working for ka the word matparama refers to one who considers the association of ka in his supreme abode to be the highest perfection of life such a person does not wish to be elevated to the higher planets such as the moon or sun or heavenly planets or even the highest planet of this universe brahmaloka he has no attraction for that he is only attracted to being transferred to the spiritual sky and even in the spiritual sky he is not satisfied with merging into the glowing brahmajyoti effulgence for he wants to enter the highest spiritual planet namely kaloka goloka vndvana he has full knowledge of that planet and therefore he is not interested in any other as indicated by the word madbhakta he fully engages in devotional service specifically in the nine processes of devotional engagement hearing chanting remembering worshiping serving the lotus feet of the lord offering prayers carrying out the orders of the lord making friends with him and surrendering everything to him one can engage in all nine devotional processes or eight or seven or at least in one and that will surely make one perfect the term sagavarjita is very significant one should disassociate himself from persons who are against ka not only are the atheistic persons against ka but so also are those who are attracted to fruitive activities and mental speculation therefore the pure form of devotional service is described in bhaktirasmtasindhu 1111 as follows anybhilitnya jnakarmdyanvtam nuklyena knulana bhaktir uttam madhya 19167 copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved in this verse rla rpa gosvm clearly states that if anyone wants to execute unalloyed devotional service he must be freed from all kinds of material contamination he must be freed from the association of persons who are addicted to fruitive activities and mental speculation when freed from such unwanted association and from the contamination of material desires one favorably cultivates knowledge of ka that is called pure devotional service nuklyasya sakalpa prtiklyasya varjanam haribhaktivilsa 11676 one should think of ka and act for ka favorably not unfavorably kasa was an enemy of kas from the very beginning of kas birth kasa planned in so many ways to kill him and because he was always unsuccessful he was always thinking of ka thus while working while eating and while sleeping he was always ka conscious in every respect but that ka consciousness was not favorable and therefore in spite of his always thinking of ka twentyfour hours a day he was considered a demon and ka at last killed him of course anyone who is killed by ka attains salvation immediately but that is not the aim of the pure devotee the pure devotee does not even want salvation he does not want to be transferred even to the highest planet goloka vndvana his only objective is to serve ka wherever he may be a devotee of ka is friendly to everyone therefore it is said here that he has no enemy nirvaira how is this a devotee situated in ka consciousness knows that only devotional service to ka can relieve a person from all the problems of life he has personal experience of this and therefore he wants to introduce this system ka consciousness into human society there are many examples in history of devotees of the lord who risked their lives for the spreading of god consciousness the favorite example is lord jesus christ he was crucified by the nondevotees but he sacrificed his life for spreading god consciousness of course it would be superficial to understand that he was killed similarly in india also there are many examples such as hkura haridsa and prahlda mahrja why such risk because they wanted to spread ka consciousness and it is difficult a ka conscious person knows that if a man is suffering it is due to his forgetfulness of his eternal relationship with ka therefore the highest benefit one can render copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved to human society is relieving ones neighbor from all material problems in such a way a pure devotee is engaged in the service of the lord now we can imagine how merciful ka is to those engaged in his service risking everything for him therefore it is certain that such persons must reach the supreme planet after leaving the body in summary the universal form of ka which is a temporary manifestation and the form of time which devours everything and even the form of viu fourhanded have all been exhibited by ka thus ka is the origin of all these manifestations it is not that ka is a manifestation of the original vivarpa or viu ka is the origin of all forms there are hundreds and thousands of vius but for a devotee no form of ka is important but the original form twohanded ymasundara in the brahmasahit it is stated that those who are attached to the ymasundara form of ka in love and devotion can see him always within the heart and cannot see anything else one should understand therefore that the purport of this eleventh chapter is that the form of ka is essential and supreme thus end the bhaktivedanta purports to the eleventh chapter of the rmad bhagavadgt in the matter of the universal form chapter 12 devotional service text 1 ajaurna ovac

are always properly engaged in your devotional service or those who worship the impersonal brahman the unmanifested purport ka has now explained about the personal the impersonal and the universal and has described all kinds of devotees and yogs generally the transcendentalists can be divided into two classes one is the impersonalist and the other is the personalist the personalist devotee engages himself with all energy in the service of the supreme lord the impersonalist also engages himself not directly in the service of ka but in meditation on the impersonal brahman the unmanifested we find in this chapter that of the different processes for realization of the absolute truth bhaktiyoga devotional service is the highest if one at all desires to have the association of the supreme personality of godhead then copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved he must take to devotional service those who worship the supreme lord directly by devotional service are called personalists those who engage themselves in meditation on the impersonal brahman are called impersonalists arjuna is here questioning which position is better there are different ways to realize the absolute truth but ka indicates in this chapter that bhaktiyoga or devotional service to him is the highest of all it is the most direct and it is the easiest means for association with the godhead in the second chapter of bhagavadgt the supreme lord explained that a living entity is not the material body he is a spiritual spark and the absolute truth is the spiritual whole in the seventh chapter he spoke of the living entity as being part and parcel of the supreme whole and recommended that he transfer his attention fully to the whole then again in the eighth chapter it was said that anyone who thinks of ka at the time of quitting his body is at once transferred to the spiritual sky to the abode of ka and at the end of the sixth chapter the lord clearly said that of all yogs one who always thinks of ka within himself is considered the most perfect so in practically every chapter the conclusion has been that one should be attached to the personal form of ka for that is the highest spiritual realization nevertheless there are those who are not attached to the personal form of ka they are so firmly detached that even in the preparation of commentaries to bhagavadgt they want to distract other people from ka and transfer all devotion to the impersonal brahmajyoti they prefer to meditate on the impersonal form of the absolute truth which is beyond the reach of the senses and is not manifest and so factually there are two classes of transcendentalists now arjuna is trying to settle the question of which process is easier and which of the classes is most perfect in other words he is clarifying his own position because he is attached to the personal form of ka he is not attached to the impersonal brahman he wants to know whether his position is secure the impersonal manifestation either in this material world or in the spiritual world of the supreme lord is a problem for meditation actually one cannot perfectly conceive of the impersonal feature of the absolute truth therefore arjuna copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved wants to say what is the use of such a waste of time arjuna experienced in the eleventh chapter that to be attached to the personal form of ka is best because he could thus understand all other forms at the same time and there was no disturbance to his love for ka this important question asked of ka by arjuna will clarify the distinction between the impersonal and personal conceptions of the absolute truth text 2 qagavanauvac mayyaavexya manaae yae maa inatyayaua opaasatae yaa

him with faith and devotion is to be considered most perfect in yoga for one in such ka consciousness there are no material activities because everything is done for ka a pure devotee is constantly

disheswhatever he does he does not let a single moment pass without devoting his activities to ka such action is in full samdhi texts 34 yae tvarmainaderxyamavya payaurpaasatae savragamaicntya c

after many births the man of wisdom seeks refuge in me knowing that vsudeva is all when a person comes to full knowledge after many births he surrenders unto lord ka if one approaches the godhead by the method mentioned in this verse he has to control the senses render service to everyone and engage in the welfare of all beings it is inferred that one has to approach lord ka otherwise there is no perfect realization often there is much penance involved before one fully surrenders unto him in order to perceive the supersoul within the individual soul one has to cease the sensual activities of seeing hearing tasting working etc then one comes to understand that the supreme soul is present everywhere realizing this one envies no living entityhe sees no difference between man and animal because he sees soul only not the outer covering but for the common man this method of impersonal realization is very difficult copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved

translation for those whose minds are attached to the unmanifested impersonal feature of the supreme advancement is very troublesome to make progress in that discipline is always difficult for those who are embodied purport the group of transcendentalists who follow the path of the inconceivable unmanifested impersonal feature of the supreme lord are called jnayogs and persons who are in full ka consciousness engaged in devotional service to the lord are called bhaktiyogs now here the difference between jnayoga and bhaktiyoga is definitely expressed the process of jnayoga although ultimately bringing one to the same goal is very troublesome whereas the path of bhaktiyoga the process of being in direct service to the copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved supreme personality of godhead is easier and is natural for the embodied soul the individual soul is embodied since time immemorial it is very difficult for him to simply theoretically understand that he is not the body therefore the bhaktiyog accepts the deity of ka as worshipable because there is some bodily conception fixed in the mind which can thus be applied of course worship of the supreme personality of godhead in his form within the temple is not idol worship there is evidence in the vedic literature that worship may be sagua and nirguaof the supreme possessing or not possessing attributes worship of the deity in the temple is sagua worship for the lord is represented by material qualities but the form of the lord though represented by material qualities such as stone wood or oil paint is not actually material that is the absolute nature of the supreme lord a crude example may be given here we may find some mailboxes on the street and if we post our letters in those boxes they will naturally go to their destination without difficulty but any old box or an imitation which we may find somewhere but which is not authorized by the post office will not do the work similarly god has an authorized representation in the deity form which is called arcvigraha this arcvigraha is an incarnation of the supreme lord god will accept service through that form the lord is omnipotent allpowerful therefore by his incarnation as arcvigraha he can accept the services of the devotee just to make it convenient for the man in conditioned life so for a devotee there is no difficulty in approaching the supreme immediately and directly but for those who are following the impersonal way to spiritual realization the path is difficult they have to understand the unmanifested representation of the supreme through such vedic literatures as the upaniads and they have to learn the language understand the nonperceptual feelings and realize all these processes this is not very easy for a common man a person in ka consciousness engaged in devotional service simply by the guidance of the bona fide spiritual master simply by offering regulative obeisances unto the deity simply by hearing the glories of the lord and simply by eating the remnants of foodstuffs offered to the lord realizes the supreme personality of godhead very easily there is no doubt copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved that the impersonalists are unnecessarily taking a troublesome path with the risk of not realizing the absolute truth at the ultimate end but the personalist without any risk trouble or difficulty approaches the supreme personality directly a similar passage appears in rmadbhgavatam it is stated there that if one ultimately has to surrender unto the supreme personality of godhead this surrendering process is called bhakti but instead takes the trouble to understand what is brahman and what is not brahman and spends his whole life in that way the result is simply troublesome therefore it is advised here that one should not take up this troublesome path of selfrealization because there is uncertainty in the ultimate result a living entity is eternally an individual soul and if he wants to merge into the spiritual whole he may accomplish the realization of the eternal and knowledgeable aspects of his original nature but the blissful portion is not realized by the grace of some devotee such a transcendentalist highly learned in the process of jnayoga may come to the point of bhaktiyoga or devotional service at that time long practice in impersonalism also becomes a source of trouble because he cannot give up the idea therefore an embodied soul is always in difficulty with the unmanifest both at the time of practice and at the time of realization every living soul is partially independent and one should know for certain that this unmanifested realization is against the nature of his spiritual blissful self one should not take up this process for every individual living entity the process of ka consciousness which entails full engagement in devotional service is the best way if one wants to ignore this devotional service there is the danger of turning to atheism thus the process of centering attention on the unmanifested the inconceivable which is beyond the approach of the senses as already expressed in this verse should never be encouraged at any time especially in this age it is not advised by lord ka texts 67 yae tau savaria kmaaria maiya sannyasya matpara ananyaenaev yaaegaena maa

him his duty is to render service to the lordand if he does not then he will render service to my as stated before the supreme lord can be appreciated only by devotional service therefore one should be fully devoted one should fix his mind fully on ka in order to achieve him one should work only for ka it does not matter in what kind of work one engages but that work should be done only for ka that is the standard of devotional service the devotee does not desire any achievement other than pleasing the supreme personality of godhead his lifes mission is to please ka and he can sacrifice everything for kas satisfaction just as arjuna did in the battle of kuruketra the process is very simple one can devote himself in his occupation and engage at the same time in chanting hare ka hare ka ka ka hare hare hare rma hare rma rma rma hare hare such transcendental chanting attracts the devotee to the personality of godhead the supreme lord herein promises that without delay he will deliver a pure devotee thus engaged from the ocean of material existence those who are advanced in yoga practice can willfully transfer the soul to whatever planet they like by the yoga process and others take the opportunity in various ways but as far as the devotee is concerned it is clearly stated here that the lord himself takes him the devotee does not need to wait to become very experienced in order to transfer himself to the spiritual sky in the varha pura this verse appears naymi parama sthnam arcirdigati vin garuaskandham ropya yatheccham anivrita the purport of this verse is that a devotee does not need to practice agayoga in order to transfer his soul to the spiritual planets the responsibility is taken by the supreme lord himself he clearly states here that he himself becomes the deliverer a child is completely cared for by his parents and thus his position is secure similarly a devotee does not need to copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved endeavor to transfer himself by yoga practice to other planets rather the supreme lord by his great mercy comes at once riding on his bird carrier garua and at once delivers the devotee from material existence although a man who has fallen in the ocean may struggle very hard and may be very expert in swimming he cannot save himself but if someone comes and picks him up from the water then he is easily rescued similarly the lord picks up the devotee from this material existence one simply has to practice the easy process of ka consciousness and fully engage himself in devotional service any intelligent man should always prefer the process of devotional service to all other paths in the nryaya this is confirmed as follows y vai sdhanasampatti pururthacatuaye tay vin tad pnoti naro nryaraya the purport of this verse is that one should not engage in the different processes of fruitive activity or cultivate knowledge by the mental speculative process one who is devoted to the supreme personality can attain all the benefits derived from other yogic processes speculation rituals sacrifices charities etc that is the specific benediction of devotional service simply by chanting the holy name of kahare ka hare ka ka ka hare hare hare rma hare rma rma rma hare harea devotee of the lord can approach the supreme destination easily and happily but this destination cannot be approached by any other process of religion the conclusion of bhagavadgt is stated in the eighteenth chapter sarvadharmn parityajya mm eka araa vraja aha tv sarvappebhyo mokayiymi m uca bg 1866 one should give up all other processes of selfrealization and simply execute devotional service in ka consciousness that will enable one to reach the copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved highest perfection of life there is no need for one to consider the sinful actions of his past life because the supreme lord fully takes charge of him

bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved applies to one who has actually developed an attachment for ka the supreme personality of godhead by transcendental love and the other is for one who has not developed an attachment for the supreme person by transcendental love for this second class there are different prescribed rules and regulations one can follow to be ultimately elevated to the stage of attachment to ka bhaktiyoga is the purification of the senses at the present moment in material existence the senses are always impure being engaged in sense gratification but by the practice of bhaktiyoga these senses can become purified and in the purified state they come directly in contact with the supreme lord in this material existence i may be engaged in some service to some master but i dont really lovingly serve my master i simply serve to get some money and the master also is not in love he takes service from me and pays me so there is no question of love but for spiritual life one must be elevated to the pure stage of love that stage of love can be achieved by practice of devotional service performed with the present senses this love of god is now in a dormant state in everyones heart and there love of god is manifested in different ways but it is contaminated by material association now the heart has to be purified of the material association and that dormant natural love for ka has to be revived that is the whole process to practice the regulative principles of bhaktiyoga one should under the guidance of an expert spiritual master follow certain principles one should rise early in the morning take bath enter the temple and offer prayers and chant hare ka then collect flowers to offer to the deity cook foodstuffs to offer to the deity take prasdam and so on there are various rules and regulations which one should follow and one should constantly hear bhagavadgt and rmadbhgavatam from pure devotees this practice can help anyone rise to the level of love of god and then he is sure of his progress into the spiritual kingdom of god this practice of bhaktiyoga under the rules and regulations with the direction of a spiritual master will

be sympathetic to the propagation of ka consciousness there are many devotees who are engaged in the propagation of ka consciousness and they require help so even if one cannot directly practice the regulative principles of bhaktiyoga he can try to help such work every endeavor requires land capital organization and labor just as in business one requires a place to stay some capital to use some labor and some organization to expand copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved so the same is required in the service of ka the only difference is that in materialism one works for sense gratification the same work however can be performed for the satisfaction of ka and that is spiritual activity if one has sufficient money he can help in building an office or temple for propagating ka consciousness or he can help with publications there are various fields of activity and one should be interested in such activities if one cannot sacrifice the results of his activities the same person can still sacrifice some percentage to propagate ka consciousness this voluntary service to the cause of ka consciousness will help one to rise to a higher state of love for

familial or religious considerations or because of some other impediments if one attaches himself directly to the activities of ka consciousness there may be objections from family members or so many other difficulties for one who has such a problem it is advised that he sacrifice the accumulated result of his activities to some good cause such procedures are described in the vedic rules there are many descriptions of sacrifices and special functions of puya or special work in which the result of ones previous action may be applied thus one may gradually become elevated to the state of knowledge it is also found that when one who is not even interested in the activities of ka consciousness gives charity to some hospital or some other social institution he gives up the hardearned results of his activities that is also recommended here because by the practice of giving up the fruits of ones activities one is sure to purify his mind gradually and in that purified stage of mind one becomes able to understand ka consciousness of course ka consciousness is not dependent on any other experience because ka consciousness itself can purify ones mind but if there are impediments to accepting ka consciousness one may try to give up the results of his actions in that respect social service community service national service sacrifice for ones country etc may be accepted so that some day one may come to the stage of pure devotional service to the supreme lord in bhagavadgt 1846 we find it is stated yata pravttir bhtnm if one decides to sacrifice for the supreme cause even if he does not know that the supreme cause is ka he will come gradually to understand that ka is the supreme cause by the sacrificial method text 12 eyaae ih janamayaasaajjanaayana ivixazyatae

of devotional service the way of regulative principles and the way of full attachment in love to the supreme personality of godhead for those who are actually not able to follow the principles of ka consciousness it is better to cultivate knowledge because by knowledge one can be able to understand his real position gradually knowledge will develop to the point of meditation by meditation one can be able to understand the supreme personality of godhead by a gradual process there are processes which make one understand that one himself is the supreme and that sort of meditation is preferred if one is unable to engage in devotional service if one is not able to meditate in such a way then there are prescribed duties as enjoined in the vedic literature for the brhmaas katriyas vaiyas and dras which we shall find in the last chapter of bhagavadgt but in all cases one should give up the result or fruits of labor this means to employ the result of karma for some good cause copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved in summary to reach the supreme personality of godhead the highest goal there are two processes one process is by gradual development and the other process is direct devotional service in ka consciousness is the direct method and the other method involves renouncing the fruits of ones activities then one can come to the stage of knowledge then to the stage of meditation then to the stage of understanding the supersoul and then to the stage of the supreme personality of godhead one may take either the stepbystep process or the direct path the direct process is not possible for everyone therefore the indirect process is also good it is however to be understood that the indirect process is not recommended for arjuna because he is already at the stage of loving devotional service to the supreme lord it is for others who are not at this stage for them the gradual process of renunciation knowledge meditation and realization of the supersoul and brahman should be followed but as far as bhagavadgt is concerned it is the direct method that is stressed everyone is advised to take to the direct method and surrender unto the supreme personality of godhead ka texts 1314 aea savrautaanaa maea ka wv c inamarmaae inarhar samadusau amaq 13 santau satata yaaegaq yataatmaa dinaya mayyaipartamanaaebuiyaaer ma sa mae ipaya 14 adve

on mesuch a devotee of mine is very dear to me purport coming again to the point of pure devotional service the lord is describing the transcendental qualifications of a pure devotee in these two verses a pure devotee is never disturbed in any circumstances nor is he envious of anyone nor does a devotee become his enemys enemy he thinks this person is acting as my enemy due to my own past misdeeds so it is better to suffer than to protest in the rmadbhgavatam 10148 it is stated tat te nukamp susamkamo bhujna evtmakta vipkam whenever a devotee is in distress or has fallen into difficulty he thinks that it is the lords mercy upon him he thinks thanks to my past misdeeds i should suffer far far greater than i am suffering now so it is by the mercy of the supreme lord that i am not getting all the punishment i am due i am just getting a little by the mercy copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved of the supreme personality of godhead therefore he is always calm quiet and patient despite many distressful conditions a devotee is also always kind to everyone even to his enemy nirmama means that a devotee does not attach much importance to the pains and trouble pertaining to the body because he knows perfectly well that he is not the material body he does not identify with the body therefore he is freed from the conception of false ego and is equipoised in happiness and distress he is tolerant and he is satisfied with whatever comes by the grace of the supreme lord he does not endeavor much to achieve something with great difficulty therefore he is always joyful he is a completely perfect mystic because he is fixed in the instructions received from the spiritual master and because his senses are controlled he is determined he is not swayed by false arguments because no one can lead him from the fixed determination of devotional service he is fully conscious that ka is the eternal lord so no one can disturb him all these qualifications enable him to fix his mind and intelligence entirely on the supreme lord such a standard of devotional service is undoubtedly very rare but a devotee becomes situated in that stage by following the regulative principles of devotional service furthermore the lord says that such a devotee is very dear to him for the lord is always pleased with all his activities in full ka

in the path of impersonal brahman or one who is engaged in the personal service of the supreme personality of godheadwas raised by arjuna and the lord replied to him so explicitly that there is no doubt that devotional service to the personality of godhead is the best of all processes of spiritual realization in other words in this chapter it is decided that through good association one develops attachment for pure devotional service and thereby accepts a bona fide spiritual master and from him begins to hear and chant and observe the regulative principles of copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved devotional service with faith attachment and devotion and thus becomes engaged in the transcendental service of the lord this path is recommended in this chapter therefore there is no doubt that devotional service is the only absolute path for selfrealization for the attainment of the supreme personality of godhead the impersonal conception of the supreme absolute truth as described in this chapter is recommended only up to the time one surrenders himself for selfrealization in other words as long as one does not have the chance to associate

is called the knower of the field purport arjuna was inquisitive about prakti nature purua the enjoyer ketra the field ketraja its knower and knowledge and the object of knowledge when he inquired about all these ka said that this body is called the field and that one who knows this body is called the knower of the field this body is the field of activity for the conditioned soul the conditioned soul is entrapped in material existence and he attempts to lord it over material nature and so according to his capacity to dominate material nature he gets a field of activity that field of activity is the body and what is the body the body is made of senses the conditioned soul wants to enjoy sense gratification and according to his capacity to enjoy sense gratification he is offered a body or field of activity therefore the body is called ketra or the field of activity for the conditioned soul now the person who should not identify himself with the body is called ketraja the knower of the field it is not very difficult to understand the difference between the field and its knower the body and the knower of the body any person can consider that from childhood to old age he undergoes so many changes of body and yet is still one person remaining thus there is a difference between the knower of the field of activities and the actual field of activities a living conditioned soul can thus understand that he is different from the body it is described in the beginningdehino sminthat the living entity is within the body and that the body is changing from childhood to boyhood and from boyhood to youth and from youth to old age and the person who owns the body knows that the body is changing the owner is distinctly ketraja sometimes we think i am happy i am a man i am a woman i am a dog i am a cat these are the bodily designations of the knower but the knower is different from the body although we may use many articlesour clothes etcwe know that we are different from the things used similarly we also understand by a little contemplation that we are different from the body i or you or copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved anyone else who owns the body is called ketraja the knower of the field of activities and the body is called ketra the field of activities itself in the first six chapters of bhagavadgt the knower of the body the living entity and the position by which he can understand the supreme lord are described in the middle six chapters of the bhagavadgt the supreme personality of godhead and the relationship between the individual soul and the supersoul in regard to devotional service are described the superior position of the supreme personality of godhead and the subordinate position of the individual soul are definitely defined in these chapters the living entities are subordinate under all circumstances but in their forgetfulness they are suffering when enlightened by pious activities they approach the supreme lord in different capacitiesas the distressed those in want of money the inquisitive and those in search of knowledge that is also described now starting with the thirteenth chapter how the living entity comes into contact with material nature and how he is delivered by the supreme lord through the different methods of fruitive activities cultivation of knowledge and the discharge of devotional service are explained although the living entity is completely different from the material body he somehow becomes related this also is explained text 3 aeaj caipa maa ivi savraeaezu aarta

the lord the living entity and matter in every field of activities in every body there are two souls the individual soul and the supersoul because the supersoul is the plenary expansion of the supreme personality of godhead ka ka says i am also the knower but i am not the individual knower of the body i am the superknower i am present in every body as the paramtm or supersoul one who studies the subject matter of the field of activity and the knower of the field very minutely in terms of this bhagavadgt can attain to knowledge the lord says i am the knower of the field of activities in every individual body the individual may be the knower of his own body but he is not in knowledge of other bodies the supreme personality of godhead who is present as the supersoul in all bodies knows everything about all bodies he knows all the different bodies of all the various species of life a citizen may know everything about his patch of land but the king knows not only his palace but all the properties possessed by the individual citizens similarly one may be the proprietor of the body individually but the supreme lord is the proprietor of all bodies the king is the original proprietor of the kingdom and the citizen is the secondary proprietor similarly the supreme lord is the copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved supreme proprietor of all bodies the body consists of the senses the supreme lord is hkea which means the controller of the senses he is the original controller of the senses just as the king is the original controller of all the activities of the state the citizens are secondary controllers the lord says i am also the knower this means that he is the superknower the individual soul knows only his particular body in the vedic literature it is stated as follows ketri hi arri bja cpi ubhubhe tni vetti sa yogtm tata ketraja ucyate this body is called the ketra and within it dwells the owner of the body and the supreme lord who knows both the body and the owner of the body therefore he is called the knower of all fields the distinction between the field of activities the knower of activities and the supreme knower of activities is described as follows perfect knowledge of the constitution of the body the constitution of the individual soul and the constitution of the supersoul is known in terms of vedic literature as jna that is the opinion of ka to understand both the soul and the supersoul as one yet distinct is knowledge one who does not understand the field of activity and the knower of activity is not in perfect knowledge one has to understand the position of prakti nature purua the enjoyer of nature and vara the knower who dominates or controls nature and the individual soul one should not confuse the three in their different capacities one should not confuse the painter the painting and the easel this material world which is the field of activities is nature and the enjoyer of nature is the living entity and above them both is the supreme controller the personality of godhead it is stated in the vedic language in the vetvatara upaniad 112 bhokt bhogya preritra ca matv sarva prokta tri vidhambrahmam etat there are three brahman conceptions prakti is brahman as the field of activities and the jva individual soul is also brahman and is trying to control material nature and the controller of both of them is also brahman but he is the factual controller copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved in this chapter it will also be explained that out of the two knowers one is fallible and the other is infallible one is superior and the other is subordinate one who understands the two knowers of the field to be one and the same contradicts the supreme personality of godhead who states here very clearly i am also the knower of the field of activity one who misunderstands a rope to be a serpent is not in knowledge there are different kinds of bodies and there are different owners of the bodies because each individual soul has his individual capacity for lording it over material nature there are different bodies but the supreme also is present in them as the controller the word ca is significant for it indicates the total number of bodies that is the opinion of rla baladeva vidybhaa ka is the supersoul present in each and every body apart from the individual soul and ka explicitly says here that the supersoul is the controller of both the field of activities and the finite enjoyer text 4 tataea ya yaadkc yaikair yata yata sa c yaae yatpaaav

various vedic writings it is especially presented in vedntastra with all reasoning as to cause and effect purport the supreme personality of godhead ka is the highest authority in explaining this knowledge still as a matter of course learned scholars and standard authorities always give evidence from previous authorities ka is explaining this most controversial point regarding the duality and nonduality of the soul and the supersoul by referring to a scripture the vednta which is accepted as authority first he says this is according to different sages as far as the sages are concerned besides himself vysadeva the author of the vedntastra is a great sage and in the vedntastra duality is perfectly explained and vysadevas father parara is also a great sage and he writes in his books of religiosity aham tva ca tathnye weyou i and the various other living entitiesare all transcendental although in material bodies now we are fallen into the ways of the three modes of material nature according to our different karma as such some are on higher levels and some are in the lower nature the higher and lower natures exist due to ignorance and are being manifested in an infinite number of living entities but the supersoul which is infallible is uncontaminated by the three qualities of nature and is transcendental similarly in the original vedas a distinction between the soul the supersoul and the body is made especially in the kaha upaniad there are many great sages who have explained this and parara is considered principal among them the word chandobhi refers to the various vedic literatures the taittirya upaniad for example which is a branch of the yajur veda describes nature copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved the living entity and the supreme personality of godhead as stated before ketra is the field of activities and there are two kinds of ketraja the individual living entity and the supreme living entity as stated in the taittirya upaniad 29 brahma puccha pratih there is a manifestation of the supreme lords energy known as annamaya dependence upon food for existence this is a materialistic realization of the supreme then in pramaya after realizing the supreme absolute truth in food one can realize the absolute truth in the living symptoms or life forms in jnamaya realization extends beyond the living symptoms to the point of thinking feeling and willing then there is brahman realization called vijnamaya in which the living entitys mind and life symptoms are distinguished from the living entity himself the next and supreme stage is nandamaya realization of the allblissful nature thus there are five stages of brahman realization which are called brahma puccham out of these the first threeannamaya pramaya and jnamayainvolve the fields of activities of the living entities transcendental to all these fields of activities is the supreme lord who is called nandamaya the vedntastra also describes the supreme by saying nandamayo bhyst the supreme personality of godhead is by nature full of joy to enjoy his transcendental bliss he expands into vijnamaya pramaya jnamaya and annamaya in the field of activities the living entity is considered to be the enjoyer and different from him is the nandamaya that means that if the living entity decides to enjoy in dovetailing himself with the nandamaya then he becomes perfect this is the real picture of the supreme lord as the supreme knower of the field the living entity as the subordinate knower and the nature of the field of activities one has to search for this truth in the vedntastra or brahmastra it is mentioned here that the codes of the brahmastra are very nicely arranged according to cause and effect some of the stras or aphorisms are na

and its interactions purport from all the authoritative statements of the great sages the vedic hymns and the aphorisms of the vedntastra the components of this world can be understood as follows first there are earth water fire air and ether these are the five great elements mahbhta then there are false ego intelligence and the unmanifested stage of the three modes of nature then there are five senses for acquiring knowledge the eyes ears nose tongue and skin then five working senses voice legs hands anus and genitals then above the senses there is the mind which is within and which can be called the sense within therefore including the mind there are eleven senses altogether then there are the five objects of the senses smell taste form touch and sound now the aggregate of these twentyfour elements is called the field of activity if one makes an analytical study of these twentyfour subjects then he can very well understand the field of activity then there are desire hatred happiness and distress which are interactions representations of the five great elements in the gross body the living symptoms represented by consciousness and conviction are the manifestation of the subtle bodymind ego and intelligence these subtle elements are included within the field of activities the five great elements are a gross representation of the false ego which in turn represents the primal stage of false ego technically called the materialistic conception or tmasabuddhi intelligence in ignorance this further represents the unmanifested stage of the three modes of material nature the unmanifested modes of material nature are called pradhna one who desires to know the twentyfour elements in detail along with their interactions should study the philosophy in more detail in bhagavadgt a summary only is given the body is the representation of all these factors and there are changes of the body which are six in number the body is born it grows it stays it produces

besides this whatever there may be is ignorance purport this process of knowledge is sometimes misunderstood by less intelligent men as being the interaction of the field of activity but actually this

this is actually the means to get out of the entanglement of those elements the embodied soul is entrapped by the body which is a casing made of the twentyfour elements and the process of knowledge as described here is the means to get out of it of all the descriptions of the process of knowledge the most important point is described in the first line of the eleventh verse mayi cnanyayogena bhaktir avyabhicri the process of knowledge terminates in unalloyed devotional service to the lord so if one does not approach or is not able to approach the transcendental service of the lord then the other nineteen items are of no particular value but if one takes to devotional service in full ka consciousness the other nineteen items automatically develop within him as stated in rmadbhgavatam 51812 yasysti bhaktir bhagavaty akican sarvair guais tatra samsate sur all the good qualities of knowledge develop in one who has attained the stage of devotional service the principle of copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved accepting a spiritual master as mentioned in the eighth verse is essential even for one who takes to devotional service it is most important transcendental life begins when one accepts a bona fide spiritual master the supreme personality of godhead r ka clearly states here that this process of knowledge is the actual path anything speculated beyond this is nonsense as for the knowledge outlined here the items may be analyzed as follows humility means that one should not be anxious to have the satisfaction of being honored by others the material conception of life makes us very eager to receive honor from others but from the point of view of a man in perfect knowledgewho knows that he is not this bodyanything honor or dishonor pertaining to this body is useless one should not be hankering after this material deception people are very anxious to be famous for their religion and consequently sometimes it is found that without understanding the principles of religion one enters into some group which is not actually following religious principles and then wants to advertise himself as a religious mentor as for actual advancement in spiritual science one should have a test to see how far he is progressing he can judge by these items nonviolence is generally taken to mean not killing or destroying the body but actually nonviolence means not to put others into distress people in general are trapped by ignorance in the material concept of life and they perpetually suffer material pains so unless one elevates people to spiritual knowledge one is practicing violence one should try his best to distribute real knowledge to the people so that they may become enlightened and leave this material entanglement that is nonviolence tolerance means that one should be practiced to bear insult and dishonor from others if one is engaged in the advancement of spiritual knowledge there will be so many insults and much dishonor from others this is expected because material nature is so constituted even a boy like prahlda who only five years old was engaged in the cultivation of spiritual knowledge was endangered when his father became antagonistic to his devotion the father tried to kill him in so many ways but prahlda tolerated him so there may be many impediments to making advancement in spiritual knowledge but we copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved should be tolerant and continue our progress with determination simplicity means that without diplomacy one should be so straightforward that he can disclose the real truth even to an enemy as for acceptance of the spiritual master that is essential because without the instruction of a bona fide spiritual master one cannot progress in the spiritual science one should approach the spiritual master with all humility and offer him all services so that he will be pleased to bestow his blessings upon the disciple because a bona fide spiritual master is a representative of ka if he bestows any blessings upon his disciple that will make the disciple immediately advanced without the disciples following the regulative principles or the regulative principles will be easier for one who has served the spiritual master without reservation cleanliness is essential for making advancement in spiritual life there are two kinds of cleanliness external and internal external cleanliness means taking a bath but for internal cleanliness one has to think of ka always and chant hare ka hare ka ka ka hare hare hare rma hare rma rma rma hare hare this process cleans the accumulated dust of past karma from the mind steadiness means that one should be very determined to make progress in spiritual life without such determination one cannot make tangible progress and selfcontrol means that one should not accept anything which is detrimental to the path of spiritual progress one should become accustomed to this and reject anything which is against the path of spiritual progress this is real renunciation the senses are so strong that they are always anxious to have sense gratification one should not cater to these demands which are not necessary the senses should only be gratified to keep the body fit so that one can discharge his duty in advancing in spiritual life the most important and uncontrollable sense is the tongue if one can control the tongue then there is every possibility of controlling the other senses the function of the tongue is to taste and to vibrate therefore by systematic regulation the tongue should always be engaged in tasting the remnants of foodstuffs offered to ka and chanting hare ka as far as the eyes are concerned they should not be allowed to see anything but the beautiful form of ka that will control the copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved eyes similarly the ears should be engaged in hearing about ka and the nose in smelling the flowers offered to ka this is the process of devotional service and it is understood here that bhagavadgt is simply expounding the science of devotional service devotional service is the main and sole objective unintelligent commentators on the bhagavadgt try to divert the mind of the reader to other subjects but there is no other subject in bhagavadgt than devotional service false ego means accepting this body as oneself when one understands that he is not his body and is spirit soul he comes to his real ego ego is there false ego is condemned but not real ego in the vedic literature bhadrayaka upaniad 1410 it is said aha brahmsmi i am brahman i am spirit this i am the sense of self also exists in the liberated stage of selfrealization this sense of i am is ego but when the sense of i am is applied to this false body it is false ego when the sense of self is applied to reality that is real ego there are some philosophers who say we should give up our ego but we cannot give up our ego because ego means identity we ought of course to give up the false identification with the body one should try to understand the distress of accepting birth death old age and disease there are descriptions in various vedic literatures of birth in the rmadbhgavatam the world of the unborn the childs stay in the womb of the mother its suffering etc are all very graphically described it should be thoroughly understood that birth is distressful because we forget how much distress we have suffered within the womb of the mother we do not make any solution to the repetition of birth and death similarly at the time of death there are all kinds of sufferings and they are also mentioned in the authoritative scriptures these should be discussed and as far as disease and old age are concerned everyone gets practical experience no one wants to be diseased and no one wants to become old but there is no avoiding these unless we have a pessimistic view of this material life considering the distresses of birth death old age and disease there is no impetus for our making advancement in spiritual life as for detachment from children wife and home it is not meant that one should have no feeling for these they are natural objects of affection but copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved when they are not favorable to spiritual progress then one should not be attached to them the best process for making the home pleasant is ka consciousness if one is in full ka consciousness he can make his home very happy because this process of ka consciousness is very easy one need only chant hare ka hare ka ka ka hare hare hare rma hare rma rma rma hare hare accept the remnants of foodstuffs offered to ka have some discussion on books like bhagavadgt and rmadbhgavatam and engage oneself in deity worship these four things will make one happy one should train the members of his family in this way the family members can sit down morning and evening and chant together hare ka hare ka ka ka hare hare hare rma hare rma rma rma hare hare if one can mold his family life in this way to develop ka consciousness following these four principles then there is no need to change from family life to renounced life but if it is not congenial not favorable for spiritual advancement then family life should be abandoned one must sacrifice everything to realize or serve ka just as arjuna did arjuna did not want to kill his family members but when he understood that these family members were impediments to his ka realization he accepted the instruction of ka and fought and killed them in all cases one should be detached from the happiness and distress of family life because in this world one can never be fully happy or fully miserable happiness and distress are concomitant factors of material life one should learn to tolerate as advised in bhagavadgt one can never restrict the coming and going of happiness and distress so one should be detached from the materialistic way of life and be automatically equipoised in both cases generally when we get something desirable we are very happy and when we get something undesirable we are distressed but if we are actually in the spiritual position these things will not agitate us to reach that stage we have to practice unbreakable devotional service devotional service to ka without deviation means engaging oneself in the nine processes of devotional servicechanting hearing worshiping offering respect etcas described in the last verse of the ninth chapter that process should be followed naturally when one is adapted to the spiritual way of life he will not want copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved to mix with materialistic men that would go against his grain one may test himself by seeing how far he is inclined to live in a solitary place without unwanted association naturally a devotee has no taste for unnecessary sporting or cinemagoing or enjoying some social function because he understands that these are simply a waste of time there are many research scholars and philosophers who study sex life or some other subject but according to bhagavadgt such research work and philosophical speculation have no value that is more or less nonsensical according to bhagavadgt one should make research by philosophical discretion into the nature of the soul one should make research to understand the self that is recommended here as far as selfrealization is concerned it is clearly stated here that bhaktiyoga is especially practical as soon as there is a question of devotion one must consider the relationship between the supersoul and the individual soul the individual soul and the supersoul cannot be one at least not in the bhakti conception the devotional conception of life this service of the individual soul to the supreme soul is eternal nityam as it is clearly stated so bhakti or devotional service is eternal one should be established in that philosophical conviction in the rmadbhgavatam 1211 this is explained vadanti tat tattvavidas tattva yaj jnam advayam those who are actually knowers of the absolute truth know that the self is realized in three different phases as brahman paramtm and bhagavn bhagavn is the last word in the realization of the absolute truth therefore one should reach up to that platform of understanding the supreme personality of godhead and thus engage in the devotional service of the lord that is the perfection of knowledge beginning from practicing humility up to the point of realization of the supreme truth the absolute personality of godhead this process is just like a staircase beginning from the ground floor and going up to the top floor now on this staircase there are so many people who have reached the first floor the second or the third floor etc but unless one reaches the top floor which is the understanding of ka he is at a lower stage of knowledge if anyone wants to compete with god and at the same time make advancement in copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved spiritual knowledge he will be frustrated it is clearly stated that without humility understanding is not truly possible to think oneself god is most puffed up although the living entity is always being kicked by the stringent laws of material nature he still thinks i am god because of ignorance the beginning of knowledge therefore is amnitva humility one should be humble and know that he is subordinate to the supreme lord due to rebellion against the supreme lord one becomes subordinate to material nature one must know and be convinced of this truth text 13 jeya yatatpavyaaima yajjatvamatamanutae

activities now he begins to explain the knowable first the soul and then the supersoul by knowledge of the knower both the soul and the supersoul one can relish the nectar of life as explained in the second chapter the living entity is eternal this is also confirmed here there is no specific date at which the jva was born nor can anyone trace out the history of the jvtms manifestation from the supreme lord therefore it is beginningless the vedic literature confirms this na jyate mriyate v vipacit kaha upaniad 1218 the knower of the body is never born and never dies and he is full of knowledge the supreme lord as the supersoul is also stated in the vedic literature vetvatara upaniad 616 to be pradhnaketrajapatir guea the chief knower of the body and the master of the three modes of material nature in the smti it is said dsabhto harer eva nnyasvaiva kadcana the living entities are eternally in the service of the supreme lord this is also confirmed by lord caitanya in his teachings therefore the description of brahman mentioned in this verse is in relation to the individual soul and when the word brahman is applied to the living entity it is to be understood that he is

everywhere that is not possible if he thinks that under ignorance he is not conscious that his hands and legs are diffused all over but when he attains to proper knowledge he will come to that stage his thinking is contradictory this means that the individual soul having become conditioned by material nature is not supreme the supreme is different from the individual soul the supreme lord can extend his hand without limit the individual soul cannot in bhagavadgt the lord says that if anyone offers him a flower or a fruit or a little water he accepts it if the lord is a far distance away how can he accept things this is the omnipotence of the lord even though he is situated in his own abode far far away from earth he can extend his hand to accept what anyone offers that is his potency

means the material modes but his senses are without material covering it should be understood that his senses are not exactly like ours although he is the source of all our sensory activities he has his transcendental senses which are uncontaminated this is very nicely explained in the vetvatara upaniad 319 in the verse apipdo javano graht the supreme personality of godhead has no hands which are materially contaminated but he has his hands and accepts whatever sacrifice is offered to him that is the distinction between the conditioned soul and the supersoul he has no material eyes but he has

he has spiritual legs in other words the lord is not impersonal he has his eyes legs hands and everything else and because we are part and parcel of the supreme lord we also have these things but his hands legs eyes and senses are not contaminated by material nature bhagavadgt also confirms that when the lord appears he appears as he is by his internal potency he is not contaminated by the material energy because he is the lord of material energy in the vedic literature we find that his whole embodiment is spiritual he has his eternal form called saccidnandavigraha bs 51 he is full of all opulence he is the proprietor of all wealth and the owner of all energy he is the most intelligent and is full of knowledge these are some of the symptoms of the supreme personality of godhead he

supreme lord although the maintainer of every living entity devours everything at the time of annihilation this was confirmed in the eleventh chapter when the lord said that he had come to devour all the warriors assembled at kuruketra he also mentioned that in the form of time he devours also he is the annihilator the killer of all when there is creation he develops all from their original state

of the supreme lord is there in the material world that brahmajyoti the lords spiritual effulgence is covered by the mahattattva the material elements therefore in this material world we require the assistance of sun moon electricity etc for light but in the spiritual world there is no need of such things it is clearly stated in the vedic literature that because of his luminous effulgence everything is illuminated it is clear therefore that his situation is not in the material world he is situated in the spiritual world which is far far away in the spiritual sky that is also confirmed in the vedic literature dityavara tamasa parastt vetvatara upaniad 38 he is just like the sun eternally luminous but he is far far beyond the darkness of this material world his knowledge is

summarily described by me only my devotees can understand this thoroughly and thus attain to my nature purport the lord has described in summary the body knowledge and the knowable this knowledge is of three things the knower the knowable and the process of knowing combined these are called vijna or the science of knowledge perfect knowledge can be understood by the unalloyed devotees of the lord directly others are unable to understand the monists say that at the ultimate stage these three items become one but the devotees do not accept this knowledge and development of knowledge mean understanding oneself in ka consciousness we are being led by material consciousness but as soon as we transfer all consciousness to kas activities and realize that ka is everything then we attain real knowledge in other words knowledge is nothing but the preliminary stage of understanding devotional service perfectly in the fifteenth chapter this will be very clearly explained now to summarize one may understand that verses 6 and 7 beginning from mahbhtni and continuing through cetan dhti analyze the material elements and certain manifestations of the symptoms of life these combine to form the body or the field of activities and verses 8 through 12 from amnitvam through tattvajnrthadaranam describe the process of knowledge for understanding both types of knower of the field of activities namely the soul and the supersoul then verses 13 through 18 beginning from andi matparam and continuing through hdi sarvasya vihitam describe the soul and the supreme lord or the supersoul thus three items have been described the field of activity the body the process of understanding and both the soul and the supersoul it is especially described here that only the unalloyed devotees of the lord can understand these three items clearly so for these devotees bhagavadgt is fully useful it is they who can attain the supreme goal the nature of the supreme lord ka in other words only

individual soul that is embodied and enjoying the activities of the body is the purua or the living entity he is one knower and the other is the supersoul of course it is to be understood that both the supersoul and the individual entity are different manifestations of the supreme personality of copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved godhead the living entity is in the category of his energy and the supersoul is in the category of his personal expansion both material nature and the living entity are eternal that is to say that they existed before the creation the material manifestation is from the energy of the supreme lord and so also are the living entities but the living entities are of the superior energy both the living entities and material nature existed before this cosmos was manifested material nature was absorbed in the supreme personality of godhead mahviu and when it was required it was manifested by the agency of mahattattva similarly the living entities are also in him and because they are conditioned they are averse to serving the supreme lord thus they are not allowed to enter into the spiritual sky but with the coming forth of material nature these living entities are again given a chance to act in the material world and prepare themselves to enter into the spiritual world that is the mystery of this material creation actually the living entity is originally the spiritual part and parcel of the supreme lord but due to his rebellious nature he is conditioned within material nature it really does not matter how these living entities or superior entities of the supreme lord have come in contact with material nature the supreme personality of godhead knows however how and why this actually took place in the scriptures the lord says that those attracted by this material nature are undergoing a hard struggle for existence but we should know it with certainty from the descriptions of these few verses that all transformations and influences of material nature by the three modes are also productions of material nature all transformations and variety in respect to living entities are due to the body as

due to material nature there are 8400000 different species of life and these varieties are creations of the material nature they arise from the different sensual pleasures of the living entity who thus desires to live in this body or that when he is put into different bodies he enjoys different kinds of happiness and distress his material happiness and distress are due to his body and not to himself as he is in his original state there is no doubt of enjoyment therefore that is his real state because of the desire to lord it over material nature he is in the material world in the spiritual world there is no such thing the spiritual world is pure but in the material world everyone is struggling hard to acquire different kinds of pleasures for the body it might be more clear to state that this body is the effect of the senses the senses are instruments for gratifying desire now the sum totalbody and instrument sensesare offered by material nature and as will be clear in the next verse the living entity is blessed or damned with circumstances according to his past desire and activity according to ones desires and activities material nature copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved places one in various residential quarters the being himself is the cause of his attaining such residential quarters and his attendant enjoyment or suffering once placed in some particular kind of body he comes under the control of nature because the body being matter acts according to the laws of nature at that time the living entity has no power to change that law suppose an entity is put into the body of a dog as soon as he is put into the body of a dog he must act like a dog he cannot act otherwise and if the living entity is put into the body of a hog then he is forced to eat stool and act like a hog similarly if the living entity is put into the body of a demigod he must act according to his body this is the law of nature but in all circumstances the supersoul is with the individual soul that is explained in the vedas muaka upaniad 311 as follows dv supar sayuj sakhya the supreme lord is so kind upon the living entity that he

association with that material nature thus he meets with good and evil among various species purport this verse is very important for an understanding of how the living entities transmigrate from one body to another it is explained in the second chapter that the living entity is transmigrating from one body to another just as one changes dress this change of dress is due to his attachment to material existence as long as he is captivated by this false manifestation he has to continue transmigrating from one body to another due to his desire to lord it over material nature he is put into such undesirable circumstances under the influence of material desire the entity is born sometimes as a demigod sometimes as a man sometimes as a beast as a bird as a worm as an aquatic as a saintly man as a bug this is going on and in all cases the living entity thinks himself to be the master of his circumstances yet he is under the influence of material nature how he is put into such different bodies is explained here it is due to association with the different modes of nature one has to rise therefore above the three material modes and become situated in the transcendental position that is called ka consciousness unless one is situated in ka consciousness his material consciousness will oblige him to transfer from one body to another because he has material desires since time immemorial but he has to change that conception that change can be effected only by hearing from authoritative sources the best example is here arjuna is hearing the science of god from ka the living entity if he submits to this hearing process will lose his longcherished desire to dominate material nature and gradually and proportionately as he reduces his long desire to dominate he comes to enjoy spiritual happiness in a vedic mantra it is said that as he becomes learned in association with the supreme personality of godhead he copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights

enjoyer his name is paramtm not tm and he is transcendental it is distinctly clear that the tm and paramtm are different the supersoul the paramtm has legs and hands everywhere but the individual soul does not and because the paramtm is the supreme lord he is present within to sanction the individual souls desiring material enjoyment without the sanction of the supreme soul the individual soul cannot do anything the individual is bhukta or the sustained and the lord is bhokt or the maintainer there are innumerable living entities and he is staying in them as a friend the fact is that every individual living entity is eternally part and parcel of the supreme lord and both of them are very intimately related as friends but the living entity has the tendency to reject the sanction of the supreme lord and act independently in an attempt to dominate nature and because he has this tendency he is called the marginal energy of the supreme lord the living entity can be situated either in the material energy or in the spiritual energy as long as he is conditioned by the material energy the supreme lord as his friend the supersoul stays with him just to get him to return to the spiritual energy the lord is always eager to take him back to the spiritual energy but due to his minute independence the individual entity is continually rejecting the association of spiritual light this misuse of independence is the cause of his material strife in the conditioned nature the lord therefore is always giving instruction from within and from without from without he gives instructions as stated in bhagavadgt and from within he tries to convince the living entity that his activities in the material field are not conducive to real happiness just give it up and turn your faith toward me then you will be happy he says thus the intelligent person who places his faith in the paramtm or the supreme personality of godhead begins to advance toward a blissful eternal life of

selfrealization is concerned those who are atheists agnostics and skeptics are beyond the sense of spiritual understanding but there are others who are faithful in their understanding of spiritual life and they are called introspective devotees philosophers and workers who have renounced fruitive results those who always try to establish the doctrine of monism are also counted among the atheists and agnostics in copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved other words only the devotees of the supreme personality of godhead are best situated in spiritual understanding because they understand that beyond this material nature are the spiritual world and the supreme personality of godhead who is expanded as the paramtm the supersoul in everyone the allpervading godhead of course there are those who try to understand the supreme absolute truth by cultivation of knowledge and they can be counted in the class of the faithful the skhya philosophers analyze this material world into twentyfour elements and they place the individual soul as the twentyfifth item when they are able to understand the nature of the individual soul to be transcendental to the material elements they are able to understand also that above the individual soul there is the supreme personality of godhead he is the twentysixth element thus gradually they also come to the standard of devotional service in ka consciousness those who work without fruitive results are also perfect in their attitude they are given a chance to advance to the platform of devotional service in ka consciousness here it is stated that there are some people who are pure in consciousness and who try to find out the supersoul by meditation and when they discover the supersoul within themselves they become transcendentally situated similarly there are others who also try to understand the supreme soul by cultivation of knowledge and there are others who cultivate the hahayoga system and who try to satisfy the supreme personality of godhead by childish activities text 26 anyae tvevmajaananta utvanyaeya opaasatae taeipa caitatarntyaev matyau uitaparayaaa 26 anye tv evam

again there are those who although not conversant in spiritual knowledge begin to worship the supreme person upon hearing about him from others because of their tendency to hear from authorities they also transcend the path of birth and death purport this verse is particularly applicable to modern society because in modern society there is practically no education in spiritual matters some of the people may appear to be atheistic or agnostic or philosophical but actually there is no knowledge of philosophy as for the common man if he is a good soul then there is a chance for advancement by hearing this hearing process is very important lord caitanya who preached ka consciousness in the modern world gave great stress to hearing because if the common man simply hears from authoritative sources he can progress especially according to lord caitanya if he hears the transcendental vibration hare ka hare ka ka ka hare hare hare rma hare rma rma rma hare hare it is stated therefore that all men should take advantage of hearing from realized souls and gradually become able to understand everything the worship of the supreme lord will then undoubtedly take place lord caitanya has said that in this age no one needs to change his position but one should give up the endeavor to understand the absolute truth by speculative reasoning one should learn to become the servant of those who are in copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved knowledge of the supreme lord if one is fortunate enough to take shelter of a pure devotee hear from him about selfrealization and follow in his footsteps one will be gradually elevated to the position of a pure devotee in this verse particularly the process of hearing is strongly recommended and this is very appropriate although the common man is often not as capable as socalled philosophers faithful hearing from an authoritative person will help one transcend this material existence and go back to

and there are many existences which are moving and all of them are but combinations of material nature and the superior nature the living entity without the touch of the superior nature the living entity nothing can grow the relationship between matter and nature is eternally going on and this combination is effected by the supreme lord therefore he is the controller of both the superior and

simply see the body and they think that when the body is destroyed everything is finished but actually it is not so after the destruction of the body both the soul and the supersoul exist and they go on eternally in many various moving and nonmoving forms the sanskrit word paramevara is sometimes translated as the individual soul because the soul is the master of the body and after the destruction of the body he transfers to another form in that way he is master but there are others who interpret this paramevara to be the supersoul in either case both the supersoul and the individual soul

as the sun alone illuminates all this universe so does the living entity one within the body illuminate the entire body by consciousness purport there are various theories regarding consciousness here in bhagavadgt the example of the sun and the sunshine is given as the sun is situated in one place but is illuminating the whole universe so a small particle of spirit soul although situated in the heart of this body is illuminating the whole body by consciousness thus consciousness is the proof of the presence of the soul as sunshine or light is the proof of the presence of the sun when the soul is present in the body there is consciousness all over the body and as soon as the soul has passed from the body there is no more consciousness this can be easily understood by any intelligent man therefore consciousness is not a product of the combinations of matter it is the symptom of the living entity the consciousness of the living entity although qualitatively one with the supreme consciousness is not supreme because the consciousness of one particular body does not share that of another body but the supersoul which is situated in all bodies as the friend of the individual soul is conscious of all bodies that is the difference between supreme consciousness and individual consciousness text 35 aeaaeajyaaerevmantar janacauza autapakitamaaea c yae ivduyaarinta tae parma 35

nature attain to the supreme goal purport the purport of this thirteenth chapter is that one should know the distinction between the body the owner of the body and the supersoul one should recognize the process of liberation as described in verses eight through twelve then one can go on to the supreme destination a faithful person should at first have some good association to hear of god and thus gradually become enlightened if one accepts a spiritual master one can learn to distinguish between matter and spirit and that becomes the steppingstone for further spiritual realization a spiritual master by various instructions teaches his students to get free from the material concept of life for instance in bhagavadgt we find ka instructing arjuna to free him from materialistic considerations one can understand that this body is matter it can be analyzed with its twentyfour elements the body is the gross manifestation and the subtle copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved manifestation is the mind and psychological effects and the symptoms of life are the interaction of these features but over and above this there is the soul and there is also the supersoul the soul and the supersoul are two this material world is working by the conjunction of the soul and the twentyfour material elements one who can see the constitution of the whole material manifestation as this combination of the soul and material elements and can also see the situation of the supreme soul becomes eligible for transfer to the spiritual world these things are meant for contemplation and for realization and one should have a complete understanding of this chapter with the help of the spiritual master thus end the bhaktivedanta purports to the thirteenth chapter of

personality of godhead now the lord himself is further enlightening arjuna if one understands this chapter through the process of philosophical speculation he will come to an understanding of devotional service in the thirteenth chapter it was clearly explained that by humbly developing knowledge one may possibly be freed from material entanglement it has also been explained that it is due to association with the modes of nature that the living entity is entangled in this material world now in this chapter the supreme personality explains what those modes of nature are how they act how they bind and how they give liberation the knowledge explained in this chapter is proclaimed by the supreme lord to be superior to the knowledge given so far in other chapters by understanding this knowledge various great sages attained perfection and transferred to the spiritual world the lord now explains the same knowledge in a better way this knowledge is far far superior to all other processes of copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved knowledge thus far explained and knowing this many attained perfection thus it is expected that one who understands this fourteenth chapter will attain perfection text 2 wd janamaupaaitya mama saadamyarmaagataa sagaeripa naaepajaayantae palyae na vyaqainta c 2 ida jnam upritya mama sdharmyam gat sarge pi nopajyante

creation or disturbed at the time of dissolution purport after acquiring perfect transcendental knowledge one acquires qualitative equality with the supreme personality of godhead becoming free from the repetition of birth and death one does not however lose his identity as an individual soul it is understood from vedic literature that the liberated souls who have reached the transcendental planets of the spiritual sky always look copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved to the lotus feet of the supreme lord being engaged in his transcendental loving service so even after liberation the devotees do not lose their individual identities generally in the material world whatever knowledge we get is contaminated by the three modes of material nature knowledge which is not contaminated by the three modes of nature is called transcendental knowledge as soon as one is situated in that transcendental knowledge he is on the same platform as the supreme person those who have no knowledge of the spiritual sky hold that after being freed from the material activities of the material form this spiritual identity becomes formless without any variegatedness however just as there is material variegatedness in this world in the spiritual world there is also variegatedness those in ignorance of this think that spiritual existence is opposed to material variety but actually in the spiritual sky one attains a spiritual form there are spiritual activities and the spiritual situation is called devotional life that atmosphere is said to be uncontaminated and there one is equal in quality with the supreme lord to obtain such knowledge one must develop all the spiritual qualities one who thus develops the spiritual qualities is not affected either by the creation or by the destruction of the material world text 3 mama yaaeinamarhdba taismangaa ddaamyahma samav savrautaanaa tataae avita aarta 3 mama yonir mahad brahma tasmin garbha dadhmy aham

mahattattva is the total cause of the total cosmic manifestation and that total substance of the material cause in which there are three modes of nature is sometimes called brahman the supreme personality impregnates that total substance and thus innumerable universes become possible this total material substance the mahattattva is described as brahman in the vedic literature muaka upaniad 1119 tasmd etad brahma nmarpam anna ca jyate the supreme person impregnates that brahman with the seeds of the living entities the twentyfour elements beginning from earth water fire and air are all material energy and they constitute what is called mahad brahma or the great brahman the material nature as explained in the seventh chapter beyond this there is another superior naturethe living entity into material nature the superior nature is mixed by the will of the supreme personality of godhead and thereafter all living entities are born of this material nature the scorpion lays its eggs in piles of rice and sometimes it is said that the scorpion is born out of rice but the rice is not the cause of the scorpion actually the eggs were laid by the mother similarly material nature is not the cause of the birth of the living entities the seed is given by the supreme personality of godhead and they only seem to come out as products of copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust

caalso anaghao sinless one translation o sinless one the mode of goodness being purer than the others is illuminating and it frees one from all sinful reactions those situated in that mode become

types of psychological manifestations are causes of the entities conditioned status in copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved nature how they are differently conditioned is explained in this section of bhagavadgt the mode of goodness is first considered the effect of developing the mode of goodness in the material world is that one becomes wiser than those otherwise conditioned a man in the mode of goodness is not so much affected by material miseries and he has a sense of advancement in material knowledge the representative type is the brhmaa who is supposed to be situated in the mode of goodness this sense of happiness is due to understanding that in the mode of goodness one is more or less free from sinful reactions actually in the vedic literature it is said that the mode of goodness means greater knowledge and a greater sense of happiness the difficulty here is that when a living entity is situated in the mode of goodness he becomes conditioned to feel that he is advanced in knowledge and is better than others in this way he becomes conditioned the best examples are the scientist and the philosopher each is very proud of his knowledge and because they generally improve their living conditions they feel a sort of material happiness this sense of advanced happiness in conditioned life makes them bound by the mode of goodness of material nature as such they are attracted toward working in the mode of goodness and as long as they have an attraction for working in that way they have to take some type of body in the modes of nature thus there is no likelihood of liberation or of being transferred to the spiritual world repeatedly one may become a philosopher a scientist or a poet and repeatedly become entangled in the same disadvantages of birth and death but due to the illusion of the material energy one thinks that that sort of life is pleasant text 7 rjaae ragaatmak ivi tazaasasamauvma taibdnaaita kaentaeya kmarsaena

dehinamthe embodied translation the mode of passion is born of unlimited desires and longings o son of kunt and because of this the embodied living entity is bound to material fruitive actions purport the mode of passion is characterized by the attraction between man and woman woman has attraction for man and man has attraction for woman this is called the mode of passion and when the mode of passion is increased one develops the hankering for material enjoyment he wants to enjoy sense gratification for sense gratification a man in the mode of passion wants some honor in society or in the nation and he wants to have a happy family with nice children wife and house these are the products of the mode of passion as long as one is hankering after these things he has to work very hard therefore it is clearly stated here that he becomes associated with the fruits of his activities and thus becomes bound by such activities in order to please his wife children and society and to keep up his prestige one has to work therefore the whole material world is more or less in the mode of passion modern civilization is considered to be advanced in the standard of the mode of passion

entities the results of this mode are madness indolence and sleep which bind the conditioned soul purport in this verse the specific application of the word tu is very significant this means that the mode of ignorance is a very peculiar qualification of the embodied soul the mode of ignorance is just the opposite of the mode of goodness in the mode of goodness by development of knowledge one can understand what is what but the mode of ignorance is just the opposite everyone under the spell of the mode of ignorance becomes mad and a madman cannot understand what is what instead of making advancement one becomes degraded the definition of the mode of ignorance is stated in copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved the vedic literature vastuythtmyajnvaraka viparyayajnajanaka tama under the spell of ignorance one cannot understand a thing as it is for example everyone can see that his grandfather has died and therefore he will also die man is mortal the children that he conceives will also die so death is sure still people are madly accumulating money and working very hard all day and night not caring for the eternal spirit this is madness in their madness they are very reluctant to make advancement in spiritual understanding such people are very lazy when they are invited to associate for spiritual understanding they are not much interested they are not even active like the man who is controlled by the mode of passion thus another symptom of one embedded in the mode of ignorance is that he sleeps more than is required six hours of sleep is sufficient but a man in the mode of ignorance sleeps at least ten or twelve hours a day such a man appears to be always dejected and is addicted to intoxicants and sleeping these are the symptoms of a person conditioned by the mode of ignorance text 9 satv saue sayaita rja kmaria aarta janamaavtya tau tama pamaade sayatyauta 9 sattva sukhe sajayati raja karmai bhrata jnam vtya tu tama pramde

mode of passion is prominent the modes of goodness and ignorance are defeated when the mode of goodness is prominent passion and ignorance are defeated and when the mode of ignorance is prominent passion and goodness are defeated this competition is always going on therefore one who is actually intent on advancing in ka consciousness has to transcend these three modes the prominence of some certain mode of nature is manifested in ones dealings in his activities in eating etc all this will be explained in later chapters but if one wants he can develop by practice the mode of goodness and thus defeat the modes of ignorance and passion one can similarly develop the mode of passion and defeat goodness and ignorance or one can develop the mode of ignorance and defeat goodness and passion although there are these three modes of material nature if one is determined he can be blessed by the mode of goodness and by transcending the mode of goodness he can be situated in pure goodness

down again this is incorrect according to this verse if one develops the mode of ignorance after his death he is degraded to an animal form of life from there one has to again elevate himself by an

in happiness but activities in the mode of passion are simply miserable any activity for material happiness is bound to be defeated if for example one wants to have a skyscraper so much human misery has to be undergone before a big skyscraper can be built the financier has to take much trouble to earn a mass of wealth and those who are slaving to construct the building have to render physical toil the miseries are there thus bhagavadgt says that in any activity performed under the spell of the mode of passion there is definitely great misery there may be a little socalled mental happinessi have this house or this moneybut this is not actual happiness as far as the mode of ignorance is concerned the performer is without knowledge and therefore all his activities result in present misery and afterwards he will go on toward animal life animal life is always miserable although under the spell of the illusory energy my the animals do not understand this slaughtering poor animals is also due to the mode of ignorance the animal killers do not know that in the future the animal will copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved have a body suitable to kill them that is the law of nature in human society if one kills a man he has to be hanged that is the law of the state because of ignorance people do not perceive that there is a complete state controlled by the supreme lord every living creature is a son of the supreme lord and he does not tolerate even an ants being killed one has to pay for it so indulgence in animal killing for the taste of the tongue is the grossest kind of ignorance a human being has no need to kill animals because god has supplied so many nice things if one indulges in meateating anyway it is to be understood that he is acting in ignorance and is making his future very dark of all kinds of animal killing the killing of cows is most vicious because the cow gives us all kinds of pleasure by supplying milk cow slaughter is an act of the grossest type of ignorance in the vedic literature g veda 9464 the words gobhi pritamatsaram indicate that one who being fully satisfied by milk is desirous of killing the cow is in the grossest ignorance there is also a prayer in the vedic literature that states namo brahmayadevya gobrhmaahitya ca jagaddhitya kya govindya namo nama my lord you are the wellwisher of the cows and the brhmaas and you are the wellwisher of the entire human society and world viu pura 11965 the purport is that special mention is given in that prayer for the protection of the cows and the brhmaas brhmaas are the symbol of spiritual education and cows are the symbol of the most valuable food these two living creatures the brhmaas and the cows must be given all protectionthat is real advancement of civilization in modern human society spiritual knowledge is neglected and cow killing is encouraged it is to be understood then that human society is advancing in the wrong direction and is clearing the path to its own condemnation a civilization which guides the citizens to become animals in their next lives is certainly not a human civilization the present human civilization is of

cannot see things clearly in the mode of ignorance for example copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved they do not see that by killing one animal they are taking the chance of being killed by the same animal in the next life because people have no education in actual knowledge they become irresponsible to stop this irresponsibility education for developing the mode of goodness of the people in general must be there when they are actually educated in the mode of goodness they will become sober in full knowledge of things as they are then people will be happy and prosperous even if the majority of the people arent happy and prosperous if a certain percentage of the population develops ka consciousness and becomes situated in the mode of goodness then there is the possibility for peace and prosperity all over the world otherwise if the world is devoted to the modes of passion and ignorance there can be no peace or prosperity in the mode of passion people become greedy and their hankering for sense enjoyment has no limit one can see that even if one has enough money and adequate arrangements for sense gratification there is neither happiness nor peace of mind that is not possible because one is situated in the mode of passion if one wants happiness at all his money will not help him he has to elevate himself to the mode of goodness by practicing ka consciousness when one is engaged in the mode of passion not only is he mentally unhappy but his profession and occupation are also very troublesome he has to devise so many plans and schemes to acquire enough money to maintain his status quo this is all miserable in the mode of ignorance people become mad being distressed by their circumstances they take shelter of intoxication and thus they

translation those situated in the mode of goodness gradually go upward to the higher planets those in the mode of passion live on the earthly planets and those in the abominable mode of ignorance go down to the hellish worlds purport in this verse the results of actions in the three modes of nature are more explicitly set forth there is an upper planetary system consisting of the heavenly planets where everyone is highly elevated according to the degree of development of the mode of goodness the living entity can be transferred to various planets in this system the highest planet is satyaloka or brahmaloka where the prime person of this universe lord brahm resides we have seen already that we can hardly calculate the wondrous condition of life in brahmaloka but the highest condition of life the mode of goodness can bring us to this the mode of passion is mixed it is in the middle between the modes of goodness and ignorance a person is not always pure but even if he should be purely in the mode of passion he will simply remain on this earth as a king or a rich man but because there are mixtures one can also go down people on this earth in the mode of passion or ignorance cannot forcibly approach the higher planets by machine in the mode of passion there is also the chance of becoming mad in the next life copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved the lowest quality the mode of ignorance is described here as abominable the result of developing ignorance is very very risky it is the lowest quality in material nature beneath the human level there are eight million species of lifebirds beasts reptiles trees etcand according to the development of the mode of ignorance people are brought down to these abominable conditions the word tmas is very significant here tmas indicates those who stay continuously in the mode of ignorance without rising to a higher mode their future is very dark there is an opportunity for men in the modes of ignorance and passion to be elevated to the mode of goodness and that system is called ka consciousness but one who does not take advantage of this opportunity will certainly continue in the lower modes text 19

by learning from the proper souls the real spiritual master is ka and he is imparting this spiritual knowledge to arjuna similarly it is from those who are fully in ka consciousness that one has to learn this science of activities in terms of the modes of nature otherwise ones life will be misdirected by the instruction of a bona fide spiritual master a living entity can know of his spiritual position his material body his senses how he is entrapped and how he is under the spell of the material modes of nature he is helpless being in the grip of these modes but when he can see his real position then he can attain to the transcendental platform having the scope for spiritual life actually the living entity is not the performer of different activities he is forced to act because he is situated in a particular type of body conducted by some particular mode of material nature unless one has the help of spiritual authority he cannot understand in what position he is actually situated with the association of a bona fide spiritual master he can see his real position and by such an understanding he can become fixed in full ka consciousness a man in ka consciousness is not controlled by the spell of the material modes of nature it has already been stated in the seventh chapter that one who has surrendered to ka is relieved from the activities of material nature for one who is able

spiritual knowledge he can be free from the influence of the modes of nature he can enjoy the happiness of spiritual life even in this body because after leaving this body he is certainly going to the spiritual sky but even in this body he can enjoy spiritual happiness in other words devotional service in ka consciousness is the sign of liberation from material entanglement and this will be

and distress who looks upon a lump of earth a stone and a piece of gold with an equal eye who is equal toward the desirable and the undesirable who is steady situated equally well in praise and blame honor and dishonor who treats alike both friend and enemy and who has renounced all material activitiessuch a person is said to have transcended the modes of nature copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved purport arjuna submitted three different questions and the lord answers them one after another in these verses ka first indicates that a person transcendentally situated has no envy and does not hanker for anything when a living entity stays in this material world embodied by the material body it is to be understood that he is under the control of one of the three modes of material nature when he is actually out of the body then he is out of the clutches of the material modes of nature but as long as he is not out of the material body he should be neutral he should engage himself in the devotional service of the lord so that his identity with the material body will automatically be forgotten when one is conscious of the material body he acts only for sense gratification but when one transfers the consciousness to ka sense gratification automatically stops one does not need this material body and he does not need to accept the dictations of the material body the qualities of the material modes in the body will act but as spirit soul the self is aloof from such activities how does he become aloof he does not desire to enjoy the body nor does he desire to get out of it thus transcendentally situated the devotee becomes automatically free he need not try to become free from the influence of the modes of material nature the next question concerns the dealings of a transcendentally situated person the materially situated person is affected by socalled honor and dishonor offered to the body but the transcendentally situated person is not affected by such false honor and dishonor he performs his duty in ka consciousness and does not mind whether a man honors or dishonors him he accepts things that are favorable for his duty in ka consciousness otherwise he has no necessity of anything material either a stone or gold he takes everyone as his dear friend who helps him in his execution of ka consciousness and he does not hate his socalled enemy he is equally disposed and sees everything on an equal level because he knows perfectly well that he has nothing to do with material existence social and political issues do not affect him because he knows the situation of temporary upheavals and disturbances he does not attempt anything for his own sake he can attempt copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved anything for ka but for his personal self he does not attempt anything by such behavior one becomes actually transcendentally situated text 26 maa c yaaevyaiacarea aiyaaegaena saevtae sa

in full devotional service unfailing in all circumstances at once transcends the modes of material nature and thus comes to the level of brahman purport this verse is a reply to arjunas third question what is the means of attaining to the transcendental position as explained before the material world is acting under the spell of the modes of material nature one should not be disturbed by the activities of the modes of nature instead of putting his consciousness into such activities he may transfer his consciousness to ka activities ka activities are known as bhaktiyogaalways acting for ka copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved this includes not only ka but his different plenary expansions such as rma and nryaa he has innumerable expansions one who is engaged in the service of any of the forms of ka or of his plenary expansions is considered to be transcendentally situated one should also note that all the forms of ka are fully transcendental blissful full of knowledge and eternal such personalities of godhead are omnipotent and omniscient and they possess all transcendental qualities so if one engages himself in the service of ka or his plenary expansions with unfailing determination although these modes of material nature are very difficult to overcome one can overcome them easily this has already been explained in the seventh chapter one who surrenders unto ka at once surmounts the influence of the modes of material nature to be in ka consciousness or in devotional service means to acquire equality with ka the lord says that his nature is eternal blissful and full of knowledge and the living entities are part and parcel of the supreme as gold particles are part of a gold mine thus the living entity in his spiritual position is as good as gold as good as ka in quality the difference of individuality continues otherwise there would be no question of bhaktiyoga bhaktiyoga means that the lord is there the devotee is there and the activity of exchange of love between the lord and the devotee is there therefore the individuality of two persons is present in the supreme personality of godhead and the individual person otherwise there would be no meaning to bhaktiyoga if one is not situated in the same transcendental position with the lord one cannot serve the supreme lord to be a personal assistant to a king one must acquire the qualifications thus the qualification is to become brahman or freed from all material contamination it is said in the vedic literature brahmaiva san brahmpy eti one can attain the supreme brahman by becoming brahman this means that one must qualitatively become one with brahman by attainment of brahman one does not lose his eternal brahman identity as an individual soul text 27

the supersoul is the middle the second stage in transcendental realization and the supreme personality of godhead is the ultimate realization of the absolute truth therefore both paramtm and the impersonal brahman are within the supreme person it is explained in the seventh chapter that material nature is the manifestation of the inferior energy of the supreme lord the lord impregnates the inferior material nature with fragments of the superior nature and that is the spiritual touch in the material nature when a living entity conditioned by this material nature begins the cultivation of spiritual knowledge he elevates himself from the position of copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved material existence and gradually rises up to the brahman conception of the supreme this attainment of the brahman conception of life is the first stage in selfrealization at this stage the brahmanrealized person is transcendental to the material position but he is not actually perfect in brahman realization if he wants he can continue to stay in the brahman position and then gradually rise up to paramtm realization and then to the realization of the supreme personality of godhead there are many examples of this in vedic literature the four kumras were situated first in the impersonal brahman conception of truth but then they gradually rose to the platform of devotional service one who cannot elevate himself beyond the impersonal conception of brahman runs the risk of falling down in rmadbhgavatam it is stated that although a person may rise to the stage of impersonal brahman without going further with no information of the supreme person his intelligence is not perfectly clear therefore in spite of being raised to the brahman platform there is the chance of falling down if one is not engaged in the devotional service of the lord in the vedic language it is also said raso vai sa rasa hy evya labdhvnand bhavati when one understands the personality of godhead the reservoir of pleasure ka he actually becomes transcendentally blissful taittirya upaniad 271 the supreme lord is full in six opulences and when a devotee approaches him there is an exchange of these six opulences the servant of the king enjoys on an almost equal level with the king and so eternal happiness imperishable happiness and eternal life accompany devotional service therefore realization of brahman or eternity or imperishability is included in devotional service this is already possessed by a person who is engaged in devotional service the living entity although brahman by nature has the desire to lord it over the material world and due to this he falls down in his constitutional position a living entity is above the three modes of material nature but association with material nature entangles him in the different modes of material naturegoodness passion and ignorance due to the association of these three modes his desire to dominate the material world is there by engagement in devotional service in full ka consciousness he is immediately situated in the transcendental position and his unlawful desire to copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved control material nature is removed therefore the process of devotional service beginning with hearing chanting rememberingthe prescribed nine methods for realizing devotional serviceshould be practiced in the association of devotees gradually by such association by the influence of the spiritual master ones material desire to dominate is removed and one becomes firmly situated in the lords transcendental loving service this method is prescribed from the twentysecond to the last verse of this chapter devotional service to the lord is very simple one should always engage in the service of the lord should eat the remnants of foodstuffs offered to the deity smell the flowers offered to the lotus feet of the lord see the places where the lord had his transcendental pastimes read of the different activities of the lord his reciprocation of love with his devotees chant always the transcendental vibration hare ka hare ka ka ka hare hare hare rma hare rma rma rma hare hare and observe the fasting days commemorating the appearances and disappearances of the lord and his devotees by following such a process one becomes completely detached from all material activities one who can thus situate himself in the brahmajyoti or the different varieties of the brahman conception is equal to the supreme personality of godhead in quality

that there is an imperishable banyan tree that has its roots upward and its branches down and whose leaves are the vedic hymns one who knows this tree is the knower of the vedas purport after the discussion of the importance of bhaktiyoga one may question what about the vedas it is explained in this chapter that the purpose of vedic study is to understand ka therefore one who is in ka consciousness who is engaged in devotional service already knows the vedas the entanglement of this material world is compared here to a banyan tree for one who is engaged in fruitive activities there is no end to the banyan copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved tree he wanders from one branch to another to another to another the tree of this material world has no end and for one who is attached to this tree there is no possibility of liberation the vedic hymns meant for elevating oneself are called the leaves of this tree this trees roots grow upward because they begin from where brahm is located the topmost planet of this universe if one can understand this indestructible tree of illusion then one can get out of it this process of extrication should be understood in the previous chapters it has been explained that there are many processes by which to get out of the material entanglement and up to the thirteenth chapter we have seen that devotional service to the supreme lord is the best way now the basic principle of devotional service is detachment from material activities and attachment to the transcendental service of the lord the process of breaking attachment to the material world is discussed in the beginning of this chapter the root of this material existence grows upward this means that it begins from the total material substance from the topmost planet of the universe from there the whole universe is expanded with so many branches representing the various planetary systems the fruits represent the results of the living entities activities namely religion economic development sense gratification and liberation now there is no ready experience in this world of a tree situated with its branches down and its roots upward but there is such a thing that tree can be found beside a reservoir of water we can see that the trees on the bank reflect upon the water with their branches down and roots up in other words the tree of this material world is only a reflection of the real tree of the spiritual world this reflection of the spiritual world is situated on desire just as a trees reflection is situated on water desire is the cause of things being situated in this reflected material light one who wants to get out of this material existence must know this tree thoroughly through analytical study then he can cut off his relationship with it this tree being the reflection of the real tree is an exact replica everything is there in the spiritual world the impersonalists take brahman to be the root of this material tree and from the root according to skhya copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved philosophy come prakti purua then the three guas then the five gross elements pacamahbhta then the ten senses daendriya mind etc in this way they divide up the whole material world into twentyfour elements if brahman is the center of all manifestations then this material world is a manifestation of the center by 180 degrees and the other 180 degrees constitute the spiritual world the material world is the perverted reflection so the spiritual world must have the same variegatedness but in reality the prakti is the external energy of the supreme lord and the purua is the supreme lord himself and that is explained in bhagavadgt since this manifestation is material it is temporary a reflection is temporary for it is sometimes seen and sometimes not seen but the origin from whence the reflection is reflected is eternal the material reflection of the real tree has to be cut off when it is said that a person knows the vedas it is assumed that he knows how to cut off attachment to this material world if one knows that process he actually knows the vedas one who is attracted by the ritualistic formulas of the vedas is attracted by the beautiful green leaves of the tree he does not exactly know the purpose of the vedas the purpose of the vedas as disclosed by the personality of godhead himself is to cut down this reflected tree and attain the real tree of the spiritual world text 2 adaae pasataastasya xaaa gauapava ivzyapavala ada

is further explained here its branches spread in all directions in the lower parts there are variegated manifestations of living entitieshuman beings animals horses cows dogs cats etc these are situated on the lower parts of the branches whereas on the upper parts are higher forms of living entities the demigods gandharvas and many other higher species of life as a tree is nourished by water so this tree is nourished by the three modes of material nature sometimes we find that a tract of land is barren for want of sufficient water and sometimes a tract is very green similarly where particular modes of material nature are proportionately greater in quantity the different species of life are manifested accordingly the twigs of the tree are considered to be the sense objects by development of the different modes of nature we develop different senses and by the senses we enjoy different varieties of sense objects the tips of the branches are the sensesthe ears nose eyes etcwhich are attached to the enjoyment of different sense objects the twigs are sound form touch and so onthe sense objects the subsidiary roots are attachments and aversions which are byproducts of different varieties of suffering and sense enjoyment the tendencies toward piety and impiety are considered to develop from these secondary roots which spread in all directions the real root is from copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved brahmaloka and the other roots are in the human planetary systems after one enjoys the results of virtuous activities in the upper planetary systems he comes down to this earth and renews his karma or fruitive activities for promotion this planet of human beings is considered the field of activities texts 34 na pamasyaeh

ends where it begins or where its foundation is but with determination one must cut down this strongly rooted tree with the weapon of detachment thereafter one must seek that place from which having gone one never returns and there surrender to that supreme personality of godhead from whom everything began and from whom everything has extended since time immemorial purport it is now clearly stated that the real form of this banyan tree cannot be understood in this material world since the root is upwards the extension of the real tree is at the other end when entangled with the material expansions of the tree one cannot see how far the tree extends nor can one see the beginning of this tree yet one has to find out the cause i am the son of my father my father is the son of suchandsuch a person etc by searching in this way one comes to brahm who is generated by the garbhodakay viu finally in this way when one reaches the supreme personality of godhead that is the end of research work one has to search out that origin of this tree the supreme personality of godhead through the association of persons who are in knowledge of that supreme personality of godhead then by understanding one becomes gradually detached from this false reflection of reality and by knowledge one can cut off the connection and actually become situated in the real tree the word asaga is very important in this connection because the attachment for sense enjoyment and lording it over the material nature is very strong therefore one must learn detachment by discussion of spiritual science based on authoritative scriptures and one must hear from persons who are actually in knowledge as a result of such discussion in the association of devotees one comes to the supreme personality of godhead then the first copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved thing one must do is surrender to him the description of that place whence having gone one never returns to this false reflected tree is given here the supreme personality of godhead ka is the original root from whom everything has emanated to gain favor of that personality of godhead one has only to surrender and this is a result of performing devotional service by hearing chanting etc he is the cause of the extension of the material world this has already been explained by the lord himself aha sarvasya prabhava i am the origin of everything therefore to get out of the entanglement of this strong banyan tree of material life one must surrender to ka as soon as one surrenders unto ka one becomes detached automatically from this material extension text 5 inamaarnamaaeha ijatasadaeza adyaatmainatyaa ivinavtakamaa neivrmaua saudusaje garcntyamaua padmavyaya tata 5 nirmnamoh jitasagado

understand the eternal who are done with material lust who are freed from the dualities of happiness and distress and who unbewildered know how to surrender unto the supreme person attain to that eternal kingdom purport the surrendering process is described here very nicely the first qualification is that one should not be deluded by pride because the conditioned soul is puffed up thinking himself the lord of material nature it is very difficult for him to surrender unto the supreme personality of godhead one should know by the cultivation of real knowledge that he is not lord of material nature the supreme personality of godhead is the lord when one is free from delusion caused by pride he can begin the process of surrender for one who is always expecting some honor in this material world it is not possible to surrender to the supreme person pride is due to illusion for although one comes here stays for a brief time and then goes away he has the foolish notion that he is the lord of the world he thus makes all things complicated and he is always in trouble the whole world moves under this impression people are considering the land this earth to belong to human society and they have divided the land under the false impression that they are the proprietors one has to get out of this false notion that human society is the proprietor of this world when one is freed from such a false notion he becomes free from all the false associations caused by familial social and national affections these faulty associations bind one to this material world after this stage one has to develop spiritual knowledge one has to cultivate knowledge of what is actually his own and what is actually not his own and when one has an understanding of things as they are he becomes free from all dual conceptions such as happiness and distress pleasure and pain he becomes full in knowledge then it is possible for him to surrender to the supreme personality of godhead text 6

electricity because all the planets are selfluminous we have only one planet in this universe the sun which is selfluminous but all the planets in the spiritual sky are selfluminous the shining effulgence of all those planets called vaikuhas constitutes the shining sky known as the brahmajyoti actually the effulgence is emanating from the planet of ka goloka vndvana part of that shining effulgence is covered by the mahattattva the material world other than this the major portion of that shining sky is full of spiritual planets which are called vaikuhas chief of which is goloka vndvana as long as a living entity is in this dark material world he is in conditional copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved life but as soon as he reaches the spiritual sky by cutting through the false perverted tree of this material world he becomes liberated then there is no chance of his coming back here in his conditional life the living entity considers himself to be the lord of this material world but in his liberated state he enters into the spiritual kingdom and becomes an associate of the supreme lord there he enjoys eternal bliss eternal life and full knowledge one should be captivated by this information he should desire to transfer himself to that eternal world and extricate himself from this false reflection of reality for one who is too much attached to this material world it is very difficult to cut that attachment but if he takes to ka consciousness there is a chance of gradually becoming detached one has to associate himself with devotees those who are in ka consciousness one should search out a society dedicated to ka consciousness and learn how to discharge devotional service in this way he can cut off his attachment to the material world one cannot become detached from the attraction of the material world simply by dressing himself in saffron cloth he must become attached to the devotional service of the lord therefore one should take it very seriously that devotional service as described in the twelfth chapter is the only way to get out of this false representation of the real tree in chapter fourteen the contamination of all kinds of processes by material nature is described only devotional service is described as purely transcendental the words parama mama are very important here actually every nook and corner is the property of the supreme lord but the spiritual world is paramam full of six opulences the kaha upaniad 2215 also confirms that in the spiritual world there is no need of sunshine moonshine or stars na tatra sryo bhti na candratrakam for the whole spiritual sky is illuminated by the internal potency of the supreme lord that supreme abode can be achieved only by surrender and by

part and parcel of the supreme lordeternally it is not that he assumes individuality in his conditional life and in his liberated state becomes one with the supreme lord he is eternally fragmented it is clearly said santana according to the vedic version the supreme lord manifests and expands himself in innumerable expansions of which the primary expansions are called viutattva and the secondary expansions are called the living entities in other words the viutattva is the personal expansion and the living entities are the separated expansions by his personal expansion he is manifested in various forms like lord rma nsihadeva viumrti and all the predominating deities in the vaikuha copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved planets the separated expansions the living entities are eternally servitors the personal expansions of the supreme personality of godhead the individual identities of the godhead are always present similarly the separated expansions of living entities have their identities as fragmental parts and parcels of the supreme lord the living entities also have fragmental portions of his qualities of which independence is one every living entity as an individual soul has his personal individuality and a minute form of independence by misuse of that independence one becomes a conditioned soul and by proper use of independence he is always liberated in either case he is qualitatively eternal as the supreme lord is in his liberated state he is freed from this material condition and he is under the engagement of transcendental service unto the lord in his conditioned life he is dominated by the material modes of nature and he forgets the transcendental loving service of the lord as a result he has to struggle very hard to maintain his existence in the material world the living entities not only human beings and the cats and dogs but even the greater controllers of the material worldbrahm lord iva and even viuare all parts and parcels of the supreme lord they are all eternal not temporary manifestations the word karati struggling or grappling hard is very significant the conditioned soul is bound up as though shackled by iron chains he is bound up by the false ego and the mind is the chief agent which is driving him in this material existence when the mind is in the mode of goodness his activities are good when the mind is in the mode of passion his activities are troublesome and when the mind is in the mode of ignorance he travels in the lower species of life it is clear however in this verse that the conditioned soul is covered by the material body with the mind and the senses and when he is liberated this material covering perishes but his spiritual body manifests itself in its individual capacity the following information is there in the mdhyandinyanaruti sa v ea brahmaniha ida arra martyam atisjya brahmbhisampadya brahma payati brahma oti brahmaaiveda sarvam anubhavati it is stated here that when a living entity gives up this material embodiment and enters into the spiritual world he revives his spiritual body and in his spiritual body he can see the supreme copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved personality of godhead face to face he can hear and speak to him face to face and he can understand the supreme personality as he is from smti also it is understood vasanti yatra puru sarve vaikuhamrtaya in the spiritual planets everyone lives in bodies featured like the supreme personality of godheads as far as bodily construction is concerned there is no difference between the partandparcel living entities and the expansions of viumrti in other words at liberation the living entity gets a spiritual body by the grace of the supreme personality of godhead the words mamaiva fragmental parts and parcels of the supreme lord are also very significant the fragmental portion of the supreme lord is not like some material broken part we have already understood in the second chapter that the spirit cannot be cut into pieces this fragment is not materially conceived it is not like matter which can be cut into pieces and joined together again that conception is not applicable here because the sanskrit word santana eternal is used the fragmental portion is eternal it is also stated in the beginning of the second chapter that in each and every individual body the fragmental portion of the supreme lord is present dehino smin yath dehe that fragmental portion when liberated from the bodily entanglement revives its original spiritual body in the spiritual sky in a spiritual planet and enjoys association with the supreme lord it is however understood here that the living entity being the fragmental part and parcel of the supreme lord is qualitatively one with the lord just as the parts and parcels of gold are also gold text 8 xarqr yadvapanaeita yaapyautamataqr gahqtvetaaina sayaaita vayaugarndaainavaxayaata 8 arra yad

the controller of his own body if he likes he can change his body to a higher grade and if he likes he can move to a lower class minute independence is there the change his body undergoes depends upon him at the time of death the consciousness he has created will carry him on to the next type of body if he has made his consciousness like that of a cat or dog he is sure to change to a cats or dogs body and if he has fixed his consciousness on godly qualities he will change into the form of a demigod and if he is in ka consciousness he will be transferred to kaloka in the spiritual world and will associate with ka it is a false claim that after the annihilation of this body everything is finished the individual soul is transmigrating from one body to another and his present body and present activities are the background of his next body one gets a different body according to karma and he has to quit this body in due course it is stated here that the subtle body which carries the conception of the next body develops another body in the next life this process of transmigrating from one body to another and struggling while in the body is called karati or struggle for existence

enjoying under certain circumstances under the spell of material nature as a result he is suffering different kinds of happiness and distress under the illusion of sense enjoyment persons who are everlastingly fooled by lust and desire lose all power to understand their change of body and their stay in a particular body they cannot comprehend it those who have developed spiritual knowledge however can see that the spirit is different from the body and is changing its body and enjoying in different ways a person in such knowledge can understand how the conditioned living entity is suffering in this material existence therefore those who are highly developed in ka consciousness try their best to give this knowledge to the people in general for their conditional life is very much

suns moons and planets also but in each universe there is only one sun as stated in bhagavadgt 1021 the moon is one of the stars nakatrm aha a sunlight is due to the spiritual effulgence in the

and even into the atom so due to his entrance everything is appropriately manifested when the spirit soul is there a living man can float on the water but when the living spark is out of the body and the body is dead the body sinks of course when it is decomposed it floats just like straw and other things but as soon as the man is dead he at once sinks in the water similarly all these planets are floating in space and this is due to the entrance of the supreme energy of the supreme personality of godhead his energy is sustaining each planet just like a handful of dust if someone holds a handful of dust there is no possibility of the dusts falling but if one throws it in the air it will fall down similarly these planets which are floating in the air are actually held in the fist of the universal form of the supreme lord by his strength and energy all moving and nonmoving things stay in their place it is said in the vedic hymns that because of the supreme personality of godhead the sun is shining and the planets are steadily moving were it not for him all the planets would scatter like dust in air and perish similarly it is due to the supreme personality of godhead that the moon nourishes all vegetables due to the moons influence the vegetables become delicious without the moonshine the vegetables can neither grow nor taste succulent human society is working living comfortably and enjoying food due to the supply from the supreme lord otherwise mankind could not survive the word rastmaka is very significant everything becomes palatable by the agency of the

intl all rights reserved the supreme lord is situated as paramtm in everyones heart and it is from him that all activities are initiated the living entity forgets everything of his past life but he has to act according to the direction of the supreme lord who is witness to all his work therefore he begins his work according to his past deeds required knowledge is supplied to him and remembrance is given to him and he forgets also about his past life thus the lord is not only allpervading he is also localized in every individual heart he awards the different fruitive results he is worshipable not only as the impersonal brahman the supreme personality of godhead and the localized paramtm but as the form of the incarnation of the vedas as well the vedas give the right direction to people so that they can properly mold their lives and come back to godhead back to home the vedas offer knowledge of the supreme personality of godhead ka and ka in his incarnation as vysadeva is the compiler of the vedntastra the commentation on the vedntastra by vysadeva in the rmadbhgavatam gives the real understanding of vedntastra the supreme lord is so full that for the deliverance of the conditioned soul he is the supplier and digester of foodstuff the witness of his activity and the giver of knowledge in the form of vedas and as the supreme personality of godhead r ka the teacher of the

again initiated by the supreme lord although he forgets the lord gives him the intelligence to renew his work where he ended his last life so not only does a living entity enjoy or suffer in this world according to the dictation from the supreme lord situated locally in the heart but he receives the opportunity to understand the vedas from him if one is serious about understanding the vedic knowledge then ka gives the required intelligence why does he present the vedic knowledge for understanding because a living entity individually needs to understand ka vedic literature confirms this yo sau sarvair vedair gyate in all vedic literature beginning from the four vedas vedntastra and the upaniads and puras the glories of the supreme lord are celebrated by performance of vedic rituals discussion of the vedic philosophy and worship of the lord in copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved devotional service he is attained therefore the purpose of the vedas is to understand ka the vedas give us direction by which to understand ka and the process of realizing him the ultimate goal is the supreme personality of godhead vedntastra 114 confirms this in the following words tat tu samanvayt one can attain perfection in three stages by understanding vedic literature one can understand his relationship with the supreme personality of godhead by performing the different processes one can approach him and at the end one can attain the supreme goal who is no other than the supreme personality of godhead in this verse the purpose of the vedas the

world every living entity is called infallible copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved purport as already explained the lord in his incarnation as vysadeva compiled the vedntastra here the lord is giving in summary the contents of the vedntastra he says that the living entities who are innumerable can be divided into two classesthe fallible and the infallible the living entities are eternally separated parts and parcels of the supreme personality of godhead when they are in contact with the material world they are called jvabhta and the sanskrit words given here kara sarvi bhtni mean that they are fallible those who are in oneness with the supreme personality of godhead however are called infallible oneness does not mean that they have no individuality but that there is no disunity they are all agreeable to the purpose of the creation of course in the spiritual world there is no such thing as creation but since the supreme personality of godhead as stated in the vedntastra is the source of all emanations that conception is explained according to the statement of the supreme personality of godhead lord ka there are two classes of living entities the vedas give evidence of this so there is no doubt about it the living entities who are struggling in this world with the mind and five senses have their material bodies which are changing as long as a living entity is conditioned his body changes due to contact with matter matter is changing so the living entity appears to be changing but in the spiritual world the body is not made of matter therefore there is no change in the material world the living entity undergoes six changesbirth growth duration reproduction then dwindling and vanishing these are the changes of the material body but in the spiritual world the body does not change there is no old age there is no birth there is no death there all exists in oneness kara sarvi bhtni any living entity who has come in contact with matter beginning from the first created being brahm down to a small ant is changing its body therefore they are all fallible in the spiritual world however they are always liberated in oneness text 17

soul he is therefore the greatest of personalities now it is clear here that the living entities and the supreme personality of godhead are individuals the difference is that the living entities either in the conditioned state or in the liberated state cannot surpass in quantity the inconceivable potencies of the supreme personality of godhead it is incorrect to think of the supreme lord and the living entities copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved as being on the same level or equal in all respects there is always the question of superiority and inferiority

constitutional position of the living entities and the supreme absolute truth now in this verse the supreme personality of godhead clearly explains that anyone who knows lord ka to be the supreme person is actually the knower of everything the imperfect knower goes on simply speculating about the absolute truth but the perfect knower without wasting his valuable time engages directly in ka consciousness the devotional service of the supreme lord throughout the whole of bhagavadgt this fact is being stressed at every step and still there are so many stubborn commentators on bhagavadgt who consider the supreme absolute truth and the living entities to be one and the same vedic knowledge is called ruti learning by aural reception one should actually receive the vedic message from authorities like ka and his representatives here ka distinguishes everything very nicely and one should hear from this source simply to hear like the hogs is not sufficient one must be able to understand from the authorities it is not that one should simply speculate academically one should submissively hear from bhagavadgt that these living entities are always subordinate to the supreme personality of godhead anyone who is able to understand this according to the supreme personality of godhead r ka knows the purpose of the vedas no one else knows the purpose of the vedas the word bhajati is very significant in many places the word bhajati is expressed in relationship with the service of the supreme lord if a person is copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved engaged in full ka consciousness in the devotional service of the lord it is to be understood that he has understood all the vedic knowledge in the vaiava parampar it is said that if one is engaged in the devotional service of ka then there is no need for any other spiritual process for understanding the supreme absolute truth he has already come to the point because he is engaged in the devotional service of the lord he has ended all preliminary processes of understanding but if anyone after speculating for hundreds of thousands of lives does not come to the point that ka is the supreme personality of godhead and that one has to surrender there all his speculation for so many years and lives is a useless waste of time text 20 wita gautama xaaimadmau mayaanaga wtadbuda

supreme personality of godhead thus one will become intelligent and perfect in transcendental knowledge in other words by understanding this philosophy of the supreme personality of godhead and engaging in his transcendental service everyone can become freed from all contaminations of the modes of material nature devotional service is a process of spiritual understanding wherever devotional service exists the material contamination cannot coexist devotional service to the lord and the lord himself are one and the same because they are spiritual devotional service takes place within the internal energy of the supreme lord the lord is said to be the sun and ignorance is called darkness where the sun is present there is no question of darkness therefore whenever devotional service is present under the proper guidance of a bona fide spiritual master there is no question of ignorance everyone must take to this consciousness of ka and engage in devotional service to become intelligent and purified unless one comes to this position of understanding ka and engages in devotional service however intelligent he may be in the estimation of some common man he is not perfectly intelligent the word anagha by which arjuna is addressed is significant anagha o sinless one means that unless one is free from all sinful reactions it is very difficult to understand ka one has to become free from all contamination all sinful activities then he can understand but devotional service is so pure and potent that once one is engaged in devotional service he automatically comes to the stage of sinlessness while one is performing devotional service in the association of pure devotees in full ka consciousness there are certain things which require to be vanquished altogether the most important thing one has to surmount is weakness of the heart the first falldown is caused by the desire to lord it over material nature thus one gives up the transcendental loving service of the supreme lord the second weakness of the heart is that as one increases the propensity to lord it over material nature he becomes attached to matter and copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl

endowed with divine nature purport in the beginning of the fifteenth chapter the banyan tree of this material world was explained the extra roots coming out of it were compared to the activities of the living entities some auspicious some inauspicious in the ninth chapter also the devas or godly and the asuras the ungodly or demons were explained now according to vedic rites activities in the mode of goodness are considered auspicious for progress on the path of liberation and such activities are known as daiv prakti transcendental by nature those who are situated in the transcendental nature make progress on the path of liberation for those who are acting in the modes of passion and ignorance on the other hand there is no possibility of liberation either they will have to remain in this material world as human beings or they will descend among the species of animals or even lower life forms in this sixteenth chapter the lord explains both the transcendental nature and its attendant qualities and the demoniac nature and its qualities he also explains the advantages and disadvantages of these qualities the word abhijtasya in reference to one born of transcendental qualities or godly tendencies is very significant to beget a child in a godly atmosphere is known in the vedic scriptures as garbhdhnasaskra if the parents want a child in the godly qualities they should follow the ten principles recommended for the social life of the human being in bhagavadgt we have studied also before that sex life for begetting a good child is ka himself sex life is not condemned provided the process is used in ka consciousness those who are in ka consciousness at least should not beget children like cats and dogs but should beget them so that they may become ka conscious after birth that should be the advantage of children born of a father and copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved mother absorbed in ka consciousness the social institution known as varramadharmathe institution dividing society into four divisions of social life and four occupational divisions or castesis not meant to divide human society according to birth such divisions are in terms of educational qualifications they are to keep the society in a state of peace and prosperity the qualities mentioned herein are explained as transcendental qualities meant for making a person progress in spiritual understanding so that he can get liberated from the material world in the varrama institution the sannys or the person in the renounced order of life is considered to be the head or the spiritual master of all the social statuses and orders a brhmaa is considered to be the spiritual master of the three other sections of a society namely the katriyas the vaiyas and the dras but a sannys who is on the top of the institution is considered to be the spiritual master of the brhmaas also for a sannys the first qualification should be fearlessness because a sannys has to be alone without any support or guarantee of support he has simply to depend on the mercy of the supreme personality of godhead if one thinks after i leave my connections who will protect me he should not accept the renounced order of life one must be fully convinced that ka or the supreme personality of godhead in his localized aspect as paramtm is always within that he is seeing everything and he always knows what one intends to do one must thus have firm conviction that ka as paramtm will take care of a soul surrendered to him i shall never be alone one should think even if i live in the darkest regions of a forest i shall be accompanied by ka and he will give me all protection that conviction is called abhayam fearlessness this state of mind is necessary for a person in the renounced order of life then he has to purify his existence there are so many rules and regulations to be followed in the renounced order of life most important of all a sannys is strictly forbidden to have any intimate relationship with a woman he is even forbidden to talk with a woman in a secluded place lord caitanya was an ideal sannys and when he was at pur his feminine devotees could not even come near to offer their respects they were advised to bow down from a distant place this is not a sign of hatred for women as a copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved class but it is a stricture imposed on the sannys not to have close connections with women one has to follow the rules and regulations of a particular status of life in order to purify his existence for a sannys intimate relations with women and possession of wealth for sense gratification are strictly forbidden the ideal sannys was lord caitanya himself and we can learn from his life that he was very strict in regards to women although he is considered to be the most liberal incarnation of godhead accepting the most fallen conditioned souls he strictly followed the rules and regulations of the sannysa order of life in connection with association with woman one of his personal associates namely choa haridsa was associated with lord caitanya along with his other confidential personal associates but somehow or other this choa haridsa looked lustily on a young woman and lord caitanya was so strict that he at once rejected him from the society of his personal associates lord caitanya said for a sannys or anyone who is aspiring to get out of the clutches of material nature and trying to elevate himself to the spiritual nature and go back home back to godhead for him looking toward material possessions and women for sense gratificationnot even enjoying them but just looking toward them with such a propensityis so condemned that he had better commit suicide before experiencing such illicit desires so these are the processes for purification the next item is jnayogavyavasthiti being engaged in the cultivation of knowledge sannys life is meant for distributing knowledge to the householders and others who have forgotten their real life of spiritual advancement a sannys is supposed to beg from door to door for his livelihood but this does not mean that he is a beggar humility is also one of the qualifications of a transcendentally situated person and out of sheer humility the sannys goes from door to door not exactly for the purpose of begging but to see the householders and awaken them to ka consciousness this is the duty of a sannys if he is actually advanced and so ordered by his spiritual master he should preach ka consciousness with logic and understanding and if one is not so advanced he should not accept the renounced order of life but even if one has accepted the renounced order of life without sufficient knowledge he should engage himself fully in hearing copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved from a bona fide spiritual master to cultivate knowledge a sannys or one in the renounced order of life must be situated in fearlessness sattvasauddhi purity and jnayoga knowledge the next item is charity charity is meant for the householders the householders should earn a livelihood by an honorable means and spend fifty percent of their income to propagate ka consciousness all over the world thus a householder should give in charity to institutional societies that are engaged in that way charity should be given to the right receiver there are different kinds of charity as will be explained later oncharity in the modes of goodness passion and ignorance charity in the mode of goodness is recommended by the scriptures but charity in the modes of passion and ignorance is not recommended because it is simply a waste of money charity should be given only to propagate ka consciousness all over the world that is charity in the mode of goodness then as far as dama selfcontrol is concerned it is not only meant for other orders of religious society but is especially meant for the householder although he has a wife a householder should not use his senses for sex life unnecessarily there are restrictions for the householders even in sex life which should only be engaged in for the propagation of children if he does not require children he should not enjoy sex life with his wife modern society enjoys sex life with contraceptive methods or more abominable methods to avoid the responsibility of children this is not in the transcendental quality but is demoniac if anyone even if he is a householder wants to make progress in spiritual life he must control his sex life and should not beget a child without the purpose of serving ka if he is able to beget children who will be in ka consciousness one can produce hundreds of children but without this capacity one should not indulge only for sense pleasure sacrifice is another item to be performed by the householders because sacrifices require a large amount of money those in other orders of life namely brahmacarya vnaprastha and sannysa have no money they live by begging so performance of different types of sacrifice is meant for the householders they should perform agnihotra sacrifices as enjoined in the vedic literature but such sacrifices at the present moment are very expensive copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved and it is not possible for any householder to perform them the best sacrifice recommended in this age is called sakrtanayaja this sakrtanayaja the chanting of hare ka hare ka ka ka hare hare hare rma hare rma rma rma hare hare is the best and most inexpensive sacrifice everyone can adopt it and derive benefit so these three items namely charity sense control and performance of sacrifice are meant for the householder then svdhyya vedic study is meant for brahmacarya or student life brahmacrs should have no connection with women they should live a life of celibacy and engage the mind in the study of vedic literature for cultivation of spiritual knowledge this is called svdhyya tapas or austerity is especially meant for the retired life one should not remain a householder throughout his whole life he must always remember that there are four divisions of lifebrahmacarya ghastha vnaprastha and sannysa so after ghastha householder life one should retire if one lives for a hundred years he should spend twentyfive years in student life twentyfive in householder life twentyfive in retired life and twentyfive in the renounced order of life these are the regulations of the vedic religious discipline a man retired from household life must practice austerities of the body mind and tongue that is tapasya the entire varramadharma society is meant for tapasya without tapasya or austerity no human being can get liberation the theory that there is no need of austerity in life that one can go on speculating and everything will be nice is recommended neither in the vedic literature nor in bhagavadgt such theories are manufactured by showbottle spiritualists who are trying to gather more followers if there are restrictions rules and regulations people will not become attracted therefore those who want followers in the name of religion just to have a show only dont restrict the lives of their students nor their own lives but that method is not approved by the vedas as far as the brahminical quality of simplicity is concerned not only should a particular order of life follow this principle but every member be he in the brahmacr rama ghastha rama vnaprastha rama or sannysa rama one should be very simple and straightforward copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved ahis means not arresting the progressive life of any living entity one should not think that since the spirit spark is never killed even after the killing of the body there is no harm in killing animals for sense gratification people are now addicted to eating animals in spite of having an ample supply of grains fruits and milk there is no necessity for animal killing this injunction is for everyone when there is no alternative one may kill an animal but it should be offered in sacrifice at any rate when there is an ample food supply for humanity persons who are desiring to make advancement in spiritual realization should not commit violence to animals real ahis means not checking anyones progressive life the animals are also making progress in their evolutionary life by transmigrating from one category of animal life to another if a particular animal is killed then his progress is checked if an animal is staying in a particular body for so many days or so many years and is untimely killed then he has to come back again in that form of life to complete the remaining days in order to be promoted to another species of life so their progress should not be checked simply to satisfy ones palate this is called ahis satyam this word means that one should not distort the truth for some personal interest in vedic literature there are some difficult passages but the meaning or the purpose should be learned from a bona fide spiritual master that is the process for understanding the vedas ruti means that one should hear from the authority one should not construe some interpretation for his personal interest there are so many commentaries on bhagavadgt that misinterpret the original text the real import of the word should be presented and that should be learned from a bona fide spiritual master akrodha means to check anger even if there is provocation one should be tolerant for once one becomes angry his whole body becomes polluted anger is a product of the mode of passion and lust so one who is transcendentally situated should check himself from anger apaiunam means that one should not find fault with others or correct them unnecessarily of course to call a thief a thief is not faultfinding but to call an honest person a thief is very much offensive for one who is making advancement in spiritual life hr means that one should be very modest and must not perform some act which is copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved abominable acpalam determination means that one should not be agitated or frustrated in some attempt there may be failure in some attempt but one should not be sorry for that he should make progress with patience and determination the word tejas used here is meant for the katriyas the katriyas should always be very strong to be able to give protection to the weak they should not pose themselves as nonviolent if violence is required they must exhibit it but a person who is able to curb down his enemy may under certain conditions show forgiveness he may excuse minor offenses aucam means cleanliness not only in mind and body but in ones dealings also it is especially meant for the mercantile people who should not deal in the black market ntimnit not expecting honor applies to the dras the worker class which are considered according to vedic injunctions to be the lowest of the four classes they should not be puffed up with unnecessary prestige or honor and should remain in their own status it is the duty of the dras to offer respect to the higher class for the upkeep of the social order all these twentysix qualifications mentioned are transcendental qualities they should be cultivated according to the different statuses of social and occupational order the purport is that even though material conditions are miserable if these qualities are developed by practice by all classes of men then gradually it is possible to rise to the highest platform of transcendental realization text 4 dmaae dpaaeriamaana aeda paazyamaev c ajana caiajaatasya paaqar

want to make a show of religion and advancement in spiritual science although they do not follow the principles they are always arrogant or proud in possessing some type of education or so much wealth they desire to be worshiped by others and demand respectability although they do not command respect over trifles they become very angry and speak harshly not gently they do not know what should be done and what should not be done they do everything whimsically according to their own desire and they do not recognize any authority these demoniac qualities are taken on by them from the beginning

arrows at the enemy is considered transcendental and refraining from such a duty is demoniac therefore there was no cause for arjuna to lament anyone who performs the regulative principles of the

not follow the regulative principles as they are laid down in the scriptures and who acts according to his whims is called demoniac or asuric there is no other criterion but obedience to the

especially among the ryans those who adopt the vedic civilization and who are known as the most advanced civilized peoples those who do not follow the scriptural injunctions are supposed to be demons therefore it is stated here that the demons do not know the scriptural rules nor do they have any inclination to follow them most of them do not know them and even if some of them know they have not the tendency to follow them they have no faith nor are they willing to act in terms of the vedic injunctions the demons are not clean either externally or internally one should always be careful to keep his body clean copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved by bathing brushing teeth shaving changing clothes etc as far as internal cleanliness is concerned one should always remember the holy names of god and chant hare ka hare ka ka ka hare hare hare rma hare rma rma rma hare hare the demons neither like nor follow all these rules for external and internal cleanliness as for behavior there are many rules and regulations guiding human behavior such as the manusahit which is the law of the human race even up to today those who are hindu follow the manusahit laws of inheritance and other legalities are derived from this book now in the manusahit it is clearly stated that a woman should not be given freedom that does not mean that women are to be kept as slaves but they are like children children are not given freedom but that does not mean that they are kept as slaves the demons have now neglected such injunctions and they think that women should be given as much freedom as men however this has not improved the social condition of the world actually a woman should be given protection at every stage of life she should be given protection by the father in her younger days by the husband in her youth and by the grownup sons in her old age this is proper social behavior according to the manusahit but modern education has artificially devised a puffedup concept of womanly life and therefore marriage is practically now an imagination in human society nor is the moral condition of woman very good now the demons therefore do not accept any instruction which is good for society and because they do not follow the experience of great sages and the rules and regulations laid down by the sages the social condition of the demoniac people is very miserable text 8 asatyamapaita tae jagadahurnaqrma aparsparsamauta ikmanyatkamahetaukma 8 asatyam apratiha te jagad hur anvaram copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all

cosmic manifestation arises due to chance material actions and reactions they do not think that the world was created by god for a certain purpose they have their own theory that the world has come about in its own way and that there is no reason to believe that there is a god behind it for them there is no difference between spirit and matter and they do not accept the supreme spirit everything is matter only and the whole cosmos is supposed to be a mass of ignorance according to them everything is void and whatever manifestation exists is due to our ignorance in perception they take it for granted that all manifestation of diversity is a display of ignorance just as in a dream we may create so many things which actually have no existence so when we are awake we shall see that everything is simply a dream but factually although the demons say that life is a dream they are very expert in enjoying this dream and so instead of acquiring knowledge they become more and more implicated in their dreamland they conclude that as a child is simply the result of sexual intercourse between man and woman this world is copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved born without any soul for them it is only a combination of matter that has produced the living entities and there is no question of the existence of the soul as many living creatures come out from perspiration and from a dead body without any cause the whole living world has come out of the material combinations of the cosmic manifestation therefore material nature is the cause of this manifestation and there is no other cause they do not believe in the words of ka in bhagavadgt maydhyakea prakti syate sacarcaram under my direction the whole material world is moving in other words among the demons there is no perfect knowledge of the creation of the world every one of them has some particular theory of his own according to them one interpretation of the scriptures is as good as

of all sense they try to enjoy this material world to the utmost limit and therefore always engage in inventing something for sense gratification such materialistic inventions are considered to be advancement of human civilization but the result is that people grow more and more violent and more and more cruel cruel to animals and cruel to other human beings they have no idea how to behave toward one another animal killing is very prominent amongst demoniac people such people are considered the enemies of the world because ultimately they will invent or create something which will bring destruction to all indirectly this verse anticipates the invention of nuclear weapons of which the whole world is today very proud at any moment war may take place and these atomic weapons may create havoc such things are created solely for the destruction of the world and this is indicated here due to godlessness such weapons are invented in human society they are not meant for the peace and

increasing and increasing their insatiable desires for material enjoyment although they are always full of anxieties on account of accepting nonpermanent things they still continue to engage in such activities out of illusion they have no knowledge and cannot tell that they are heading the wrong way accepting nonpermanent things such demoniac people create their own god create their own hymns and chant accordingly the result is that they become more and more attracted to two thingssex enjoyment and accumulation of material wealth the word aucivrat unclean vows is very significant in this connection such demoniac people are only attracted by wine women gambling and meateating those are their auci unclean habits induced by pride and false prestige they create some principles of religion

this concept they maintain until death they do not believe in life after death and they do not believe that one takes on different types of bodies according to ones karma or activities in this world their plans for life are never finished and they go on preparing plan after plan all of which are never finished we have personal experience of a person of such demoniac mentality who even at the point of death was requesting the physician to prolong his life for four years more because his plans were not yet complete such foolish people do not know that a physician cannot prolong life even for a moment when the notice is there there is no consideration of the mans desire the laws of nature do not allow a second beyond what one is destined to enjoy the demoniac person who has no faith in god or the supersoul within himself performs all kinds of sinful activities simply for sense gratification he does not know that there is a witness sitting within his heart the supersoul is observing the activities of the individual soul as it is stated in the upaniads there are two birds sitting in one tree one is acting and enjoying or suffering the fruits of the branches and the other is witnessing but one who is demoniac has no knowledge of vedic scripture nor has he any faith therefore he feels free to do anything for sense enjoyment regardless of the consequences texts 1315 wdma

further for that reason he copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved does not hesitate to act in any sinful way and so deals in the black market for illegal gratification he

is gaining is due to his past good deeds he is given an opportunity to accumulate such things but he has no conception of past causes he simply thinks that all his mass of wealth is due to his own endeavor a demoniac person believes in the strength of his personal work not in the law of karma according to the law of karma a man takes his birth in a high family or becomes rich or very well educated or very beautiful because of good work in the past the demoniac think that all these things are accidental and due to the strength of ones personal ability they do not sense any arrangement behind all the varieties of people beauty and education anyone who comes into competition with such a demoniac man is his enemy there are many demoniac people and each is enemy to the others this enmity becomes more and more deepbetween persons then between families then between societies and at last between nations therefore there is constant strife war and enmity all over the world each demoniac person thinks that he can live at the sacrifice of all others generally a demoniac person thinks of himself as the supreme god and a demoniac preacher tells his followers why are you seeking god elsewhere you are all yourselves god whatever you like you can do dont believe in god throw away god god is dead these are the demoniacs preachings although the demoniac person sees others equally rich and influential or even more so he thinks that no one is richer than he and that no one is more influential than he as far as promotion to the higher planetary system is concerned he does not believe in performing yajas or sacrifices demons think that they will manufacture their own process of yaja and prepare some machine by which they will be able to reach any higher planet the best example of such a demoniac man was rvaa he offered a program to the people by which he would prepare a staircase so that anyone could reach the heavenly planets without performing sacrifices such as

regulations of the vedas are meant for knowing ka if one understands ka from the bhagavadgt and becomes situated in ka consciousness engaging himself in devotional service he has reached the highest perfection of knowledge offered by the vedic literature lord caitanya mahprabhu made this process very easy he asked people simply to chant hare ka hare ka ka ka hare hare hare rma hare rma rma rma hare hare and to engage in the devotional service of the lord and eat the remnants of foodstuff offered to the deity one who is directly engaged in all these devotional activities is to be understood as having studied all vedic literature he has come to the conclusion perfectly of course for the ordinary persons who are not in ka consciousness or who are not engaged in devotional service what is to be done and what is not to be done must be decided by the injunctions of the vedas one should act accordingly without argument that is called following the principles of stra or scripture stra is without the four copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved principal defects that are visible in the conditioned soul imperfect senses the propensity for cheating certainty of committing mistakes and certainty of being illusioned these four principal defects in conditioned life disqualify one from putting forth rules and regulations therefore the rules and regulations as described in the strabeing above these defectsare accepted without alteration by all great saints cryas and great souls in india there are many parties of spiritual understanding generally classified as two the impersonalist and the personalist both of them however lead their lives according to the principles of the vedas without following the principles of the scriptures one cannot elevate himself to the perfectional stage one who actually therefore understands the purport of the stras is considered fortunate in human society aversion to the principles of understanding the supreme personality of godhead is the cause of all falldowns that is the greatest offense of human life therefore my the material energy of the supreme personality of godhead is always giving us trouble in the shape of the threefold miseries this material energy is constituted of the three modes of material nature one has to raise himself at least to the mode of goodness before the path to understanding the supreme lord can be opened without raising oneself to the standard of the mode of goodness one remains in ignorance and passion which are the cause of demoniac life those in the modes of passion and ignorance deride the scriptures deride the holy man and deride the proper understanding of the supreme personality of godhead they disobey the instructions of the spiritual master and they do not care for the regulations of the scriptures in spite of hearing the glories of devotional service they are not attracted thus they manufacture their own way of elevation these are some of the defects of human society which lead to the demoniac status of life if however one is able to be guided by a proper and bona fide spiritual master who can lead one to the path of elevation to the higher stage then ones life becomes successful thus end the bhaktivedanta purports to the sixteenth chapter of the rmad bhagavadgt in the matter of the divine and demoniac natures copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta

purport in the fourth chapter thirtyninth verse it is said that a person faithful to a particular type of worship gradually becomes elevated to the stage of knowledge and attains the highest perfectional stage of peace and prosperity in the sixteenth chapter it is concluded that one who does not follow the principles laid down in the scriptures is called an asura demon and one who follows the scriptural injunctions faithfully is called a deva or demigod now if one with faith follows some rules which are not mentioned in the scriptural injunctions what is his position this doubt of arjunas is to be cleared by ka are those who create some sort of god by selecting a human being and placing their faith in him worshiping in goodness passion or ignorance do such persons attain the perfectional stage of life is it possible for them to be situated in real knowledge and elevate themselves to the highest perfectional stage do those who do not follow the rules and regulations of the

mode of goodness passion or ignorance they acquire a nature which is of a specific quality the association of the living entity with the different modes of nature has been going on perpetually since the living entity is in contact with material nature he acquires different types of mentality according to his association with the material modes but this nature can be changed if one associates with a bona fide spiritual master and abides by his rules and the scriptures gradually one can change his position from ignorance to goodness or from passion to goodness the conclusion is that blind faith in a particular mode of nature cannot help a person become elevated to the perfectional stage one has to consider things carefully with intelligence in the association of a bona fide spiritual master thus one can change his position to a higher mode of nature copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved text 3 satvanaupaa savrsya a avita aarta amayaaeya pauzae yaae yac sa

of nature one evolves a particular kind of faith the living being is said to be of a particular faith according to the modes he has acquired purport everyone has a particular type of faith regardless of what he is but his faith is considered good passionate or ignorant according to the nature he has acquired thus according to his particular type of faith one associates with certain persons now the real fact is that every living being as is stated in the fifteenth chapter is originally a fragmental part and parcel of the supreme lord therefore one is originally transcendental to all the modes of material nature but when one forgets his relationship with the supreme personality of godhead and comes into contact with the material nature in conditional life copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved he generates his own position by association with the different varieties of material nature the resultant artificial faith and existence are only material although one may be conducted by some impression or some conception of life originally he is nirgua or transcendental therefore one has to become cleansed of the material contamination that he has acquired in order to regain his relationship with the supreme lord that is the only path back without fear ka consciousness if one is situated in ka consciousness then that path is guaranteed for his elevation to the perfectional stage if one does not take to this path of selfrealization then he is surely to be conducted by the influence of the modes of nature the word raddh or faith is very significant in this verse raddh or faith originally comes out of the mode of goodness ones faith may be in a demigod or some created god or some mental concoction ones strong faith is supposed to be productive of works of material goodness but in material conditional life no works are completely purified they are mixed they are not in pure goodness pure goodness is transcendental in purified goodness one can understand the real nature of the supreme personality of godhead as long as ones faith is not completely in purified goodness the faith is subject to contamination by any of the modes of material nature the contaminated modes of material nature expand to the heart therefore according to the position of the heart in contact with a particular mode of material nature ones faith is established it should be understood that if ones heart is in the mode of goodness his faith is also in the mode of goodness if his heart is in the mode of passion his faith is also in the mode of passion and if his heart is in the mode of darkness illusion his faith is also thus contaminated thus we find different types of faith in this world and there are different types of religions due to different types of faith the real principle of religious faith is situated in the mode of pure goodness but because the heart is tainted we find different types of religious principles thus according to different types of faith there are different kinds of worship text 4 copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved yajantae saaitvka devanyaaraaisa rajasaa paetaanautagaaaanyae yajantae

worshipers according to their external activities according to scriptural injunction only the supreme personality of godhead is worshipable but those who are not very conversant with or faithful to the scriptural injunctions worship different objects according to their specific situations in the modes of material nature those who are situated in goodness generally worship the demigods the demigods include brahm iva and others such as indra candra and the sungod there are various demigods those in goodness worship a particular demigod for a particular purpose similarly those who are in the mode of passion worship the demons we recall that during the second copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved world war a man in calcutta worshiped hitler because thanks to that war he had amassed a large amount of wealth by dealing in the black market similarly those in the modes of passion and ignorance generally select a powerful man to be god they think that anyone can be worshiped as god and that the same results will be obtained now it is clearly described here that those who are in the mode of passion worship and create such gods and those who are in the mode of ignorance in darkness worship dead spirits sometimes people worship at the tomb of some dead man sexual service is also considered to be in the mode of darkness similarly in remote villages in india there are worshipers of ghosts we have seen that in india the lowerclass people sometimes go to the forest and if they have knowledge that a ghost lives in a tree they worship that tree and offer sacrifices these different kinds of worship are not actually god worship god worship is for persons who are transcendentally situated in pure goodness in the rmadbhgavatam 4323 it is said sattva viuddha vasudevaabditam when a man is situated in pure goodness he worships vsudeva the purport is that those who are completely purified of the material modes of nature and who are transcendentally situated can worship the supreme personality of godhead the impersonalists are supposed to be situated in the mode of goodness and they worship five kinds of demigods they worship the impersonal viu form in the material world which is known as philosophized viu viu is the expansion of the supreme personality of godhead but the impersonalists because they do not ultimately believe in the supreme personality of godhead imagine that the viu form is just another aspect of the impersonal brahman similarly they imagine that lord brahm is the impersonal form in the material mode of passion thus they sometimes describe five kinds of gods that are worshipable but because they think that the actual truth is impersonal brahman they dispose of all worshipable objects at the ultimate end in conclusion the different qualities of the material modes of nature can be purified through association with persons who are of transcendental nature texts 56 copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta

intl all rights reserved purport there are persons who manufacture modes of austerity and penance which are not mentioned in the scriptural injunctions for instance fasting for some ulterior purpose such as to promote a purely political end is not mentioned in the scriptural directions the scriptures recommend fasting for spiritual advancement not for some political end or social purpose persons who take to such austerities are according to bhagavadgt certainly demoniac their acts are against the scriptural injunctions and are not beneficial for the people in general actually they act out of pride false ego lust and attachment for material enjoyment by such activities not only is the combination of material elements of which the body is constructed disturbed but also the supreme personality of godhead himself living within the body such unauthorized fasting or austerities for some political end are certainly very disturbing to others they are not mentioned in the vedic literature a demoniac person may think that he can force his enemy or other parties to comply with his desire by this method but sometimes one dies by such fasting these acts are not approved by the supreme personality of godhead and he says that those who engage in them are demons such demonstrations are insults to the supreme personality of godhead because they are enacted in disobedience to the vedic scriptural injunctions the word acetasa is significant in this connection persons of normal mental condition must obey the scriptural injunctions those who are not in such a position neglect and disobey the scriptures and manufacture their own way of austerities and penances one should always remember the ultimate end of the demoniac people as described in the previous chapter the lord forces them to take birth in the wombs of demoniac persons consequently they will live by demoniac principles life after life without knowing their relationship with the supreme personality of godhead if however such persons are fortunate enough to be guided by a spiritual master who can direct them to the path of vedic wisdom they can get out of this entanglement and ultimately achieve the supreme

milk butter cheese and similar products give animal fat in a form which rules out any need for the killing of innocent creatures it is only through brute mentality that this killing goes on the

fresh any food cooked more than three hours before it is eaten except prasdam food offered to the lord is considered to be in the mode of darkness because they are decomposing such foods give a bad

first eaten by saintly persons especially the spiritual master otherwise the remnants of food are considered to be in copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved the mode of darkness and they increase infection or disease such foodstuffs although very palatable to persons in the mode of darkness are neither liked nor even touched by those in the mode of goodness the best food is the remnants of what is offered to the supreme personality of godhead in bhagavadgt the supreme lord says that he accepts preparations of vegetables flour and milk when offered with devotion patra pupa phala toyam of course devotion and love are the chief things which the supreme personality of godhead accepts but it is also mentioned that the prasdam should be prepared in a particular way any food prepared by the injunctions of the scripture and offered to the supreme personality of godhead can be taken even if prepared long long ago because such food is transcendental therefore to

gratification to purify ones nature is to become ka conscious satisfaction of the mind can be obtained only by taking the mind away from thoughts of sense enjoyment the more we think of sense enjoyment the more the mind becomes dissatisfied in the present age we unnecessarily engage the mind in so many different ways for sense gratification and so there is no possibility of the minds becoming satisfied the best course is to divert the mind to the vedic literature which is full of satisfying stories as in the puras and the mahbhrata one can take advantage of this knowledge and thus become purified the mind should be devoid of duplicity and one should think of the welfare of all silence means that one is always thinking of selfrealization the person in ka consciousness observes

were used to indicate the supreme absolute truth these three symbolic representations were used by brhmaas while chanting the hymns of the vedas and during sacrifices for the satisfaction of the supreme purport it has been explained that penance sacrifice charity and foods are divided into three categories the modes of goodness passion and ignorance but whether first class second class or third class they are all conditioned contaminated by the material modes of nature when they are aimed at the supremeo tat sat the supreme personality of godhead the eternalthey become means for spiritual elevation in the scriptural injunctions such an objective is indicated these three words o tat sat particularly indicate the absolute truth the supreme personality of godhead in the vedic hymns the word o is always found one who acts without following the regulations of the scriptures will not attain the absolute truth he will get some temporary result but not the ultimate end of life the conclusion is that the performance of charity sacrifice and penance must be done in the mode of goodness performed in the mode of passion or ignorance they are certainly inferior in quality the three words o tat sat are uttered in conjunction with the holy name of the supreme lord eg o tad vio whenever a vedic hymn or the holy name of the supreme lord is uttered o is added this is the indication of vedic literature these three words are taken from vedic hymns o ity etad brahmao nediha nma g veda indicates the first goal then tat tvam asi chndogya upaniad 687 indicates the second goal and sad eva saumya chndogya upaniad 621 indicates the third goal combined they become o tat sat formerly when brahm the first created living entity performed sacrifices he indicated by these three words the supreme personality of godhead therefore the same principle has always been followed by disciplic copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved succession so this hymn has great significance bhagavadgt recommends therefore that any work done should be done for o tat sat or for the supreme personality of godhead when one performs penance charity and

without the proper guidance there can never be any fruit in all the vedic scriptures faith in the supreme is advised in the pursuit of all vedic instructions the ultimate goal is the understanding of

devotees takes directly to ka consciousness that is the best way and that is recommended in this chapter to achieve success in this way one must first find the proper copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta

chapter of bhagavadgt lord ka stresses that devotional service unto the supreme personality of godhead is the ultimate goal of life this same point is summarized in the eighteenth chapter as the most confidential path of knowledge in the first six chapters stress was given to devotional service yoginm api sarve of all yogs or transcendentalists one who always thinks of me within himself is best in the next six chapters pure devotional service and its nature and activity were discussed in the third six chapters knowledge renunciation the activities of material nature and transcendental nature and devotional service were described it was concluded that all acts should be performed in conjunction with the supreme lord represented by the words o tat sat which indicate viu the supreme person the third part of bhagavadgt has shown that devotional service and nothing else is the ultimate purpose of life this has been established by citing past cryas and the brahmastra the vedntastra certain impersonalists consider themselves to have a monopoly on the knowledge of vedntastra but actually the vedntastra is meant for understanding devotional service for the lord himself is the composer of the vedntastra and he is its knower that is described in the fifteenth chapter in every scripture every veda devotional service is the objective that is explained in bhagavadgt as in the second chapter a synopsis of the whole subject matter was described in the eighteenth chapter also the summary of all instruction is copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved given the purpose of life is indicated to be renunciation and attainment of the transcendental position above the three material modes of nature arjuna wants to clarify the two distinct subject matters of bhagavadgt namely renunciation tyga and the renounced order of life sannysa thus he is asking the meaning of these two words two words used in this verse to address the supreme lordhkea and kenidanaare significant hkea is ka the master of all senses who can always help us attain mental serenity arjuna requests him to summarize everything in such a way that he can remain equipoised yet he has some doubts and doubts are always compared to demons he therefore addresses ka as kenidana ke was a most formidable demon who was killed by the lord now arjuna is expecting ka to kill the demon of

knowledge are not to be given up this will be made clear in the next verses in the vedic literature there are many prescriptions of methods for performing sacrifice for some particular purpose there are certain sacrifices to perform to attain a good son or to attain elevation to the higher planets but sacrifices prompted by desires should be stopped however sacrifice for the purification of ones

sacrifice is recommended in the vedic literature the animal is not considered to be killed the sacrifice is to give a new life to the animal sometimes the animal is given a new animal life after being killed in the sacrifice and sometimes the animal is promoted immediately to the human form of life but there are different opinions among the sages some say that animal killing should always be

for advancing a human being to spiritual life the marriage ceremony for example is considered to be one of these sacrifices it is called vivhayaja should a sannys who is in the renounced order of life and who has given up his family relations encourage the marriage ceremony the lord says here that any sacrifice which is meant for human welfare should never be given up vivhayaja the marriage ceremony is meant to regulate the human mind so that it may become peaceful for spiritual advancement for most men this vivhayaja should be encouraged even by persons in the renounced order of life sannyss should never associate with women but that does not mean that one who is in the lower stages of life a young man should not accept a wife in the marriage ceremony all prescribed sacrifices are

are never affected by sinful reactions purport ones occupational duty is prescribed in bhagavadgt as already discussed in previous verses the duties of a brhmaa katriya vaiya and dra are prescribed according to their particular modes of nature one should not imitate anothers duty a man who is by nature attracted to the kind of work done by dras should not artificially claim to be a brhmaa although he may have been born into a brhmaa family in this way one should work according to his own nature no work is abominable if performed in the service of the supreme lord the occupational duty of a brhmaa is certainly in the mode of goodness but if a person is not by nature in the mode of goodness he should not imitate the occupational duty of a brhmaa for a katriya or administrator there are so many abominable things a katriya has to be violent to kill his enemies and sometimes a katriya has to tell lies for the sake of diplomacy such violence and duplicity accompany political affairs but a katriya is not supposed to give up his occupational duty and try to perform the duties of a brhmaa one should act to satisfy the supreme lord for example arjuna was a katriya he was hesitating to fight the other party but if such fighting is performed for the sake of ka the supreme personality of godhead there need be no fear of degradation in the business field also sometimes a merchant has to tell so many lies to make a profit if he does not do so there can be no profit sometimes a merchant says oh my dear customer for you i am making no profit but one should know that without profit the merchant cannot exist therefore it should be taken as a simple lie if a merchant says that he is not making a profit but the merchant should not think that because he is engaged in an occupation in which the telling of lies is compulsory he should give up his profession and pursue the profession of a brhmaa that is copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved not recommended whether one is a katriya a vaiya or a dra doesnt matter if he serves by his work the supreme personality of godhead even brhmaas who perform different types of sacrifice sometimes must kill animals because sometimes animals are sacrificed in such ceremonies similarly if a katriya engaged in his own occupation kills an enemy there is no sin incurred in the third chapter these matters have been clearly and elaborately explained every man should work for the purpose of yaja or for viu the supreme personality of godhead anything done for personal sense gratification is a cause of bondage the conclusion is that everyone should be engaged according to the particular mode of nature he has acquired and he should decide to work only to serve the supreme cause of the supreme lord text 48 sahja kmar kaentaeya sadaezmaipa na tyajaeta savarrmaa ih daezea daumaenaaiganirvavtaa 48 sahaja karma kaunteya sadoam api na tyajet sarvrambh hi doea dhmengnir ivvt

work is full of fault copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved purport in conditioned life all work is contaminated by the material modes of nature even if one is a brhmaa he has to perform sacrifices in which animal killing is necessary similarly a katriya however pious he may be has to fight enemies he cannot avoid it similarly a merchant however pious he may be must sometimes hide his profit to stay in business or he may sometimes have to do business on the black market these things are necessary one cannot avoid them similarly even though a man is a dra serving a bad master he has to carry out the order of the master even though it should not be done despite these flaws one should continue to carry out his prescribed duties for they are born out of his own nature a very nice example is given herein although fire is pure still there is smoke yet smoke does not make the fire impure even though there is smoke in the fire fire is still considered to be the purest of all elements if one prefers to give up the work of a katriya and take up the occupation of a brhmaa he is not assured that in the occupation of a brhmaa there are no unpleasant duties one may then conclude that in the material world no one can be completely free from the contamination of material nature this example of fire and smoke is very appropriate in this connection when in wintertime one takes a stone from the fire sometimes smoke disturbs the eyes and other parts of the body but still one must make use of the fire despite disturbing conditions similarly one should not give up his natural occupation because there are some disturbing elements rather one should be determined to serve the supreme lord by his occupational duty in ka consciousness that is the perfectional point when a particular type of occupation is performed for the satisfaction of the supreme lord all the defects in that particular occupation are purified when the results of work are purified when connected with devotional service one becomes perfect in seeing the self within and that is selfrealization text 49 copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved

trance and who is detached free from false ego false strength false pride lust anger and acceptance of material things free from false proprietorship and peacefulsuch a person is certainly elevated to the position of selfrealization purport when one is purified by intelligence he keeps himself in the mode of goodness thus one becomes the controller of the mind and is always in trance he is not attached to the objects of sense gratification and he is free from attachment and hatred in his activities such a detached person naturally prefers to live in a secluded place he does not eat more than what he requires and he controls the activities of his body and mind he has no false ego because he does not accept the body as himself nor has he a desire to make the body fat and strong by accepting so many material things because he has no bodily concept of life he is not falsely proud he is satisfied with everything that is offered to him by the grace of the lord and he is never angry in the absence of sense gratification nor does he endeavor to acquire sense objects copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved thus when he is completely free from false ego he becomes nonattached to all material things and that is the stage of selfrealization of brahman that stage is called the brahmabhta stage when one is free from the material conception of life he becomes peaceful and cannot be agitated this is described in bhagavadgt 270 pryamam acalapratiha samudram pa pravianti yadvat tadvat km ya pravianti sarve sa ntim pnoti na kmakm a person who is not

joyful he never laments or desires to have anything he is equally disposed toward every living entity in that state he attains pure devotional service unto me purport to the impersonalist achieving the brahmabhta stage becoming one with the absolute is the last word but for the personalist or pure devotee one has to go still further to become engaged in pure devotional service this means that one who is engaged in pure devotional service to the supreme lord is already in a state of liberation called brahmabhta oneness with the absolute without being one with the supreme the absolute one cannot render service unto him in the absolute conception there is no difference between the served and the servitor yet the distinction is there in a higher spiritual sense in the material concept of life when one works for sense gratification there is misery but in the absolute world when one is engaged in pure devotional service there is no misery the devotee in ka consciousness has nothing for which to lament or desire since god is full a living entity who is engaged in gods service in ka consciousness becomes also full in himself he is just like a river cleansed of all dirty water because a pure devotee has no thought other than ka he is naturally always joyful he does not lament for any material loss or aspire for gain because he is full in the service of the lord he has no desire for material enjoyment because he knows that every living entity is a fragmental part and parcel of the supreme lord and therefore eternally a servant he does not see in the material world someone as higher and someone as lower higher and lower positions are ephemeral and a devotee has nothing to do with ephemeral appearances or disappearances for him stone and gold are of equal value this is the brahmabhta stage and this stage is attained very easily by the pure devotee in that stage of existence the idea of becoming one with the supreme brahman and annihilating ones individuality becomes hellish the idea of attaining the heavenly kingdom becomes phantasmagoria and the senses are like serpents teeth that are copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved broken as there is no fear of a serpent with broken teeth there is no fear from the senses when they are automatically controlled the world is miserable for the materially infected person but for a devotee the entire world is as good as vaikuha or the spiritual sky the highest personality in this material universe is no more significant than an ant for a devotee such a stage can be achieved by the mercy of lord caitanya who preached pure devotional service in this age text 55 aya maamaiajaanaaita yaavanyaaisma tatvta tataae maa tatvtaae jatva ivxatae tadnantarma 55 bhakty mm abhijnti yvn ya csmi

cannot be understood by mental speculation nor by the nondevotees if anyone wants to understand the supreme personality of godhead he has to take to pure devotional service under the guidance of a pure devotee otherwise the truth of the supreme personality of godhead will always be hidden as already stated in bhagavadgt 725 nha praka sarvasya he is not revealed to everyone no one can understand god simply by erudite scholarship or mental speculation only one who is actually engaged in ka consciousness and devotional service can understand what ka is university degrees are not helpful one who is fully conversant with the ka science becomes eligible to enter into the spiritual kingdom the abode of ka becoming brahman does not mean that one loses his identity devotional service is there and as long as devotional service exists there must be god the devotee and the process of devotional service such knowledge is never vanquished even after liberation liberation involves getting free from the concept of material life in spiritual life the same distinction is there the same individuality is there but in pure ka consciousness one should not mistakenly think that the word viate enters into me supports the monist theory that one becomes homogeneous with the impersonal brahman no viate means that one can enter into the abode of the supreme lord in ones individuality to engage in his association and render service unto him for instance a green bird enters a green tree not to become one with the tree but to enjoy the fruits of the tree impersonalists generally give the example of a river flowing into the ocean and merging this may be a source of happiness for the impersonalist but the personalist keeps his personal individuality like an aquatic in the ocean we find so many living entities within the ocean if we go deep surface acquaintance with the ocean is not sufficient one must have complete knowledge of the aquatics living in the ocean depths because of his pure devotional service a devotee can understand the transcendental qualities and the opulences of the supreme lord in truth as it is stated in the eleventh chapter only by devotional service can one understand the same is confirmed here one can understand the supreme personality of godhead by devotional service and enter into his kingdom copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved after attainment of the brahmabhta stage of freedom from material conceptions devotional service begins by ones hearing about the lord when one hears about the supreme lord automatically the brahmabhta stage develops and material contaminationgreediness and lust for sense enjoymentdisappears as lust and desires disappear from the heart of a devotee he becomes more attached to the service of the lord and by such attachment he becomes free from material contamination in that state of life he can understand the supreme lord this is the statement of rmadbhgavatam also after liberation the process of bhakti or transcendental service continues the vedntastra 4112 confirms this pryat tatrpi hi dam this means that after liberation the process of devotional service continues in the rmadbhgavatam real devotional liberation is defined as the reinstatement of the living entity in his own identity his own constitutional position the constitutional position is already explained every living entity is a partandparcel fragmental portion of the supreme lord therefore his constitutional position is to serve after liberation this service is never stopped actual liberation is getting

he acts only on the order of the master a servant acting on behalf of the supreme master is unaffected by profit and loss he simply discharges his duty faithfully in terms of the order of the lord now one may argue that arjuna was acting under the personal direction of ka but when ka is not present how should one act if one acts according to the direction of ka in this book as well as under the guidance of the representative of ka then the result will be the same the sanskrit word matpara is very important in this verse it indicates that one has no goal in life save and except acting in ka consciousness just to satisfy ka and while working in that way one should think of ka only i have been appointed to discharge this particular duty by ka while acting in such a way one naturally has to think of ka this is perfect ka consciousness one should however note that after doing something whimsically he should not offer the result to the supreme lord that sort of duty is not in the devotional service of ka consciousness one should act according to the order of ka this is a very important point that order of ka comes through disciplic succession from the bona fide spiritual

one should not falsely think himself independent of the laws of material nature or free to act he is already under copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved strict material laws but as soon as he acts in ka consciousness he is liberated free from the material perplexities one should note very carefully that one who is not active in ka consciousness is losing himself in the material whirlpool in the ocean of birth and death no conditioned soul actually knows what is to be done and what is not to be done but a person who acts in ka consciousness is free to act because

actions as if he were directing the good and bad results of such work he forgot that the supreme personality of godhead was present there instructing him to fight that is the forgetfulness of the

arjuna should give up all the processes that have been explained to him he should simply surrender to ka that surrender will save him from all kinds of sinful reactions for the lord personally promises to protect him in the seventh chapter it was said that only one who has become free from all sinful reactions can take to the worship of lord ka thus one may think that unless he is free from all sinful reactions he cannot take to the surrendering process to such doubts it is here said that even if one is not free from all sinful reactions simply by the process of surrendering to r ka he is automatically freed there is no need of strenuous effort to free oneself from sinful reactions one should unhesitatingly accept ka as the supreme savior copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust

sometimes found that even demoniac persons who are envious of ka worshiping ka in a different way take to the profession of explaining bhagavadgt in a different way to make business but anyone who desires actually to understand ka must avoid such commentaries on bhagavadgt actually the purpose of bhagavadgt is not understandable to those who are sensuous even if one is not sensuous but is strictly following the disciplines enjoined in the vedic scripture if he is not a devotee he also cannot understand ka and even when one poses himself as a devotee of ka but is not engaged in ka conscious activities he also cannot understand ka there are many persons who envy ka because he has explained in bhagavadgt that he is the supreme and that nothing is above him or equal to him there

of the lord in other words bhagavadgt is for the devotees only but it so happens that sometimes a devotee of the lord will hold open class and in that class not all the students are expected to be devotees why do such persons hold open class it is explained here that although not everyone is a devotee still there are many men who are not envious of ka they have faith in him as the supreme copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved personality of godhead if such persons hear from a bona fide devotee about the lord the result is that they become at once free from all sinful reactions and after that attain to the planetary system where all righteous persons are situated therefore simply by hearing bhagavadgt even a person who does not try to be a pure devotee attains the result of righteous activities thus a pure devotee of the lord gives everyone a chance to become free from all sinful reactions and to become a devotee of the lord generally those who are free from sinful reactions those who are righteous very easily take to ka consciousness the word puyakarmam is very significant here this refers to the performance of great sacrifices like the avamedhayaja mentioned in the vedic literature those who are righteous in performing devotional service but who are not pure can attain the planetary system of the polestar or dhruvaloka where dhruva

said my dear ka o infallible one my illusion is now gone i have regained my memory by your mercy i am now firm and free from doubt and am prepared to act according to your instructions purport the constitutional position of a living entity represented by arjuna is that he has to act according to the order of the supreme lord he is meant for selfdiscipline r caitanya mahprabhu says that the actual position of the living entity is that of eternal servant of the supreme lord forgetting this principle the living entity becomes conditioned by material nature but in serving the supreme lord he becomes the liberated servant of god the living entitys constitutional position is to be a servitor he has to serve either the illusory my or the supreme lord if he serves the supreme lord he is in his normal condition but if he prefers to serve the illusory external energy then certainly he will be in bondage in illusion the living entity is serving in this material world he is bound by his lust and desires yet he thinks of himself as the master of the world this is called illusion when a person is liberated his illusion is over and he voluntarily surrenders unto the supreme to act according to his desires the last illusion the last snare of my to trap the living entity is the proposition that he is god the living entity thinks that he is no longer a conditioned soul but god he is so unintelligent that he does not think that if he were god then how could he be in doubt that he does not consider so that is the last snare of illusion actually to become free from the illusory energy is to understand ka the supreme personality of godhead and agree to act according to his order the word moha is very important in this verse moha refers to that which is opposed to knowledge actually real knowledge is the understanding that copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved every living being is eternally a servitor of the lord but instead of thinking oneself in that position the living entity thinks that he is not a servant that he is the master of this material world for he wants to lord it over the material nature that is his illusion this illusion can be overcome by the mercy of the lord or by the mercy of a pure devotee when that illusion is over one agrees to act in ka consciousness ka consciousness is acting according to kas order a conditioned soul illusioned by the external energy of matter does not know that the supreme lord is the master who is full of knowledge and who is the proprietor of everything whatever he desires he can bestow upon his devotees he is the friend of everyone and he is especially inclined to his devotee he is the controller of this material nature and of all living entities he is also the controller of inexhaustible time and he is full of all opulences and all potencies the supreme personality of godhead can even give himself to the devotee one who does not know him is under the spell of illusion he does not become a devotee but a servitor of my arjuna however after hearing bhagavadgt from the supreme personality of godhead became free from all illusion he could understand that ka was not only his friend but the supreme personality of godhead and he understood ka factually so to study bhagavadgt is to understand ka factually when a person is in full knowledge he naturally surrenders to ka when arjuna understood that it was kas plan to reduce the unnecessary increase of population he agreed to fight according to kas desire he again took up his weaponshis arrows and bowto fight under the

important conversation between two great souls had never taken place before and would not take place again it was wonderful because the supreme personality of godhead was speaking about himself and his energies to the living entity arjuna a great devotee of the lord if we follow in the footsteps of arjuna to understand ka then our life will be happy and successful sajaya realized this and as he

spiritual master of sajaya and sajaya admits that it was by vysas mercy that he could understand the supreme personality of godhead this means that one has to understand ka not directly but through the medium of the spiritual master the spiritual master is the transparent medium although it is true that the experience is still direct this is the mystery of the disciplic succession when the spiritual master is bona fide then one can hear bhagavadgt directly as arjuna heard it there are many mystics and yogs all over the world but ka is the master of all yoga systems kas instruction is explicitly stated in bhagavadgtsurrender unto ka one who does so is the topmost yog this is confirmed in the last verse of the sixth chapter yoginm api sarvem nrada is the direct disciple of ka and the spiritual master of vysa copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved therefore vysa is as bona fide as arjuna because he comes in the disciplic succession and sajaya is the direct disciple of vysa therefore by the grace of vysa sajayas senses were purified and he could see and hear ka directly one who directly hears ka can understand this confidential knowledge if one does not come to the disciplic succession he cannot hear ka therefore his knowledge is always imperfect at least as far as understanding bhagavadgt is concerned in bhagavadgt all the yoga systemskarmayoga jnayoga and bhaktiyogaare explained ka is the master of all such mysticism it is to be understood however that as arjuna was fortunate enough to understand ka directly so by the grace of vysa sajaya was also able to hear ka directly actually there is no difference between hearing directly from ka and hearing directly from ka via a bona fide spiritual master like vysa the spiritual

arjuna the supreme archer there will also certainly be opulence victory extraordinary power and morality that is my opinion purport the bhagavadgt began with an inquiry of dhtarras he was hopeful of the victory of his sons assisted by great warriors like bhma droa and kara he was hopeful that the victory would be on his side but after describing the scene on the battlefield sajaya told the king you are thinking of victory but my opinion is that where ka and arjuna are present there will be all good fortune he directly confirmed that dhtarra could not expect victory for his side victory was certain for the side of arjuna because ka was there kas acceptance of the post of charioteer for arjuna was an exhibition of another opulence ka is full of all opulences and renunciation is one of them there are many instances of such renunciation for ka is also the master of renunciation the fight was actually between duryodhana and yudhihira arjuna was fighting on behalf of his elder brother yudhihira because ka and arjuna were on the side of yudhihira yudhihiras victory was certain the battle was to decide who would rule the world and sajaya predicted that the power would be transferred to yudhihira it is also predicted here that yudhihira after gaining victory in this battle would flourish more and more because not only was he righteous and pious but he was also a strict moralist he never spoke a lie during his life there are many less intelligent persons who take bhagavadgt to be a discussion of topics between two friends on a battlefield but such a book cannot be scripture some may protest that ka incited arjuna to fight which is immoral but the reality of the situation is clearly stated bhagavadgt is the supreme instruction in morality the supreme instruction of morality is stated in the ninth chapter in the thirtyfourth verse manman bhava madbhakta one must become a devotee of ka and the essence of all religion is to surrender unto ka sarvadharmn parityajya copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved mm eka araa vraja the instructions of bhagavadgt constitute the supreme process of religion and of morality all other processes may be purifying and may lead to this process but the last instruction of the gt is the last word in all morality and religion surrender unto ka this is the verdict of the eighteenth chapter from bhagavadgt we can understand that to realize oneself by philosophical speculation and by meditation is one process but to fully surrender unto ka is the highest perfection this is the essence of the teachings of bhagavadgt the path of regulative principles according to the orders of social life and according to the different courses of religion may be a confidential path of knowledge but although the rituals of religion are confidential meditation and cultivation of knowledge are still more confidential and surrender unto ka in devotional service in full ka consciousness is the most confidential instruction that is the essence of the eighteenth chapter another feature of bhagavadgt is that the actual truth is the supreme personality of godhead ka the absolute truth is realized in three featuresimpersonal brahman localized paramtm and ultimately the supreme personality of godhead ka perfect knowledge of the absolute truth means perfect knowledge of ka if one understands ka then all the departments of knowledge are part and parcel of that understanding ka is transcendental for he is always situated in his eternal internal potency the living entities are manifested of his energy and are divided into two classes eternally conditioned and eternally liberated such living entities are innumerable and they are considered fundamental parts of ka material energy is manifested into twentyfour divisions the creation is effected by eternal time and it is created and dissolved by external energy this manifestation of the cosmic world repeatedly becomes visible and invisible in bhagavadgt five principal subject matters have been discussed the supreme personality of godhead material nature the living entities eternal time and all kinds of activities all is dependent on the supreme personality of godhead ka all conceptions of the absolute truthimpersonal copyright 1998 the bhaktivedanta book trust intl all rights reserved brahman localized paramtm and any other transcendental conceptionexist within the category of understanding the supreme personality of godhead although superficially the supreme personality of godhead the living entity material nature and time appear to be different nothing is different from the supreme but the supreme is always different from everything lord caitanyas philosophy is that of inconceivable oneness and difference this system of philosophy constitutes perfect knowledge of the absolute truth the living entity in his original position is pure spirit he is just like an atomic particle of the supreme spirit thus lord ka may be compared to the sun and the living entities to sunshine because the living entities are the marginal energy of ka they have a tendency to be in contact either with the material energy or with the spiritual energy in other words the living entity is situated between the two energies of the lord and because he belongs to the superior energy of the lord he has a particle of independence by proper use of that independence he comes under the direct order of ka thus he attains his normal condition in the pleasuregiving potency thus end the bhaktivedanta purports to the eighteenth chapter of the rmad bhagavadgt in the matter of its conclusionthe perfection of renunciation
