philosophy of duty devotion and selfknowledge is wonderfully synthesized and harmonized in the gitawithout creating any conflict among themto give the reader eternal bliss everlasting peace and perennial joy in life it awakens cosmic consciousness and stimulates life with spirituality religion tends to create a wall of division and conflicts along religious lines whereas spirituality unites people by breaking those walls a spiritual person is a 2 international gita society friend of all and a foe of none because he considers all creaturesliving or nonlivingas part and parcel of the cosmic body of the absolute the source the message of the gita came to humanity due to arjunas unwillingness to do his duty as a warrior because fighting involved destruction and killing nonviolence or ahinsa is one of the most fundamental tenets of spiritual culture all lives human or nonhuman are sacred this immortal discourse between the supreme lord krishna and his devoteefriend arjuna occurs not in a temple a secluded forest or on a mountain top but on a battlefield on the eve of a big war anyone can be helped by practice of only a few of its teachings no change of ones faith or lifestyle is needed a total of seven hundred 700 verses of the gita in 18 chapters are recorded in worlds longest epic mahabharata having over 100000 verses in sanskrit poetry in gita lord krishna advises arjuna to get up and fight this may create a misunderstanding of the principles of nonviolence if the background of the war of mahabharata is not kept in mind therefore a brief historical description is in order in ancient times there was a king who had two sons dhritarashtra and pandu the former was born blind therefore pandu inherited the kingdom pandu had five sons they were called the pandavas dhritarashtra had one hundred sons they were called the kauravas duryodhana was the eldest of the kauravas after the death of king pandu the eldest son of pandu became the lawful king duryodhana was a very jealous person he also wanted the kingdom the kingdom was divided into two halves between the pandavas and the kauravas duryodhana was not satisfied with his share of the kingdom he wanted the entire kingdom for himself he unsuccessfully planned several foul plays to kill the pandavas and take away their kingdom also he unlawfully took possession of the entire kingdom of the pandavas and refused to give back even an acre of land without a war all mediation by lord krishna and others failed the big war of mahabharata was thus inevitable the pandavas were unwilling participants they had only two choices fight for their right as a matter of duty or run away from war and accept defeat for the sake of peace and nonviolence arjuna one of the five pandava brothers faced this dilemma in the battlefield whether to fight or run away from war for peace arjunas dilemma is in reality the universal dilemma all human beings face dilemmas big or small in their everyday life while performing their duties arjunas dilemma was a big one he had to make a choice between fighting the war and killing his most revered guru who was on the other side very dear friends close relatives and many innocent warriors or running away from the bhagavadgita 3 battlefield for the sake of preserving peace and nonviolence the entire seven hundred verses of the bhagavadgita are a discourse between lord krishna and the confused arjuna on the battlefield near new delhi india in 3139 bce this discourse was narrated to the blind king dhritarashtra by his charioteer sanjaya as an eyewitness war report the word bhagavad means the supreme being god or bhagavan in sanskrit gita means song thus bhagavadgita means the song of god or the celestial song because it was sung by bhagavan lord krishna an incarnation of god himself chapter 1 1 arjunas dilemma the blind king inquired from his charioteer o sanjaya tell me in detail what did my sons and the pandavas do in the battlefield before the war started 101 chapter summary sanjaya said arjuna asked his charioteerfriend lord krishna to drive his chariot between the two armies so that he could see the armies on both sides arjuna felt great compassion to see his friends and relatives on the opposite side whom he must kill to win this war he became confused spoke of the evils of war and refused to fight or do his duty as a warrior arjuna sat down on the back seat of the chariot with his mind overwhelmed with sorrow verse 147 note some nonessential verses from chapters 1 and 2 only have been omitted for ease of understanding the teachings of the gita by the first time readers chapter 2 2 spiritual knowledge sanjaya said lord krishna spoke these words to arjuna whose eyes were tearful and downcast and who was overwhelmed with compassion and despair 201 o king lord krishna as if smiling spoke these words to distressed arjuna in the midst of the two armies 210 teachings of the gita begins important verses are highlighted first time readers should read and understand these verses first 4 international gita society the supreme lord said you grieve for those who are not worthy of grief and yet speak words of wisdom the wise grieve neither for the living nor for the dead 211 there was never a time when these monarchs you or i did not exist nor shall we ever cease to exist in the future 212 just as a living being acquires a childhood body a youth body and an oldage body during this life similarly it acquires another new body after death the wise are not deluded by this 213 the contacts of the senses with the sense objects give rise to the feelings of heat and cold pain and pleasure they are transitory and impermanent therefore learn to endure them o arjuna 214 because a calm person who is not afflicted by these sense objects and is steady in pain and pleasure becomes fit for immortality o arjuna 215 the spirit is eternal body is transitory the invisible spirit is eternal and the visible world including the physical body is transitory the reality of these two is indeed certainly seen by the seers of truth 216 the spirit by which all this universe is pervaded is indestructible no one can destroy the imperishable spirit 217 bodies of the eternal immutable and incomprehensible spirit are perishable therefore fight o arjuna 218 one who thinks that spirit is a slayer and one who thinks spirit is slain are both ignorant because spirit neither slays nor is slain 219 the spirit is neither born nor does it die at any time it does not come into being or cease to exist it is unborn eternal permanent and primeval the spirit is not destroyed when the body is destroyed 220 o arjuna how can a person who knows that the spirit is indestructible eternal unborn and immutable kill anyone or cause anyone to be killed 221 death and reincarnation of the soul just as a person puts on new garments after discarding the old ones similarly the living entity acquires new bodies after casting away the old bodies 222 weapons do not cut this spirit fire does not burn it water does not make it wet and the wind does not make it dry spirit cannot be cut burned wet or dried it is eternal allpervading unchanging immovable and primeval 22324 the spirit is said to be unexplainable incomprehensible and unchanging knowing this spirit as such you should not grieve 225 even if you think that this living being takes birth and dies perpetually even then o arjuna you should not grieve like this because death is certain for one who is born and birth is certain for one who dies and the cycle of birthdeath continues therefore you should not lament over the inevitable 22627 all beings o arjuna are unmanifest invisible to our physical eyes before birth and after death they manifest between the birth and the death only what is there to grieve about 228 some look upon bhagavadgita 5 this spirit as a wonder another describes it as wonderful and others hear of it as a wonder even after hearing about it very few people know it 229 o arjuna the spirit that dwells in the body of all beings is eternally indestructible therefore you should not mourn for anybody 230 duty of a warrior considering also your duty as a warrior you should not waver because there is nothing more auspicious for a warrior than a righteous war 231 only the fortunate warriors o arjuna get such an opportunity for a righteous war against evil that is like an open door to heaven 232 commentary the righteous war is not a religious war against the followers of other religions the righteous war may be waged even against our own evildoer kith and kin rigveda 67519 life is a continuous battle between the forces of evil and goodness whosoever kills an innocent human being it shall be regarded as if he has killed the entire humanity surah 532 it is better to die for a right cause and acquire the grace of sacrifice than to die an ordinary but compulsory death the gates of heaven open wide for those who stand up to vindicate justice and righteousness dharma not to oppose an evil is to indirectly support it very similar ideas are expressed in other scriptures of the world the bible says happy are those who suffer persecution because they do what god requires the kingdom of heaven belongs to them matthew 510 there is no sin in killing an aggressor whosoever helps and supports an aggressor is also an aggressor thus all those who supported kauravas were basically aggressors and deserved to be eliminated if you will not fight this righteous war then you will fail in your duty lose your reputation and incur sin 233 people will talk about your disgrace forever to the honored dishonor is worse than death 234 the great warriors will think that you have retreated from the battle out of fear those who have greatly esteemed you will lose respect for you 235 your enemies will speak many unmentionable words and scorn your ability what could be more painful to you than this 236 you will go to heaven if killed in the line of duty or you will enjoy the kingdom on the earth if victorious therefore get up with a determination to fight o arjuna 237 treating pleasure and pain gain and loss and victory and defeat alike engage yourself in your duty by doing your duty this way you will not incur sin 238 importance of karmayoga the selfless action the wisdom of spiritual knowledge has been imparted to you o arjuna now listen to the wisdom of karmayoga the selfless 6 international gita society service seva endowed with which you will free yourself from the bondage or reactions of action karma 239 in karmayoga no effort is ever lost and there is no adverse effect even a little practice of this discipline protects one from the great fear of birth and death 240 a karmayogi has a resolute determination for godrealization o arjuna but the desires of one who works to enjoy the fruits of work are endless 241 material and spiritual aspects of life the misguided ones who delight in the melodious chanting of the vedas or any scripture without understanding its real purpose think o arjuna as if there is nothing else in it except the rituals for the sole purpose of obtaining heavenly enjoyment 242 they are dominated by material desires and consider the attainment of heaven as the highest goal of life they engage in specific rites for the sake of prosperity and enjoyment rebirth is the result of their action 243 the resolute determination of selfrealization is not formed in the minds of those who are attached to pleasure and power and whose judgment is obscured by such ritualistic activities 244 a portion of the vedas deals with three modes or states of the material nature become free from pairs of opposites be ever balanced and unconcerned with the thoughts of acquisition and preservation rise above the three states and be selfconscious o arjuna 245 to a selfrealized person scriptures are as useful as a small reservoir of water when the water of a huge lake becomes available 246 theory and practice of karmayoga you have control over your respective duty only but no control or claim over the results the fruits of work should not be your only motive and you should never be inactive 247 do your duty to the best of your ability o arjuna with your mind attached to the lord abandoning worry and attachment to the results and remaining calm in both success and failure the calmness of mind is called karmayoga 248 work done with selfish motives is inferior by far to selfless service or karmayoga therefore be a karmayogi o arjuna those who work only to enjoy the fruits of their labor are in truth unhappy because one has no control over the results 249 a true karmayogi becomes free from both vice and virtue in this very life therefore strive for karmayoga working to the best of ones abilities without becoming attached to the fruits of work is called karmayoga 250 wise karmayogis are freed from the bondage of rebirth by renouncing attachment to the fruits of all work and attain a blissful divine state 251 when your intellect completely pierces the veil of confusion then you will become indifferent to what has been heard and what is to be heard from the scriptures 252 bhagavadgita 7 when your intellect that is confused by the conflicting opinions and the ritualistic doctrine of the vedas shall stay steady and firm on concentrating on the supreme being then you shall attain union with the supreme being in trance 253 arjuna said o krishna what are the marks of an enlightened person whose intellect is steady how does a person of steady intellect speak how does such a person sit and walk 254 marks of a selfrealized person the supreme lord said when one is completely free from all desires of the mind and is satisfied with the eternal being god by the joy of eternal being then one is called an enlightened person o arjuna 255 a person whose mind is unperturbed by sorrow who does not crave pleasures and who is completely free from attachment fear and anger is called a sage of steady mind 256 those who are not attached to anything who are neither elated by getting desired results nor troubled by undesired results their intellect is considered steady 257 when one can completely withdraw the senses from its sense objects as a tortoise withdraws its limbs into the shell for protection from dangers then the intellect of such a person is considered steady 258 the desire for sensual pleasures fades away if one abstains from sense enjoyment but the craving for sense enjoyment remains the craving also disappears from one who has known the supreme being 259 dangers of unrestrained senses restless senses o arjuna forcibly carry away the mind of even a wise person striving for perfection 260 one should fix ones mind on me with loving contemplation after bringing the senses under control ones intellect becomes steady when ones senses are under complete control 261 one develops attachment to sense objects by thinking about sense objects desire for sense objects comes from attachment to sense objects and anger comes from unfulfilled desires 262 delusion or wild ideas arise from anger the mind is bewildered by delusion reasoning is destroyed when the mind is bewildered one falls from the right path when reasoning is destroyed 263 peace through sense control and selfknowledge a disciplined person enjoying sense objects with senses that are under control and free from likes and dislikes attains tranquility 264 all sorrows are destroyed upon attainment of tranquility the intellect of such a tranquil person soon becomes completely steady and united with the source 265 there is neither selfknowledge nor selfperception to those who are not united with the eternal being without selfperception there is no peace and without peace there can be no happiness 266 8 international gita society the mind when controlled by roving senses steals away the intellect as a storm takes away a boat on the sea from its destination the spiritual shore 267 therefore o arjuna ones intellect becomes steady when the senses are completely withdrawn from its sense objects 268 a yogi the person of selfrestraint remains wakeful when it is night for all others it is night for a yogi who sees when all others are wakeful 269 note what is considered real by a yogi is of no value for a worldly person and viceversa one attains peace when all desires dissipate within the mind without creating any mental disturbance just as river waters enter the full ocean without creating any disturbance one who desires material objects is never peaceful 270 one who abandons all desires and becomes free from longing and the feeling of i and my attains peace 271 o arjuna this is the superconscious state of mind attaining this state one is no longer deluded gaining this state even at the end of ones life a person attains nirvana or becomes one with the absolute 272 chapter 3 3 path of selfless service karmayoga arjuna said if you consider acquiring spiritual knowledge is better than working then why do you want me to engage in this horrible war o krishna you seem to confuse my mind by apparently conflicting words tell me decisively one thing by which i may attain the supreme 30102 the supreme lord said in this world o arjuna a twofold path of spiritual discipline has been stated by me in the past the path of selfknowledge for the contemplative introverts and the path of unselfish work seva karmayoga for all others 303 one does not attain freedom from the bondage of karma by merely abstaining from work no one attains perfection by merely giving up work 304 because no one can remain actionless even for a moment everyone is driven to action helplessly indeed by the forces of nature 305 the deluded ones who restrain their organs of action but mentally dwell upon the sense enjoyment are called hypocrites 306 why one should serve others one who controls the senses by a trained and purified mind and intellect and engages the organs of action to selfless service is superior o arjuna 307 perform your obligatory duty because working is indeed better than sitting idle even the maintenance of your body would be impossible without work 308 human beings are bound by work that is not performed as a selfless service therefore o arjuna becoming free from attachment to the fruits of work do your duty efficiently as a service to me 309 bhagavadgita 9 the first commandment of the creator brahma the creator in the beginning created human beings together with selfless service seva sacrifice and said by seva or sacrifice of selfinterest you shall prosper and seva shall fulfill all your desires 310 help the celestial controllers devas with selfless service and they will help you thus helping each other you shall attain the supreme goal of human life 311 the celestial controllers pleased by selfless service will give you desired objects even without asking for it one who enjoys the gift of celestials without offering them anything in return is indeed a thief 312 the righteous who eat the remnants of selfless service are freed from all sins but the impious who cook food only for themselves without first offering to me or sharing with others in truth eat sin 313 the physical body of living beings is made up of and sustained by food food is created by god from five basic elements god is pleased by the sacrifice qurbani of selfinterest the selfless philanthropic work and blesses selfless persons selfless work or sacrifice is our duty duty is prescribed in the scriptures the scriptures come from god thus the allpervading god is ever present in selfless service seva 31415 one who does not help to keep the wheel of creation in motion by sacrificial duty and who rejoices sense pleasures only that sinful person lives in vain o arjuna 316 for a selfrealized person who rejoices only with god who is delighted with god and who is content with god there is no duty 317 such a person has no interest whatsoever in what is done or what is not done a selfrealized person does not depend on anybody except god for anything 318 leaders should set an example therefore always perform your duty efficiently and without any attachment to the results because by doing work without attachment one attains the supreme being 319 king janaka and others attained perfection or selfrealization by selfless service karmayoga alone you should also perform your duty with a view to guide people and for universal welfare of the society 320 whatever noble persons do others follow whatever standard they set up the world follows 321 o arjuna there is nothing in the three worlds heaven earth and the lower regions that should be done by me nor there is anything that i should obtain yet i engage in action 322 if i do not engage in action relentlessly o arjuna people would follow my path these worlds would perish if i do not work and i would be the cause of confusion and destruction of all these people 32324 as the ignorant work o arjuna with attachment to the fruits of work so the wise should work without attachment for the welfare of the society 325 the wise should not unsettle the minds of the ignorant who are attached to the fruits of 10 international gita society work but should inspire others by performing all works efficiently without attachment to results 326 all works are the works of nature all work is done by the energy and power of nature but due to delusion of ignorance people assume themselves to be the doer and thus incur sin or karmic bondage 327 one who knows the truth o arjuna about the role of the forces of nature and work does not become attached to work knowing very well that its the forces of nature that work with their instruments our organs 328 those who are deluded by the illusive power maya of nature become attached to the work done by the forces of nature the wise should not disturb the mind of the ignorant whose knowledge is imperfect 329 do your duty dedicating all work to me in a spiritual frame of mind free from desire attachment and mental grief 330 those who always practice this teaching of mine with faith sincerity and free from complain are freed from the bondage of karma but those who carp at my teaching and do not practice it should be considered ignorant of all knowledge senseless and lost 33132 all beings follow their nature even the wise act according to their own nature what then is the value of sense restraint 333 two stumbling blocks on the path likes and dislikes for sense objects remain in the senses one should not come under the control of these two because they are indeed two major stumbling blocks on ones path of selfrealization 334 ones inferior natural work is better than superior unnatural work death in carrying out ones natural work is useful unnatural work produces too much stress 335 lust is the origin of sin arjuna said o krishna what impels one to commit sin as if unwillingly and forced against ones will 336 the supreme lord said it is lust or intense desire for material and sensual pleasures born out of passion that becomes anger when unfulfilled lust is insatiable and is a great devil know this as the enemy 337 as the fire is covered by smoke as a mirror by dust and as an embryo by the amnion similarly selfknowledge becomes obscured by lust 338 o arjuna selfknowledge becomes covered by this insatiable fire of lust the eternal enemy of the wise 339 the senses the mind and the intellect are said to be the seat of lust lust by controlling the senses the mind and the intellect deludes a person by veiling selfknowledge 340 therefore o arjuna by controlling the senses first kill this devil of material desire that destroys selfknowledge and selfrealization 341 how to control lust the senses are said to be superior to the body the mind is superior to the senses the intellect is superior to the mind and bhagavadgita 11 spirit is superior to the intellect 342 thus knowing the spirit to be superior to the intellect and controlling the mind by the intellect that is purified by spiritual practices one must kill this mighty enemy lust o arjuna 343 chapter 4 4 path of renunciation with selfknowledge karmayoga is an ancient law the supreme lord said i taught this karmayoga the eternal science of selfless action to king vivasvan vivasvan taught it to manu manu taught it to ikshvaku thus handed down in succession the saintly kings knew this after a long time the science of karmayoga was lost from this earth today i have described the same ancient science to you because you are my sincere devotee and friend karmayoga is the supreme secret indeed 40103 arjuna said you were born later but vivasvan was born in ancient time how am i to understand that you taught this karmayoga in the beginning of the creation 404 the purpose of incarnation of god the supreme lord said both you and i have taken many births i remember them all o arjuna but you do not remember 405 though i am eternal immutable and the lord of all beings yet i manifest myself by controlling my own material nature using my divine potential energy maya 406 whenever there is a decline of dharma righteousness and a predominance of adharma or unrighteousness o arjuna then i manifest myself i appear from time to time for protecting the good for transforming the wicked and for establishing world order dharma 40708 the one who truly understands my transcendental appearance and activities of creation maintenance and dissolution attains my supreme abode and is not born again after leaving this body o arjuna 409 many have become free from attachment fear anger and attained salvation by taking refuge in me becoming fully absorbed in my thoughts and becoming purified by the fire of selfknowledge 410 path of worship and prayer with whatever motive people worship me i fulfill their desires accordingly people worship me with different motives 411 those who long for success in their work here on the earth worship the celestial controllers success in work comes quickly in this human world 412 the four divisions based on aptitude and vocation of human society were created by me though i am the author of this system of the division of labor one should know that i do nothing and i am eternal 413 work or karma does not bind me because i have no desire for the fruits of work the one who fully understands and practices this truth is also not bound by karma 414 the ancient seekers of liberation also performed 12 international gita society their duties with this understanding therefore you should do your duty as the ancients did 415 attached detached and forbidden action even the wise ones are confused about what is action and what is inaction therefore i shall clearly explain what is action knowing that one shall be liberated from the evil of birth and death 416 the true nature of action is very difficult to understand therefore one should know the nature of attached or selfish action the nature of detached or selfless action and also the nature of forbidden action 417 a karmayogi is not subject to the karmic laws the one who sees inaction in action and action in inaction is a wise person such a person is a yogi and has accomplished everything 418 to see inaction in action and vice versa is to understand that the lord does all the work indirectly through his power by using us he is the inactive actor we are actively inactive because we cannot do anything without the flow of his power therefore we are not the doer just an instrument in his hands a person whose desires have become selfless by being roasted in the fire of selfknowledge is called a sage by the wise 419 the one who has abandoned attachment to the fruits of work and remains ever content and dependent on no one but god such a person though engaged in activity does nothing at all and incurs no karmic reaction good or bad 420 the one who is free from desires whose mind and senses are under control and who has renounced all proprietorship does not incur sin the karmic reaction by doing bodily action 421 content with whatever gain comes naturally by his will unaffected by pairs of opposites free from envy calm in success and failure though engaged in work such a karmayogi is not bound by karma 422 the one who is free from attachment whose mind is fixed in selfknowledge who does work as a service seva to the lord all karmic bonds of such a philanthropic person karmayogi dissolve away 423 god shall be realized by the one who considers everything as a manifestation or an act of god also see 916 424 different types of spiritual practices some yogis perform the service of worship to celestial controllers devas guardian angels while others study scriptures for selfknowledge some restrain their senses and give up their sensual pleasures others perform breathing and other yogic exercises some give charity and offer their wealth as a sacrifice 425 bhagavadgita 13 28 those who are engaged in yogic practices reach the breathless state of trance samadhi by offering inhalation into exhalation and exhalation into inhalation as a sacrifice using yogic techniques 429 others restrict their diet and offer their inhalations as sacrifice into their inhalations all these people are the knowers of sacrifice and are purified by their sacrifice 430 those who perform selfless service obtain the nectar of selfknowledge as a result of their sacrifice and attain the eternal being o arjuna even this world is not a happy place for the nonsacrificer how can the other world be 431 many types of spiritual disciplines are described in the vedas know them all to be born from karma or the action of body mind and senses knowing this you shall attain nirvana 432 a superior spiritual practice the acquisition and propagation of selfknowledge are superior to any material gain or gift o arjuna because all actions in their entirety culminate in knowledge 433 acquire this spiritual knowledge from a selfrealized guru by humble reverence by sincere inquiry and by service the wise ones who have realized the truth will teach you 434 after knowing the truth o arjuna you shall not again become deluded like this by this knowledge you shall behold the entire creation first within me the supreme being then within your own higher self and then see me alone in everything 435 even if one is the most sinful of all sinners one shall yet cross over the ocean of sin by the raft of selfknowledge 436 as the blazing fire reduces wood to ashes similarly the fire of selfknowledge reduces all bonds of karma or sin to ashes o arjuna 437 spiritual knowledge is revealed to a karmayogi in truth there is no purifier in this world like the true knowledge of the supreme being one who becomes purified by karmayoga discovers this knowledge within naturally in due course of time 438 the one who has faith and is sincere in yogic practices and has control over the senses gains this spiritual knowledge having gained this knowledge one at once attains supreme peace 439 the irrational the faithless and the atheist perish there is neither this world nor the world beyond nor happiness for the disbeliever 440 knowledge karmayoga are needed for nirvana work karma does not bind a person who has renounced work by renouncing attachment to the fruits of work and whose doubts about the self are completely destroyed by selfknowledge o arjuna 441 therefore cut the ignoranceborn doubt about the supreme being abiding in your mind by the sword of selfknowledge resort to karmayoga and get up for the war o arjuna 442 14 international gita society chapter 5 5 path of renunciation arjuna said o krishna you praise spiritual knowledge and also performance of selfless service tell me definitely which one is the better of the two 501 the supreme lord said the path of selfknowledge and the path of selfless service both lead to the supreme goal but of the two selfless service is superior to selfknowledge 502 a person should be considered a true samnyasi renunciant who neither likes nor dislikes one is easily liberated from karmic bondage by becoming free from the pairs of opposites o arjuna 503 both paths lead to the supreme the ignorant not the wise consider the path of selfknowledge or renunciation and the path of selfless service karmayoga as different from each other the person who has truly mastered one gets the benefits of both 504 whatever goal a samnyasi reaches a karmayogi also reaches the same goal therefore the one who sees the path of renunciation and the path of unselfish work as the same really sees 505 but true renunciation o arjuna is difficult to attain without karmayoga a sage equipped with karmayoga quickly attains god 506 a karmayogi whose mind is pure whose mind and senses are under control and who sees one and the same eternal being in all beings is not bound by karma though intensely engaged in work 507 a karmayogi works for god only the wise or samnyasi who knows the truth thinks i do nothing at all in seeing hearing touching smelling eating walking sleeping breathing and speaking giving taking as well as opening and closing the eyes a samnyasi believes that only the senses are operating upon their objects 50809 one who does all work as an offering to the lord abandoning attachment to the results remains untouched by karmic reaction or sin as a lotus leaf never gets wet by water while living in it 510 the karmayogis perform action without attachment with their body mind intellect and senses only for selfpurification 511 a karmayogi attains supreme bliss by abandoning attachment to the fruits of work while others who are attached to the fruits of work become bound by selfish work 512 the path of selfknowledge a person who has completely renounced attachment to the fruits of all works lives happily neither performing nor directing any action 513 the lord neither creates the urge for action nor the feeling of doership nor the attachment to the results of action in people all these are done by the powers of nature 514 the lord does not take the responsibility for the good or evil deeds of bhagavadgita 15 anybody the selfknowledge becomes covered by the veil of ignorance thereby people become deluded and do evil deeds 515 spiritual knowledge destroys the ignorance of the self and reveals the supreme just as the sun reveals the beauty of objects of the world 516 persons whose mind and intellect are totally merged with the source who are firmly devoted to the source who have the source as their supreme goal and sole refuge and whose impurities are destroyed by the knowledge of the source do not take birth again 517 additional marks of an enlightened person an enlightened person by perceiving the lord in all looks at a learned and humble priest an outcast even a cow an elephant or a dog with an equal eye 518 everything has been accomplished in this very life by the one whose mind is set in equality such a person has realized god because god is flawless and impartial 519 one who neither rejoices on obtaining what is pleasant nor grieves on obtaining the unpleasant who has a steady mind who is undeluded and who is a knower of the supreme being such a person eternally abides with the supreme being 520 such a person who is in union with the supreme being becomes unattached to sensual pleasures by discovering the joy of the self through contemplation and enjoys spiritual bliss 521 sensual pleasures are in truth the source of misery and have a beginning and an end therefore the wise do not rejoice sensual pleasures 522 one who is able to withstand the impulse of lust and anger before death is a yogi and a happy person 523 one who finds happiness with the eternal being who rejoices eternal being within and who is illuminated by selfknowledge such a yogi attains nirvana and goes to eternal being 524 seers whose sins or imperfections are destroyed whose doubts have been dispelled by selfknowledge whose minds are disciplined and who are engaged in the welfare of all beings attain the supreme being 525 they who are free from lust and anger who have subdued the mind and senses and who have known the self easily attain nirvana 526 path of meditation and contemplation a sage is liberated by renouncing all material enjoyments focusing the eyes and the mind between the eyebrows equalizing the breath moving through the nostrils by using yogic techniques keeping the senses mind and intellect under control having salvation as the prime goal and by becoming free from lust anger greed and fear 52728 my devotee attains peace by knowing me the supreme being as the enjoyer of sacrifices and austerities as the great lord of all the universe and the friend of all beings 529 chapter 6 16 international gita society 6 path of meditation a karmayogi is also a renunciant the supreme lord said one who performs the prescribed duty without seeking its fruit only for personal enjoyment is a renunciant samnyasi and a karmayogi one does not become samnyasi merely by not lighting the fire and one does not become a yogi merely by abstaining from work 601 o arjuna what they call renunciation samnyasa is also known as karmayoga no one becomes a karmayogi who has not renounced the selfish motive behind an action 602 a definition of yoga and yogi for the wise who seeks to attain yoga of meditation or calmness of mind karmayoga is said to be the means for the one who has attained yoga the calmness becomes the means of selfrealization a person is said to have attained yogic perfection when one has no desire for sensual pleasures or attachment to the fruits of work and has renounced all selfish motives behind any action 60304 mind is both a friend and an enemy one must elevate and not degrade oneself by ones own mind the mind alone is ones friend as well as ones enemy the mind is the friend of those who have control over it and the same mind acts like an enemy for those who do not control it 60506 one who has control over the lower self the mind and senses is tranquil in heat and cold in pleasure and pain and in honor and dishonor and remains ever steadfast with the supreme self 607 a person is called yogi who has both selfknowledge and selfrealization who is calm who has control over the mind and senses and to whom a clod a stone and gold are the same 608 a person is considered superior who is impartial towards companions friends enemies neutrals arbiters haters relatives saints and sinners 609 techniques of meditation a yogi seated in solitude and alone should constantly try to contemplate the supreme being after bringing the mind and senses under control and becoming free from desires and proprietorship 610 one should sit on his or her own firm seat that is neither too high nor too low covered with dry grass a deerskin and a cloth one over the other in a clean spot sitting there in a comfortable position and concentrating the mind on god controlling the thoughts and the activities of the senses one should practice meditation for selfpurification

and fearless practice celibacy have the mind under control think of me and bhagavadgita 17 have me as the supreme goal 61314 thus by always practicing to keep the mind fixed on me the yogi whose mind is subdued attains peace of nirvana and comes to me 615 this yoga is not possible o arjuna for the one who eats too much or who does not eat at all who sleeps too much or who keeps awake 616 but for the one who is moderate in eating recreation working sleeping and waking the yoga of meditation destroys all sorrow 617 a person is said to have achieved yoga the union with the eternal being when the perfectly disciplined mind becomes free from all desires and gets completely united with god in samadhi trance 618 a lamp in a spot sheltered by the eternal being from the wind of desires does not flicker this simile is used for the subdued mind of a yogi practicing meditation on the eternal being 619 when the mind disciplined by the practice of meditation becomes steady one becomes content with the eternal being by beholding him with purified intellect 620 one feels infinite bliss that is perceivable only through the intellect and is beyond the reach of the senses after realizing the eternal being one is never separated from the absolute reality 621 after selfrealization sr one does not regard any other gain superior to sr established in sr one is not moved even by the greatest calamity 622 the state of severance of union with sorrow is called yoga this yoga should be practiced with firm determination and without any mental reservation 623 one gradually attains tranquility of mind by totally abandoning all selfish desires completely restraining the senses from the sense objects by the intellect keeping the mind fully absorbed in the eternal being by means of a welltrained and purified intellect and thinking of me 62425 wheresoever this restless and unsteady mind wanders away during meditation one should just witness it under the supervision of the self 626 who is a yogi supreme bliss comes to a selfrealized yogi whose mind is tranquil whose desires are under control and who is free from sin or faults 627 such a sinless yogi who constantly engages his or her mind and intellect with the eternal being easily enjoys the infinite bliss of contact with god 628 because of perceiving the omnipresent eternal being abiding in all beings and all beings abiding in the eternal being a yogi who is in union with the eternal being sees every being with an equal eye 629 those who perceive me in everything and behold everything in me are not separated from me and i am not separated from them 630 the nondualists who adore me as abiding in all beings abide in me irrespective of their mode of living 631 one is considered the best yogi who regards every being like oneself and who can feel the pain and pleasures of others as ones own o arjuna 632 18 international gita society two methods to subdue the mind arjuna said o krishna you have said that the yoga of meditation is characterized by the calmness of mind but due to restlessness of mind i do not perceive the steady state of mind because the mind indeed is very unsteady turbulent powerful and obstinate o krishna i think restraining the mind is as difficult as restraining the wind 63334 the supreme lord said undoubtedly o arjuna the mind is restless and difficult to restrain but it is subdued by constant vigorous spiritual practice with perseverance selfknowledge and detachment o arjuna 635 in my opinion yoga is difficult for the one whose mind is not subdued however yoga is attainable by the person of subdued mind by striving through proper means 636 destination of unsuccessful yogi arjuna said the faithful who deviates from the path of meditation and fails to attain yogic perfection due to unsubdued mind what is the destination of such a person o krishna 637 does he not perish like a dispersing cloud o krishna having lost both worldly and heavenly pleasures supportless and bewildered on the path of selfrealization 638 o krishna only you are able to completely dispel this doubt of mine because there is none other than you who can dispel this doubt 639 the supreme lord said there is no destruction o arjuna for a yogi either here or hereafter a spiritualist is never put to grief my dear friend 640 the unsuccessful yogi is reborn in the house of the pious and prosperous after attaining heaven and living there for many years or such a yogi is born in a family of enlightened yogis a birth like this is very difficult indeed to obtain in this world 64142 there a yogi regains the knowledge acquired in the previous life and strives again to achieve perfection o arjuna 643 the unsuccessful yogi is instinctively carried towards the eternal being by virtue of the impressions samskara of yogic practices of previous lives even the inquirer of yoga the union with god surpasses those who perform vedic rituals 644 the yogi who diligently strives becomes completely free from all sins or imperfections after gradually perfecting through many incarnations and reaches the supreme abode 645 who is the best yogi the yogi is superior to the ascetics the yogi is superior to the scholars the yogi is superior to the ritualists therefore o arjuna be a yogi 646 i consider the yogidevotee who lovingly contemplates me with supreme faith and whose mind is ever absorbed in me to be the best of all the yogis 647 chapter 7 7 selfknowledge and enlightenment bhagavadgita 19 the supreme lord said o arjuna listen how you shall know me fully without any doubt with your mind absorbed in me taking refuge in me and performing yogic practices 701 i shall impart you selfknowledge together with enlightenment after comprehending that nothing more remains to be known in this world 702 scarcely one out of thousands of persons strives for perfection of selfrealization scarcely one among those successful strivers truly understands me 703 definitions of matter consciousness and spirit the mind intellect ego ether air fire water and earth are the eightfold transformation or division of my material energy prakriti 704 the material energy is my lower nature my other higher nature is spirit purusha by which this entire universe is sustained o arjuna 705 know that all creatures have evolved from this twofold energy and i the supreme being am the source of origin as well as dissolution of the entire universe 706 the supreme spirit is the basis of everything there is nothing higher than me o arjuna everything in the universe is strung on me like jewels are strung on the thread of a necklace 707 o arjuna i am the sapidity in the water i am the radiance in the sun and the moon the sacred syllable om in all the vedas the sound in the ether and potency in human beings i am the sweet fragrance in the earth i am the heat in the fire the life in all living beings and the austerity in the ascetics 70809 o arjuna know me to be the eternal seed of all creatures i am the intelligence of the intelligent and the brilliance of the brilliant i am the strength of the strong that is devoid of lust and attachment i am lust cupid in human beings that is in accord with righteousness dharma for the sacred and sole purpose of procreation after marriage o arjuna 71011 know that three modes gunas of nature goodness passion and ignorance also emanate from me i am not dependent on or affected by the gunas but the gunas are dependent on me 712 human beings are deluded by the various aspects of these three gunas of nature therefore they do not know me who is eternal and above these gunas 713 who seeks god this divine power maya of mine consisting of three modes gunas of nature is very difficult to overcome only those who surrender unto me can easily cross over this maya 714 the evil doers the ignorant the lowest persons who are attached to demonic nature and whose power of discrimination has been taken away by divine illusive power maya do not worship or seek me 715 four types of virtuous ones worship or seek me o arjuna they are the distressed the seeker of selfknowledge the seeker of 20 international gita society wealth and the enlightened one who has experienced the supreme 716 among them the enlightened devotee who is ever united with me and whose devotion is singleminded is the best because i am very dear to the enlightened and the enlightened is also very dear to me 717 all these seekers are indeed noble but i regard the enlightened devotee as my very self one who is steadfast becomes one with me and abides in my supreme abode 718 after many births the enlightened one resorts to me by realizing that everything is indeed my manifestation such a great soul is very rare 719 persons whose judgement has been carried away by various desires impelled by their karmic impression samskara resort to celestial controllers and practice various religious rites 720 god can be seen in any image of worship whosoever desires to worship whatever deity using any name form and method with faith i make their faith steady in that very deity endowed with steady faith they worship that deity and fulfil their wishes through that deity those wishes are indeed granted only by me 72122 such material gains of these less intelligent human beings are temporary the worshipers of celestial controllers go to celestial controllers but my devotees certainly come to me 723 the ignorant ones unable to understand my immutable incomparable incomprehensible and transcendental form assume that i am formless and take form just as humans do 724 concealed by my divine power maya i do not reveal myself to the ignorant ones who do not know and understand my unborn eternal transcendental form and personality and consider me formless 725 i know o arjuna the beings of the past of the present and those of the future but no one really knows me 726 all beings in this world are in utter ignorance due to delusion of pairs of opposites born of likes and dislikes o arjuna but persons of unselfish deeds whose karma or sin has come to an end become free from the delusion of pairs of opposites and worship me with firm resolve 72728 those who strive for freedom from the cycles of birth old age and death by taking refuge in me fully comprehend eternal being the nature of eternal being and karma the power of eternal being 729 the steadfast persons who know me as everything the mortal beings temporal divine beings the supersoul even at the time of death attain me 730 chapter 8 8 the eternal being god arjuna said o krishna who is the eternal being what is the nature of the eternal being what is karma who are the mortal bhagavadgita 21 beings and who are divine beings who is the supersoul and how does he dwell in the body how can you be remembered at the time of death by those who have control over their minds o krishna 80102 definitions of supreme spirit spirit individual soul the supreme lord said the immutable spirit is called eternal being or god the nature including the inherent power of cognition and desire of god is called adhyatma the creative power of god that causes manifestation of living entities is called karma 803 mortal beings are called adhibhuta the expansions of divine personality are called divine beings i am the supersoul residing inside every cell of living beings as the supreme controller o arjuna 804 theory of reincarnation and karma the one who remembers me exclusively even while leaving the body at the time of death attains me there is no doubt about it 805 remembering whatever object one leaves the body at the end of life one attains that object o arjuna because of the constant thought of that object one remembers that object at the end of life and achieves it 806 a simple method of godrealization therefore always remember me and do your duty you shall certainly attain me if your mind and intellect are ever focused on me 807 by contemplating on me with an unwavering mind that is disciplined by the practice of meditation one attains the supreme being o arjuna 808 one who meditates on the supreme being as the omniscient the oldest the controller smaller than the smallest and bigger than the biggest sustainer of everything the inconceivable selfluminous like the sun and beyond material reality at the time of death with steadfast mind and devotion making the flow of bioimpulses life forces prana rise up to the middle of two eye brows or the sixth chakra by the power of yoga and holding there attains the supreme divine person 80910 i shall briefly explain the process to attain the supreme abode that the knowers of the veda call immutable into which the ascetics freed from attachment enter and desiring which people lead a life of celibacy 811 attain salvation by meditating on god when one leaves the physical body by controlling all the senses focusing the mind on god engaged in yogic practice meditating on me and uttering om the sacred monosyllable sound power of eternal being one attains the supreme abode 81213 i am easily attainable o arjuna by that ever steadfast yogi who always thinks of e and whose mind does not go elsewhere 814 after attaining me the great souls do not incur rebirth in this miserable transitory world because they have attained the 22 international gita society highest perfection 815 the dwellers of all the worlds up to and including the world of brahma the creator are subject to the miseries of repeated birth and death but after attaining me o arjuna one does not take birth again 816 everything in the creation is cyclic those who know that the day of the creator brahma lasts one thousand yugas or 432 billion solar years and that his night also lasts one thousand yugas they are the knowers of day and night 817 all manifestations come out of the primary material nature adiprakriti at the arrival of the day of brahma the creative power and they again merge into the same at the coming of brahmas night 818 the same multitude of beings comes into existence again and again at the arrival of the day of the creator brahma and are annihilated inevitably at the arrival of brahmas night 819 there is another eternal existence higher than the changeable material nature prakriti that does not perish when all created beings perish this is called the eternal being this is also said to be the supreme abode those who attain my supreme abode do not take birth again 82021 this supreme abode o arjuna is attainable by unswerving devotion to me within which all beings exist and by which all this universe is pervaded 822 two basic paths of departure after death o arjuna now i shall describe different paths departing by which after death the yogis do or do not come back 823 passing gradually after death through celestial controllers of fire light daytime the bright lunar fortnight and the six months of the northern solstice of the sun yogis who know the self attain supreme abode and do not come back to earth 824 passing gradually after death through celestial controllers of smoke night the dark lunar fortnight and the six months of southern solstice of the sun the righteous person attains heaven and comes back to earth again 825 the path of light of selfknowledge and the path of darkness of ignorance are thought to be the worlds two eternal paths the former leads to salvation mukti nirvana and the latter leads to rebirth 826 spiritual knowledge leads to salvation knowing these two paths o arjuna a yogi is not bewildered at all therefore o arjuna be steadfast in yoga union with me at all times 827 the yogi who knows all this goes beyond getting the benefits of the study of the vedas performance of sacrifices austerities and charities and attains my supreme eternal abode 828 bhagavadgita 23 chapter 9 9 supreme knowledge and the big mystery the supreme lord said i shall reveal to you who do not disbelieve the most profound secret spiritual knowledge together with spiritual experience knowing this you will be freed from the miseries of worldly existence 901 knowledge of the supreme is the biggest mystery this selfknowledge is the king of all knowledge is the most secret is very sacred can be perceived by instinct conforms to righteousness dharma is very easy to practice and is timeless 902 o arjuna those who have no faith in this knowledge do not attain me and follow the cycles of birth and death 903 this entire universe is an expansion of mine all beings depend on me i do not depend on them because i am the highest of all 904 look at the power of my divine mystery in reality i the sustainer and creator of all beings do not depend on them and they also do not depend on me 905 note its like a goldchain depends on gold and milk products depend on milk in fact the goldchain does not depend on gold the chain is nothing but gold similarly matter and energy are different as well as nondifferent perceive that all beings remain in me without any connection or contact as the mighty wind moving everywhere in the sky eternally remains in space 906 the theory of evolution and involution all beings merge into my adiprakriti primary material nature at the end of a cycle of just over 311 trillion solar years o arjuna and i create them again at the beginning of the next cycle 907 i create the entire multitude of beings again and again with the help of my material nature these beings are under control of the three modes of material nature 908 these acts of creation do not bind me o arjuna because i remain indifferent and unattached to those acts 909 the divine kinetic energy maya with the help of material nature creates all animate and inanimate objects under my supervision thus the creation keeps on going o arjuna 910 the ways of the wise and of the ignorant ignorant persons hate me when i appear in human form because they do not know my spiritual nature as the great lord of all beings and take me for an ordinary human they have false hopes false actions false knowledge and delusive qualities see 160418 of fiends and demons and are unable to recognize me 91112 but great souls o arjuna who possess divine qualities see 160103 know me as immutable as both the material and efficient cause of creation and worship me singlemindedly with loving devotion 913 persons of firm resolve worship me with ever 24 international gita society steadfast devotion by always singing my glories striving to attain me and prostrating before me with devotion 914 some worship me by acquiring and propagating selfknowledge others worship the infinite as the one in all or nondual as the master of all or dual and in various other ways 915 everything is a manifestation of god i am the ritual i am the sacrifice i am the offering i am the herb i am the mantra i am the clarified butter i am the fire and i am the oblation i am the supporter of the universe the father the mother and the grandfather i am the object of knowledge the sacred syllable om and also the vedas i am the goal the supporter the lord the witness the abode the refuge the friend the origin the dissolution the foundation the substratum and the immutable seed 91618 i give heat i send as well as withhold the rain i am immortality as well as death i am also both the absolute and the temporal o arjuna 919 the supreme being has become everything attaining salvation by devotional love the performers of rituals prescribed in the vedas the drinkers of the nectar of devotion whose sins are cleansed worship me by doing good deeds for gaining heaven as a result of their meritorious deeds they go to heaven and enjoy celestial sense pleasures 920 they return to the mortal world after enjoying the wide world of heavenly pleasures upon exhaustion of their good karma thus following the ritualistic injunctions of the vedas persons working for the fruit of their actions take repeated birth and death 921 i personally take care of both the material and spiritual welfare of those eversteadfast devotees who always remember and adore me with singleminded contemplation 922 o arjuna even those devotees who worship the deities with faith they also worship me but in an improper way 923 because i the supreme being alone am the enjoyer of all sacrificial services and lord of the universe but people do not know my true spiritual nature therefore they fall into the repeated cycles of birth and death 924 worshippers of the deities go to the deities worshippers of ancestors go to the ancestors and worshippers of the ghosts go to the ghosts but my devotees come to me and are not born again 925 the lord accepts and eats the offering of love whosoever offers me a leaf a flower a fruit or water with devotion i accept and eat the offering of devotion by the purehearted 926 o arjuna whatever you do whatever you eat whatever you offer as oblation to the sacred fire whatever charity you give whatever austerity you perform do all that as an offering unto me 927 you shall become free from the bondage good bhagavadgita 25 and bad of karma by this attitude of complete renunciation samnyasayoga becoming liberated you shall come to me 928 there is no unforgivable sinner the self is present equally in all beings there is no one hateful or dear to me but those who worship me with love and devotion are very close to me and i am also very close to them 929 even if the most sinful person resolves to worship me with singleminded loving devotion such a person must be regarded as a saint because of making the right resolution 930 there are no unforgivable sins or sinners the fire of sincere repentance burns all sins such a person soon becomes righteous and attains everlasting peace be aware o arjuna that my devotee shall never perish or fall down 931 the path of devotional love is easier anybody including women merchants laborers and the evilminded can attain the supreme abode by just surrendering unto my will with loving devotion o arjuna 932 it should then be very easy for holy priests and devout sages to attain the supreme therefore having obtained this joyless and transitory human life one should always worship me with loving devotion 933 fix your mind on me be devoted to me worship me and bow down to me thus uniting yourself with me by setting me as the supreme goal and the sole refuge you shall certainly come to me 934

person you are the ultimate resort of all the universe you are the knower the object of knowledge and the supreme abode the entire universe is pervaded by you o lord of the infinite form 1138 you are the controller of death the fire the wind the water god the moon god and brahma the creator as well as the father of brahma salutations to you a thousand times and again and again salutations to you 1139 my salutations to you from front and from behind o lord my obeisance to you from all sides you are infinite valor and boundless might you pervade everything therefore you are everywhere and in everything 1140 considering you merely as a friend and not knowing your greatness i have inadvertently addressed you as o krishna o yadava o friend etc merely out of affection or carelessness 1141 in whatever way i may have insulted you in jokes while playing reposing in bed sitting or at meals when alone or in front of others o krishna the immeasurable one i implore you for forgiveness 1142 you are the father of this animate and inanimate world and the greatest guru to be worshipped no one is even equal to you in the three worlds how can there be one greater than you o being of incomparable glory 1143 therefore o adorable lord i seek your mercy by bowing down and prostrating my body before you bear with me as a father to his son as a friend to a friend and as a husband to his wife o lord 1144 i am delighted by beholding that which has never been seen before and yet my mind is tormented with fear therefore o god of celestial rulers the refuge of the universe have mercy on me and show me your fourarmed form 1145 one may see god in any form i wish to see you with a crown holding mace and discus in your hand therefore o lord with thousand arms and universal form please appear in the fourarmed form 1146 the supreme lord said o arjuna being pleased with you i have shown you through my own yogic powers this particular supreme shining universal infinite and primal form of mine that has never been seen before by anyone other than you 1147 o arjuna neither bhagavadgita 31 by study of the vedas nor by sacrifice nor by charity nor by rituals nor by severe austerities can i be seen in this cosmic form by anyone other than you in this human world 1148 do not be perturbed and confused by seeing such a terrible form of mine as this with fearless and cheerful mind now behold my fourarmed form 1149 sanjaya said after speaking like this to arjuna lord krishna revealed his fourarmed form and then assuming his pleasant human form lord krishna the great one consoled arjuna who was terrified 1150 arjuna said o krishna seeing this lovely human form of yours i have now become tranquil and i am normal again 1151 god can be seen by devotional love the supreme lord said this fourarmed form of mine that you have seen is very difficult indeed to see even celestial controllers are ever longing to see this form 1152 this fourarmed form of mine that you have just seen cannot be seen even by study of the vedas or by austerity or by acts of charity or by the performance of rituals 1153 however through singleminded devotion alone i can be seen in this form can be known in essence and also can be reached o arjuna 1154 one who dedicates all works to me and to whom i am the supreme goal who is my devotee who has no attachment and is free from enmity towards any being attains me o arjuna 1155 chapter 12 12 path of devotion worship a personal or impersonal god arjuna said which of these has the best knowledge of yoga those eversteadfast devotees who worship you as krishna your personal aspect or those who worship your impersonal aspect the eternal being 1201 the supreme lord said i consider the best yogis to be those eversteadfast devotees who worship with supreme faith by fixing their mind on me as their personal god 1202 they also attain me who worship the unchangeable the inexplicable the invisible the omnipresent the inconceivable the unchanging and the immovable eternal being restraining all the senses even minded under all circumstances and engaged in the welfare of all creatures 120304 reasons for worshipping a personal god selfrealization is more difficult for those who fix their mind on the impersonal unmanifest eternal being because comprehension of the unmanifest by human beings is attained with difficulty 1205 but for those who worship me with unswerving devotion as their personal god offer all actions to me intent on me as the supreme and meditate on me i swiftly become their savior from 32 international gita society the world that is the ocean of death and transmigration whose thoughts are set on my personal form o arjuna 120607 the four paths to god therefore focus your mind on me and let your intellect dwell upon me through meditation and contemplation thereafter you shall certainly attain me 1208 if you are unable to focus your mind steadily on me then long to attain me o arjuna by practice of any other spiritual discipline that suits you 1209 if you are unable even to do any spiritual discipline then be intent on performing all your duty for me you shall attain perfection just by working for me as an instrument just to serve and please me without selfish motives 1210 if you are unable to work for me then just surrender unto my will and renounce the attachment to and anxiety for the fruits of all work with subdued mind by learning to accept all results as gods grace 1211 karmayoga is the best path the knowledge of scriptures is better than mere ritualistic practice meditation is better than scriptural knowledge renunciation of attachment to the fruits of all work is better than meditation peace immediately follows renunciation see more on renunciation in 1802 1809 1212 the attributes of a devotee one who does not hate any creature who is friendly and compassionate free from the notion of i and my evenminded in pain and pleasure forgiving and the yogi who is ever content who has subdued the mind whose resolve is firm whose mind and intellect are engaged in dwelling upon me who is devoted to me is dear to me 121314 the one by whom others are not agitated and who is not agitated by others who is free from joy envy fear and anxiety is also dear to me 1215 one who is desireless pure wise impartial and free from anxiety who has renounced the doership in all undertakingssuch a devotee is dear to me 1216 one who neither rejoices nor grieves neither likes nor dislikes who has renounced both the good and the evil and is full of devotionis dear to me 1217 the one who remains the same towards friend or foe in honor or disgrace in heat or cold in pleasure or pain who is free from attachment who is indifferent to censure or praise quiet content with whatever one has unattached to a place a country or a house calm and full of devotion that person is dear to me 121819 one should sincerely try to develop divine qualities but those faithful devotees are very dear to me who set me as their supreme goal and followor just sincerely try to develop the above mentioned nectar of moral values 1220 chapter 13 13 creation and the creator bhagavadgita 33 the theory of creation the supreme lord said o arjuna this physical body a miniature universe may be called the creation one who knows the creation is called the creator by the seers of truth 1301 o arjuna know me to be the creator of all the creation the true understanding of both the creator and the creation is considered by me to be the spiritual or metaphysical knowledge 1302 what the creation is what its like what its transformations are where its source is who that creator is and what his powers are hear all these from me in brief 1303 the seers have separately described the creation and the creator in different ways in the vedic hymns and also in the conclusive and convincing verses of the brahmasutra 1304 the primary material nature cosmic intellect i consciousness or ego five basic elements ten organs mind five sense objects and desire hatred pleasure pain the physical body consciousness and resolve thus the entire field has been briefly described with its transformations 130506 the fourfold noble truth as means of nirvana humility modesty nonviolence forgiveness honesty service to guru purity of thought word and deed steadfastness selfcontrol and aversion towards sense objects absence of ego constant reflection on pain and suffering inherent in birth old age disease and death 130708 detached attachment with family members home etc unfailing calmness upon attainment of the desirable and the undesirable and unswerving devotion to me through singleminded contemplation taste for solitude distaste for social gatherings and gossips steadfastness in acquiring the knowledge of eternal being and seeing the omnipresent supreme being everywhere this is said to be knowledge that which is contrary to this is ignorance 130911 god can be described by parables only i shall fully describe the object of knowledge knowing which one attains immortality the beginningless supreme being is said to be neither eternal sat nor temporal asat 1312 the eternal being has his hands feet eyes head mouth and ears everywhere because he is allpervading and omnipresent 1313 he is the perceiver of all sense objects without the physical sense organs unattached and yet the sustainer of all devoid of three modes of material nature and yet the enjoyer of the modes of material nature by becoming a living entity 1314 he is inside as well as outside all beings animate and inanimate he is incomprehensible because of his subtlety and because of his omnipresence he is very near residing in ones inner psyche as well as far away in his supreme abode 1315 he is undivided and yet appears to exist as if divided in beings he the object of knowledge 34 international gita society appears as brahma the creator vishnu the sustainer and shiva the destroyer of all beings 1316 the supreme person is the source of all light he is said to be beyond darkness of ignorance he is the selfknowledge the object of selfknowledge and seated in the inner psyche as consciousness of all beings he is to be realized by selfknowledge 1317 thus the creation as well as the knowledge and the object of knowledge have been briefly described by me understanding this my devotee attains the supreme abode 1318 a description of the supreme spirit spirit and jiva know that both the material nature and the spiritual being are beginningless all manifestations and three states of mind and matter called modes or gunas are born of prakriti prakriti is said to be the cause of production of the physical body and the eleven organs of perception and action purusha consciousness spirit is said to be the cause of experiencing pleasure and pain 131920 purusha enjoys three modes of material nature prakriti by associating with prakriti attachment to the gunas due to ignorance caused by previous karma is the cause of birth of living entity jiva in good and evil wombs 1321 eternal being god spirit in the body is also called the witness the guide the supporter the enjoyer the great lord and also the supreme self 1322 they who truly understand spiritual being purusha and the material nature prakriti with its three modes gunas are not born again regardless of their way of life 1323 some perceive the supersoul in their inner psyche through mind and intellect that have been purified either by meditation or by metaphysical knowledge or by karmayoga 1324 the faith alone can lead to nirvana others however do not know the yoga of meditation knowledge and work but they perform deity worship with faith as mentioned in the scriptures by the saints and sages they also transcend death by virtue of their firm faith in what they have heard 1325 whatever is born animate or inanimate know them to be born from the union of the matter and spirit o arjuna 1326 the one who sees the same eternal supreme lord dwelling as spirit equally within all mortal beings truly sees 1327 because of beholding one and the same lord existing equally in every being one does not injure anybody and thereupon attains the supreme abode 1328 one who perceives that all works are done by the powers gunas of material nature prakriti alone and thus does not consider oneself as the doer that person truly understands 1329 the moment one discovers the diverse variety of beings and their ideas abiding in the source and coming out from him alone one attains the supreme being 1330 attributes of the spirit bhagavadgita 35 because of being beginningless and unaffectable by the three modes of material nature the eternal supersoul even though dwelling in the body as a living entity neither does anything nor becomes tainted o arjuna 1331 just as the allpervading space is not tainted because of its subtlety similarly spirit abiding in all bodies is not tainted 1332 just as one sun illuminates the entire world similarly eternal being illumines or gives life to the entire creation o arjuna 1333 they attain the supreme who perceive the difference between body and spirit with the eye of selfknowledge and know the techniques by using any one of the five paths selfless service knowledge devotion meditation and surrender of liberation of the living entity jiva from the trap of divine illusory energy maya 1334 chapter 14 14 three modes gunas of nature the supreme lord said i shall further explain to you that supreme knowledge the best of all knowledge knowing which all the sages have attained supreme perfection after this life 1401 they who have taken refuge in this spiritual knowledge attain unity with me and are neither born at the time of creation nor afflicted at the time of dissolution 1402 beings are born from the union of spirit and matter my material nature is the womb of creation wherein i place the seed of consciousness from which all beings are born o arjuna 1403 whatever forms are produced in all different wombs o arjuna the material nature is their bodygiving mother and i am the lifegiving father 1404 how three modes of material nature bind us sattva or goodness rajas or passion activity and tamas or ignorance inertia these three modes ropes gunas of material nature prakriti fetter the eternal individual soul to the body o arjuna 1405 of these the mode of goodness is illuminating and good because it is pure it fetters the living entity by attachment to happiness and knowledge o sinless arjuna 1406 know that the mode of passion is characterized by intense craving and is the source of desire and attachment it binds the living entity by attachment to the fruits of work 1407 know o arjuna that the mode of ignorance the deluder of living entity is born of inertia it binds the living entity by carelessness laziness and excessive sleep 1408 o arjuna the mode of goodness attaches one to happiness of learning and knowing the eternal being the mode of passion attaches to intense action and the mode of ignorance attaches to inaction laziness by covering selfknowledge 1409 characteristics of three modes of nature 36 international gita society goodness prevails by suppressing passion and ignorance passion prevails by suppressing goodness and ignorance and ignorance prevails by suppressing goodness and passion o arjuna 1410 when the light of selfknowledge illuminates all the senses in the body then it should be known that goodness is predominant 1411 o arjuna when passion is predominant greed activity undertaking of selfish work restlessness excitement etc arise 1412 o arjuna when inertia is predominant ignorance inactivity carelessness delusion etc arise 1413 three modes are also the vehicles of transmigration one who dies when goodness dominates goes to heaven the pure world of knowers of the supreme 1414 one who dies when passion dominates is reborn attached to action or the utilitarian type one who dies in ignorance is reborn as a lower creature 1415 the fruit of good action is said to be beneficial and pure the fruit of passionate action is pain and the fruit of ignorant action is laziness 1416 selfknowledge arises from the mode of goodness greed arises from the mode of passion and negligence delusion and slowness of mind arise from the mode of ignorance 1417 they who are established in goodness go to heaven passionate persons are reborn in the mortal world and the ignorant abiding in the lowest mode of ignorance go to lower planets or hell or take birth as lower creatures 1418 attain nirvana after rising above three modes when visionaries perceive no doer other than the three modes of material nature and know the supreme which is above and beyond these modes then they attain salvation mukti 1419 when one rises above the three modes of material nature that originate in the body one attains immortality or salvation mukti and is freed from the pains of birth old age and death 1420 the process of rising above three modes arjuna said what are the marks of those who have transcended the three modes of material nature and what is their conduct how does one transcend these three modes of material nature o lord krishna 1421 the supreme lord said one is said to have transcended the modes of material nature who neither hates the presence of enlightenment activity and delusion nor desires for them when they are absent who remains like a witness without being affected by the modes of material nature who stays firmly attached to the lord without wavering thinking that only the modes of material nature are operating 142223 and one who depends on the lord and is indifferent to pain and pleasure to whom a clod a stone and gold are alike to whom the dear and the unfriendly are alike who is of firm mind who is calm in censure bhagavadgita 37 and in praise and indifferent to honor and disgrace who is impartial to friend and foe and who has given up the sense of doership and ownership 142425 bonds of three modes can be cut by devotional love one who offers service to me with love and unswerving devotion rises above three modes of material nature and becomes fit for nirvana 1426 because i am the basis of the immortal eternal being of everlasting order dharma and of the absolute bliss 1427 chapter 15 15 the supreme being creation is like a tree created by of maya the supreme lord said sages speak of the eternal banyan tree that has its origin or root above in the supreme being and branches below in the cosmos and whose leaves are the vedic hymns one who understands this tree is a knower of the vedas 1501 the branches of this cosmic tree of maya illusion spread all over the cosmos the tree is nourished by three modes of material nature sense pleasures are its sprouts and its roots of ego attachment and desire stretch below in the human world causing karmic bondage 1502 cut the tree of attachment to attain salvation the real form of this tree is not perceptible here on earth nor is its beginning end or existence having cut the firm roots the ego and desires of this tree by the mighty ax of selfknowledge and detachment thus thinking i take refuge in that very primal person from whom this primal manifestation comes forth seek that supreme abode from where one does not come back to the mortal world again 150304 the wise reach that eternal goal who are free from pride and delusion who have conquered the evil of attachment who constantly dwell in the supreme self with all desires completely stilled and who are free from dualities of pleasure and pain 1505 the sun does not illumine my supreme abode nor does the moon nor the fire having reached there people attain permanent liberation mukti and do not come back to this temporal world again 1506 the embodied soul is the enjoyer the eternal individual soul in the body of living beings is indeed my integral part it associates with the six sensory faculties of perception including the mind and activates them 1507 just as the air takes aroma away from the flower similarly the individual soul takes the six sensory faculties from the physical body it casts off during death to the new physical body it acquires in reincarnation by the power of karma 1508 the living entity jiva 38 international gita society enjoys sense pleasures using six sensory faculties of hearing touch sight taste smell and mind the ignorant cannot perceive jiva departing from the body nor staying in the body and enjoying sense pleasures by associating with the modes of material nature but those who have the eye of selfknowledge can see it 150910 the yogis striving for perfection behold the living entity jiva abiding in their inner psyche as consciousness but the ignorant and those whose inner psyche is not pure even though striving do not perceive him 1511 spirit is the essence of everything know that light energy to be mine that comes from the sun and illumines the whole world and is in the moon and in fire 1512 note the light of the sun is a reflection of his radiance rv 100703 the knowers of the supreme being visualize everywhere in themselves in every human being and in the whole universe that supreme cluster of light which is the source of the visible world entering the earth i support all beings with my energy becoming the sapgiving moon i nourish all the plants 1513 becoming the digestive fire i remain in the body of all living beings uniting with vital life forces i digest all types of food 1514 and i am seated in the inner psyche of all beings memory selfknowledge and removal of doubts and wrong notions about the eternal being by reasoning or in trance samadhi come from me i am to be known by the study of all the vedas i am indeed the author of the vedanta and the knower of the vedas 1515 supreme spirit spirit and the created beings there are two entities in the cosmos the temporal divine beings and the unchangeable eternal being all created beings are subject to change but the eternal being does not change 1516 the supreme being is beyond both the temporal divine beings and the eternal being he is also called the absolute reality god the source who sustains both the temporal and the eternal by pervading everything 1517 because i am beyond both the temporal and the eternal therefore i am known in this world and in the vedas as the supreme being 1518 the wise who truly understand me as the supreme being know everything and worship me wholeheartedly o arjuna 1519 thus i have explained this most secret science of selfknowledge o sinless arjuna having understood this one becomes enlightened ones all duties are accomplished and the goal of human life is achieved o arjuna 1520 chapter 16 16 divine and the demonic qualities a list of divine qualities to be cultivated bhagavadgita 39 the supreme lord said fearlessness purity of the inner psyche perseverance in the yoga of selfknowledge charity senserestraint sacrifice study of the scriptures austerity honesty nonviolence truthfulness absence of anger renunciation calmness abstinence from malicious talk compassion for all creatures freedom from greed gentleness modesty absence of fickleness splendor forgiveness fortitude cleanliness absence of malice and absence of pride these are the twentysix qualities of those endowed with divine virtues o arjuna 160103 a list of demonic qualities to be given up o arjuna the marks of those who are born with demonic qualities are hypocrisy arrogance pride anger harshness and ignorance 1604 divine qualities lead to salvation moksha the demonic qualities are said to be for bondage do not grieve o arjuna you are born with divine qualities 1605 there are only two types of human beings basically there are only two types of human beings in this world the divine and the demonic the divine has been described at length now hear from me about the demonic o arjuna 1606 persons of demonic nature do not know what to do and what not to do they have neither purity nor good conduct nor truthfulness 1607 they say that the world is unreal without a substratum without god and without an order the world is caused by sexual union of man and woman alone and nothing else 1608 adhering to this wrong atheistic view these degraded souls with small intellect and cruel deeds are born as enemies for the destruction of the world 1609 filled with insatiable desires hypocrisy pride and arrogance holding wrong views due to delusion they act with impure motives 1610 obsessed with endless anxiety lasting until death considering sense gratification their highest aim and convinced that sense pleasure is everything 1611 bound by hundreds of ties of desire and enslaved by lust and anger they strive to obtain wealth by unlawful means to fulfill sensual pleasures they think 1612 this has been gained by me today i shall fulfill this desire i have this much wealth and will have more wealth in the future 1613 that enemy has been slain by me and i shall slay others also i am the lord i am the enjoyer i am successful powerful and happy 1614 i am rich and born in a noble family who is equal to me i shall perform sacrifice i shall give charity and i shall rejoice 1615 thus deluded by ignorance bewildered by many fancies entangled in the net of delusion addicted to the enjoyment of sensual pleasures they fall into a foul hell 1616 selfconceited stubborn filled with pride and intoxication of wealth they perform sacrifice charity etc only in name for show and not according to 40 international gita society scriptural injunction 1617 these malicious people cling to egoism power arrogance lust anger greed hatred and they deny my presence in their own body and in others bodies 1618 suffering is the destiny of the ignorant i hurl these haters cruel sinful and mean people into the cycles of rebirth in the womb of demons again and again 1619 o arjuna entering the wombs of demons birth after birth the deluded ones sink to the lowest hell without ever attaining me 1620 lust anger and greed are the three gates to hell lust anger and greed are the three gates of hell leading to the bondage of the individual therefore one must learn to give up these three 1621 one who is liberated from these three gates of hell o arjuna does what is best and consequently attains the supreme abode 1622 one must follow the scripture one who acts under the influence of ones desires disobeying scriptural injunctions neither attains perfection nor happiness nor the supreme abode 1623 therefore let the scripture be your authority in determining what should be done and what should not be done you should perform your duty following the scriptural injunction 1624 chapter 17 17 threefold faith arjuna said what is the mode of devotion of those who perform spiritual practices with faith but without following the scriptural injunctions o krishna is it in the mode of goodness passion or ignorance 1701 three types of faith the supreme lord said the natural faith of embodied beings is of three kinds goodness passion and ignorance now hear about these from me 1702 o arjuna the faith of each is in accordance with ones own natural disposition governed by karmic impressions one is known by ones faith one can become whatever one wants to be if one constantly contemplates the object of desire with faith 1703 persons in the mode of goodness worship celestial controllers those in the mode of passion worship supernatural rulers and demons and those in the mode of ignorance worship ghosts and spirits 1704 ignorant persons of demonic nature are those who practice severe austerities without following the prescription of the scriptures who are full of hypocrisy and egotism who are impelled by the force of desire and attachment and who senselessly torture the elements in their body and also me who dwells within the body 170506 three types of food the food preferred by all of us is also of three types so are the sacrifice austerity and charity now hear the distinction between bhagavadgita 41 them 1707 the foods that promote longevity virtue strength health happiness and joy are juicy smooth substantial and nutritious such foods are liked by persons in the mode of goodness 1708 people in the mode of passion like foods that are very bitter sour salty hot pungent dry and burning and cause pain grief and disease 1709 people in the mode of ignorance like foods that are stale tasteless putrid rotten refuse impure such as meat and alcohol 1710 three types of sacrifices selfless service enjoined by the scriptures and performed without a desire for the fruit with a firm belief and conviction that it is ones duty is in the mode of goodness 1711 selfless service that is performed only for show and aiming for fruit is in the mode of passion o arjuna 1712 selfless service that is performed without following the scripture in which no food is distributed which is devoid of mantra faith and gift is said to be in the mode of ignorance 1713 austerity of thought word and deed the worship of celestial controllers the priest the guru and the wise purity honesty celibacy and nonviolence these are said to be austerity of deed 1714 speech that is nonoffensive truthful pleasant beneficial and is used for the regular study of scriptures is called the austerity of word 1715 serenity of mind gentleness calmness selfcontrol and purity of thought these are called austerity of thought 1716 three types of austerity the above mentioned threefold austerity of thought word and deed practiced by yogis with supreme faith without a desire for the fruit is said to be in the mode of goodness 1717 austerity that is performed for gaining respect honor reverence and for the sake of show yielding an uncertain and temporary result is said to be in the mode of passion 1718 austerity performed with foolish stubbornness or with selftorture or for harming others is said to be in the mode of ignorance 1719 three types of charity charity that is given at the right place and time as a matter of duty to a deserving candidate who does nothing in return is considered to be in the mode of goodness 1720 charity that is given unwillingly or to get something in return or to gain some fruit is said to be in the mode of passion 1721 charity that is given at a wrong place and time to unworthy persons or without paying respect to the receiver or with ridicule is said to be in the mode of ignorance 1722 threefold name of god om tat sat is said to be the threefold name of god in sanskrit persons with good qualities the vedas and selfless service 42 international gita society were created by god in the ancient time 1723 therefore acts of sacrifice charity and austerity prescribed in the scriptures are always commenced by uttering om by the knowers of the supreme being 1724 various types of sacrifice charity and austerity are performed by the seekers of salvation by uttering tat or he is all without seeking a reward 1725 the word sat is used in the sense of reality and goodness the word sat is also used for an auspicious act o arjuna 1726 faith in sacrifice charity and austerity is also called sat selfless service for the sake of the supreme is in truth termed as sat 1727 whatever is done without faith whether it is sacrifice charity austerity or any other act is called asat it has no value here or hereafter o arjuna 1728 chapter 18 18 attaining liberation by giving up ego arjuna said i wish to know the nature of renunciation samnyasa and sacrifice tyaga and the difference between the two o lord krishna 1801 definition of renunciation and sacrifice the supreme lord said the sages call renunciation the complete renunciation of work for any personal profit the wise define sacrifice as the sacrifice of and the freedom from attachment to the fruits of all work 1802 some philosophers say that all work is full of faults and should be given up while others say that acts of sacrifice charity and austerity should not be abandoned 1803 o arjuna listen to my conclusion about sacrifice sacrifice is said to be of three types 1804 acts of service charity and austerity should not be abandoned but should be performed because service charity and austerity are the purifiers of the wise 1805 even these obligatory works should be performed without attachment to the fruits this is my definite supreme advice o arjuna 1806 three types of sacrifice giving up ones duty is not proper the abandonment of obligatory work is due to delusion and is declared to be in the mode of ignorance 1807 one who abandons duty merely because it is difficult or because of fear of bodily affliction does not get the benefits of sacrifice by performing such a sacrifice in the mode of passion 1808 obligatory work performed as duty renouncing attachment to the fruit is alone to be regarded as sacrifice in the mode of goodness o arjuna 1809 one who neither hates a disagreeable work nor is attached to an agreeable work is considered a sacrificer tyagi imbued with the mode of goodness intelligent and free from all doubts about the supreme being 1810 human beings cannot completely abstain from work therefore bhagavadgita 43 one who completely renounces attachment to the fruits of all work is considered a tyagi 1811 the threefold fruit of works desirable undesirable and mixed accrues after death to the one who is not a tyagi but never to a tyagi 1812 five causes of an action learn from me o arjuna the five causes as described in the samkhya doctrine for the accomplishment of all actions they are the physical body the seat of karma the modes of material nature the doer the eleven organs of perception and action the instruments various life forces and the fifth is ones fate 181314 these are the five causes of whatever action whether right or wrong one performs by thought word and deed 1815 therefore the ignorant who consider ones body or the soul as the sole agent do not understand due to imperfect knowledge 1816 one who is free from the notion of doership and whose intellect is not polluted by the desire to reap the fruit even after slaying all these people neither slays nor is bound by the act of killing 1817 the subject the object and the knowledge of the object are the threefold driving force or impetus to an action the eleven organs of perception and action the act and the modes of nature are the three components of action 1818 three types of spiritual knowledge selfknowledge action and agent are said to be of three types according to the guna theory hear duly about these also 1819 the knowledge by which one sees a single immutable reality in all beings as undivided in the divided such knowledge is in the mode of goodness 1820 the knowledge by which one sees different realities of various types among all beings as separate from one another such knowledge is in the mode of passion 1821 the irrational baseless and worthless knowledge by which one clings to one single effect such as the body as if it is everything such knowledge is declared to be in the mode of darkness or ignorance 1822 three types of action obligatory duty performed without likes and dislikes and without selfish motives and attachment to enjoy the fruit is said to be in the mode of goodness 1823 action performed with ego with selfish motives and with too much effort is in the mode of passion 1824 action that is undertaken because of delusion disregarding consequences loss injury to others as well as ones own ability is said to be in the mode of ignorance 1825 three types of person a person who is free from attachment is nonegotistic endowed with resolve and enthusiasm and unperturbed in success or failure is called good 1826 a person who is impassioned who desires the fruits of work who is greedy violent impure and 44 international gita society gets affected by joy and sorrow is called passionate 1827 a person who is undisciplined vulgar stubborn wicked malicious lazy depressed and procrastinating is called ignorant 1828 three types of intellect now hear me explain fully and separately o arjuna the threefold division of intellect and resolve based on modes of material nature 1829 o arjuna that intellect is in the mode of goodness which understands the path of work and the path of renunciation right and wrong action fear and fearlessness bondage and liberation 1830 that intellect is in the mode of passion which cannot distinguish between righteousness and unrighteousness and right and wrong action o arjuna 1831 that intellect is in the mode of ignorance which when covered by ignorance accepts unrighteousness as righteousness and thinks everything to be that which it is not o arjuna 1832 three types of resolve four goals of human life that resolve is in the mode of goodness by which one manipulates the functions of the mind prana bioimpulses life forces and senses for godrealization only o arjuna 1833 that resolve is in the mode of passion by which one craving for the fruits of work clings to duty earning wealth and pleasure with great attachment 1834 that resolve is in the mode of ignorance by which a dull person does not give up sleep fear grief despair and carelessness o arjuna 1835 three types of pleasure and now hear from me o arjuna about the threefold pleasure the pleasure that one enjoys from spiritual practice results in cessation of all sorrows 1836 the pleasure that appears as poison in the beginning but is like nectar in the end comes by the grace of selfknowledge and is in the mode of goodness 1837 sensual pleasures that appear as nectars in the beginning but become poison in the end are in the mode of passion 1838 pleasure that confuses a person in the beginning and in the end as a result of sleep laziness and carelessness is in the mode of ignorance 1839 there is no being either on the earth or among the celestial controllers in the heaven who can remain free from these three modes of material nature 1840 division of labor is based on ones ability the division of labor into four categories is also based on the qualities inherent in peoples nature and not necessarily as ones birth right o arjuna 1841 intellectuals who have serenity selfcontrol austerity purity patience honesty spiritual knowledge spiritual experience and belief in god are labeled as intellectuals brahmans 1842 those having the qualities of heroism vigor firmness dexterity steadfastness in battle charity and administrative skills are called kshatriyas or warriors 1843 those who bhagavadgita 45 are good at cultivation cattle rearing business trade and industry are known as vaishyas merchants those who are very good in service and labor type work are classed as laborers 1844 attain salvation by duty discipline devotion one can attain the highest perfection by devotion to ones natural work listen to me how one attains perfection while engaged in ones natural work 1845 one attains perfection by worshipping the supreme beingfrom whom all beings originate and by whom all this universe is pervaded through performance of ones natural duty for him 1846 ones inferior natural work is better than superior unnatural work even though well performed one who does the work ordained by ones inherent nature without selfish motives incurs no sin or karmic bondage 1847 ones natural work even though defective should not be abandoned because all undertakings are enveloped by defects as fire is covered by smoke o arjuna 1848 the person whose mind is always free from attachment who has subdued the mind and senses and who is free from desires attains the supreme perfection of freedom from the bondage of karma by renouncing attachment to the fruits of work 1849 learn from me briefly o arjuna how one who has attained such perfection the freedom from the bondage of karma attains the supreme person the goal of spiritual knowledge 1850 endowed with purified intellect subduing the mind with firm resolve turning away from sound and other objects of the senses giving up likes and dislikes living in solitude eating lightly controlling the mind speech and organs of action ever absorbed in yoga of meditation taking refuge in detachment and relinquishing egotism violence pride lust anger and proprietorship one becomes peaceful free from the notion of i and my and fit for attaining oneness with the supreme being 185153 absorbed in the supreme being the serene one neither grieves nor desires becoming impartial to all beings one obtains my parabhakti the highest devotional love 1854 by devotion one truly understands what and who i am in essence having known me in essence one immediately merges with me 1855 a karmayogi attains the eternal immutable abode by my grace even while doing all duties just by dedicating all action to me with loving devotion 1856 sincerely offer all actions to me set me as your supreme goal and completely depend on me always fix your mind on me and resort to karmayoga 1857 when your mind becomes fixed on me you shall overcome all difficulties by my grace but if you do not listen to me due to ego you shall perish 1858 karmic bondage and the free will 46 international gita society if due to ego you think i shall not fight your resolve is vain because your own nature will compel you to fight 1859 o arjuna you are controlled by your own natureborn karmic impressions or samskara therefore you shall do even against your will what you do not wish to do out of delusion 1860 the supreme lord krishna or god abiding as the controller in the inner psyche of all beings o arjuna causes them to evolve or work out their karma like a puppet of karma mounted on a machine 1861 the supreme controller is the reflection of the supreme spirit in the body the supreme lord organizes controls supervises and directs everything in the universe human being is like a puppet of karma mounted on a body which is the vehicle of transmigration the word evolve refers to working out ones karma thus we become the puppet of our own karma created by our free will the lord has made karmic laws as the controller of all living beings therefore one must learn to gladly endure all that fate imposes by taking refuge in god and following his commandments vedas declare that the lord using his law of karma makes us dance as a juggler would make his monkey dance without the laws of karma the scriptural injunctions prohibitions as well as selfeffort would have no value at all karma is the eternal justice and the eternal law as a result of the working of eternal justice there can be no escape from the consequences of our deeds we become the product of our own past thinking and action therefore we must think and act wisely at the present moment using the scriptures as a guide the doctrine of karma and reincarnation is also found in the following two verses of the koran allah is he who created you and then sustained you then causes you to die then gives life to you again surah 3040 he may reward those who believe and do good works no one is able to escape his law of consequences surah 3045 people cannot escape from the consequences of their deeds for as we sow so we reap cause and effect cannot be separated because the effect exists in the cause as the fruit exists in the seed good and evil deeds follow us continually like our shadows the bible also says whosoever shedeth mans blood by man shall his blood be shed genesis 906 it is believed that all references to karma and reincarnation were taken out of the bible during the second century with the noble aim of encouraging people to strive hard for perfection during this very life those who believe in reincarnation must avoid laziness and procrastination stress intense spiritual discipline and try their best to get self bhagavadgita 47 realization in this very life as if there were no reincarnation live as though this is your last day on this earth one cannot achieve anything through laziness and procrastination seek refuge in the supreme lord alone with loving devotion o arjuna by his grace you shall attain supreme peace and the eternal abode 1862 thus i have explained the knowledge that is more secret than the secret after fully reflecting on this do as you wish 1863 path of surrender is the ultimate path to god hear once again my most secret supreme word you are very dear to me therefore i shall tell this for your benefit 1864 fix your mind on me be devoted to me offer service to me bow down to me and you shall certainly reach me i promise you because you are my very dear friend 1865 setting aside doership ownership and attachment to the fruits of all works just surrender to or gladly abide by my will i shall liberate you from all sins or bondage of karma do not grieve 1866 the meaning of abandoning all duties and taking refuge in god is that one should perform duty without ego and attachment to results as an offering to the lord and totally depend only on him the lord takes full responsibility for a person who totally depends on him and understands all is manifestation of the one the highest service to god and the best charity this knowledge should never be spoken by you to one who is devoid of austerity who is without devotion who does not desire to listen or who speaks ill of me 1867 to speak of wisdom to a deluded person to glorify sacrifice to a greedy person to advise sense control to an irascible person and to discourse on lord ramas exploits to a lecher is as useless as sowing seed on barren ground it is not for any soul to believe save by the permission of allah you should not compel one to believe surah 10100101 anyone to whom allah has not granted the light of knowledge will have no light surah 2440 the study of gita or any other scripture is meant only for sincere persons according to ramakrishna one can understand him as much as he makes one understand guru nanak said o beloved only they to whom you give the divine knowledge obtain it the one who shall propagate or help the propagation of this supreme secret philosophy of the gita amongst devotees shall be performing the highest devotional service to me and shall certainly come to me 1868 no other person shall do a more pleasing service to me and no one on the earth shall be dearer to me 1869 the grace of the gita those who shall study our sacred dialogue shall be performing a holy act of knowledgesacrifice this is my promise 1870 whoever hears or reads this sacred dialogue in the form of the gita

to body and spirit is dispelled and i shall obey your command 1873 sanjaya said thus i heard this wonderful dialogue between lord krishna and arjuna causing my hair to stand on end 1874 by the grace of guru sage vyasa i heard this most secret and supreme yoga directly from krishna the lord of yoga himself speaking to arjuna before my very eyes of clairvoyance granted by sage vyasa 1875 o king by
