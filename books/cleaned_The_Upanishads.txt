tue translators idea of rendering the upanishads into clear simple english ac cessible to occidental readers had its origin in a visit paid to a boston friend in 1909 the gentleman then battling with a fatal malady took from his library shelf a trans lation of the upanishads and opening it expressed deep regret that the obscure and unfamiliar form shut from him what he felt to be profound and vital teaching the desire to unlock the closed doors of this ancient treasure house awakened at that time led to a series of classes on the upanishads at the vedanta centre of boston during its early days in st botolph street the translation and commentary then given were transcribed and after studious revision were published in the centres monthly magazine the message of the east in 1913 and 1914 still further revision has brought it to its present form 8 preface so far as was consistent with a faithful rendering of the sanskrit text the swami throughout his translation has sought to eliminate all that might seem obscure and confusing to the modern mind while retaining in remarkable measure the rhythm and archaic force of the lines he has tried not to sacrifice directness and simplicity of style where he has been obliged to use the sanskrit term for lack of an exact english equivalent he has invariably inter preted it by a familiar english word in brackets and everything has been done to remove the sense of strangeness in order that the occidental reader may not feel himself an alien in the new regions of thought opened to him even more has the swami striven to keep the letter subordinate to the spirit any scripture is only secondarily an historical document to treat it as an object of mere intellectual curiosity is to cheat the world of its deeper message if mankind is to derive the highest benefit from a study of it its appeal must be primarily to the spiritual consciousness and one of the salient merits of the present translation lies preface 9 in this that the translator approaches his task not only with the grave concern of the careful scholar but also with the profound reverence and fervor of the true devotee epiror boston march 1919 contents page introduction 26 13 isaupanishad 56 25 kathaupanishad 390 introduction tue upanishads represent the loftiest heights of ancient indoaryan thought and culture they form the wisdom portion or gndnaknda of the vedas as con trasted with the karmaknda or sacri ficial portion in each of the four great vedas known as rik yajur s4ma and atharva there is a large portion which deals predominantly with rituals and cere monials and which has for its aim to show man how by the path of right action he may prepare himself for higher attainment fol lowing this in each veda is another portion called the upanishad which deals wholly with the essentials of philosophic discrimi nation and ultimate spiritual vision for this reason the upanishads are known as the vednta that is the end or final goal of wisdom veda wisdom ana end the name upanishad has been variously interpreted many claim that it is a com pound sanskrit word upanishad signi 14 introduction fying sitting at the feet or in the presence of a teacher while according to other authorities it means to shatter or to destroy the fetters of ignorance what ever may have been the technical reason for selecting this name it was chosen un doubtedly to give a picture of aspiring seekers approaching some wise seer in the seclusion of an himdlayan forest in order to learn of him the profoundest truths regarding the cosmic universe and god because these teachings were usually given in the stillness of some distant retreat where the noises of the world could not disturb the tranquillity of the contemplative life they are known also as aranyakas forest books another reason for this name may be found in the fact that they were intended especially for the vna prasthas those who having fulfilled all their duties in the world had retired to the forest to devote themselves to spiritual study the form which the teaching naturally assumed was that of dialogue a form later adopted by plato and other greek philoso phers as nothing was written and all introduction 15 instruction was transmitted orally the upanishads are called srutis what is heard the term was also used in the sense of revealed the upanishads being regarded as direct revelations of god while the smritis minor scriptures re corded through memory were traditional works of purely human origin it is a significant fact that nowhere in the upan ishads is mention made of any author or recorder i no date for the origin of the upanishads can be fixed because the written text does not limit their antiquity the word sruti makes that clear to us the teaching probably existed ages before it was set down in any written form the text itself bears evidence of this because not in frequently in a dialogue between teacher and disciple the teacher quotes from earlier scriptures now unknown to us as pro fessor max miiller states in his lectures on the vednta philosophy one feels certain that behind all these lightningflashes of religious and philosophic thought there is a distant past a dark background of which we shall never know the beginning some 16 introduction scholars place the vedic period as far back as 4000 or 5000 bc others from 2000 to 1400 bc but even the most conservative admit that it antedates by several cen turies at least the buddhistic period which begins in the sixth century bc the value of the upanishads however does not rest upon their antiquity but upon the vital message they contain for all times and all peoples there is nothing pecu liarly racial or local in them the en nobling lessons of these scriptures are as practical for the modern world as they were for the indoaryans of the earliest vedic age their teachings are summed up in two mahdvkyam or great say ings tat twam ast that thou art and aham brahmsmi i am brahman this oneness of soul and god lies at the very root of all vedic thought and it is this dominant ideal of the unity of all life and the oneness of truth which makes the study of the upanishads especially bene ficial at the present moment one of the most eminent of european orientalists writes if we fix our attention upon it this fundamental dogma of the introduction 17 vedanta system in its philosophical sim plicity as the identity of god and the soul the brahman and the aiman it will be found to possess a significance reaching far beyond the upanishads their time and country nay we claim for it an inestimable value for the whole race of mankind whatever new and unwonted paths the philosophy of the future may strike out this principle will remain permanently un shaken and from it no deviation can pos sibly take place if ever a general solution is reached of the great riddle the key can only be found where alone the secret of nature lies open to us from within that is to say in our innermost self it was here that for the first time the original thinkers of the upanishads to their im mortal honor found it the first introduction of the upanishads to the western world was through a trans lation into persian made in the seventeenth century more than a century later the dis tinguished french scholar anquetil du perron brought a copy of the manuscript from persia to france and translated it into french and latin publishing only the 18 introduction latin text despite the distortions which must have resulted from transmission through two alien languages the light of the thought still shone with such brightness that it drew from schopenhauer the fervent words how entirely does the oupnekhat upanishad breathe throughout the holy spirit of the vedas how is every one who by a diligent study of its persian latin has become familiar with that in comparable book stirred by that spirit to the very depth of his soul from every sentence deep original and sublime thoughts arise and the whole is pervaded by a high and holy and earnest spirit again he says the access to the vedas by means of the upanishads is in my eyes the greatest privilege which this still young century 1818 may claim before all previous cen turies this testimony is borne out by the thoughtful american scholar thoreau who writes what extracts from the vedas i have read fall on me like the light of a higher and purer luminary which describes a loftier course through a purer stratum free from particulars simple universal introduction 19 the first english translation was made by a learned hindu raj ram mohun roy 17751833 since that time there have been various european translations french german italian and english but a mere translation however accurate and sympathetic is not sufficient to make the upanishads accessible to the occidental mind professor max miiller after a life time of arduous labor in this field frankly confesses modern words are round an cient words are square and we may as well hope to solve the quadrature of the circle as to express adequately the ancient thought of the vedas in modern english without a commentary it is practically impossible to understand either the spirit or the meaning of the upanishads they were never designed as popular scriptures they grew up essentially as text books of godknowledge and selfknowledge and like all text books they need interpretation being transmitted orally from teacher to disciple the style was necessarily extremely condensed and in the form of aphorisms the language also was often metaphorical and obscure yet if one has the perse 20 introduction verance to penetrate beneath these mere surface difficulties one is repaid a hundred fold for these ancient sacred books contain the most precious gems of spiritual thought every upanishad begins with a peace chant shntipatha to create the proper atmosphere of purity and serenity to study about god the whole nature must be prepared so unitedly and with loving hearts teacher and disciples prayed to the supreme being for his grace and protec tion it is not possible to comprehend the subtle problems of life unless the thought is tranquil and the energy concentrated until our mind is withdrawn from the varied distractions and agitations of worldly affairs we cannot enter into the spirit of higher religious study no study is of avail so long as our inner being is not at tuned we must hold a peaceful attitude towards all living things and if it is lacking we must strive fervently to cultivate it through suggestion by chanting or repeating some holy text the same lesson is taught by jesus the christ when he says if thou bring thy gift to the altar and there rememberest that thy brother hath aught introduction 21 against thee leave there thy gift before the altar and go thy way first be recon ciled to thy brother and then come and offer thy gift bearing this lofty ideal of peace in our minds let us try to make our hearts free from prejudice doubt and intolerance so that from these sacred writings we may draw in abundance inspiration love and wisdom paramananda isaupanishad this upanishad derives tts title from the opening words isdvasya godcovered the use of isa lorda more personal name of the supreme being than brahman atman or self the names usually found in the upanishads constitues one of its peculiarities it forms the clos ing chapter of the yajurveda known as shukla white oneness of the soul and god and the value of both faith and works as means of ultimate attainment ore the leading themes of this upanishad the general teaching of the upanishads is that works alone even the highest can bring only iemporary happiness and must inevitably bind a man unless through them he gains knowledge of his real self to help him acquire this knowledge is the aim of this and oll upanishads isaupanishad peace chant m that the invisibleabsolute is whole whole is this the visible phenom enal from the invisible whole comes forth the visible whole though the visible whole has come out from that invisible whole yet the whole remains unaltered om peace peace peace he indefinite term that is used in the upanishads to designate the invisibleabsolute because no word or name can fully define it a finite object like a table or a tree can be defined but god who is infinite and un bounded cannot be expressed by finite language there fore the rishis or divine seers desirous not to limit the unlimited chose the indefinite term that to designate the absolute in the light of true wisdom the phenomenal and the absolute are inseparable all existence is in the absolute and whatever exists must exist in it hence all manifesta tion is merely a modification of the one supreme whole and neither increases nor diminishes it the whole there fore remains unaltered 26 the upanishads i ll this whatsoever exists in the uni verse should be covered by the lord having renounced the unreal enjoy the real do not covet the wealth of any man we cover all things with the lord by perceiving the divine presence everywhere when the conscious ness is firmly fixed in god the conception of diversity naturally drops away because the one cosmic existence shines through all things as we gain the light of wis dom we cease to cling to the unrealities of this world and we find all our joy in the realm of reality the word enjoy is also interpreted by the great commentator sankardcharya as protect because knowl edge of our true self is the greatest protector and sus tainer if we do not have this knowledge we cannot be happy because nothing on this external plane of phenom ena is permanent or dependable he who is rich in the knowledge of the self does not covet external power or possession i f one should desire to live in this world a hundred years oneshould live perform ing karma righteous deeds thus thou mayest live there is no other way by doing this karma the fruits of thy actions will not defile thee isau panishad 27 if a man still clings to long life and earthly possessions and is therefore unable to follow the path of self knowledge gndnanishi as prescribed in the first maniram text then he may follow the path of right action kormonisht karma here means actions per formed without selfish motive for the sake of the lord alone when a man performs actions clinging blindly to his lower desires then his actions bind him to the plane of ignorance or the plane of birth and death but when the same actions are performed with surrender to god they purify and liberate him i anz leaving their bodies they who have killed the self go to the worlds of the asuras covered with blinding ignorance the ides of rising to bright regions as a reward for welldoers and of falling into realms of darkness as a punishment for evildoers is common to all great religions but vedanta claims that this condition of heaven and hell is only temporary because our actions being finite can produce only a finite result what does it mean to kill the self how can the immortal soul ever be destroyed it cannot be destroyed it can only be obscured those who hold themselves under the sway of ignorance who serve the flesh and neglect the atman or the real self are not able to perceive the effulgent and indestructible nature of their soul hence they fall into the realm where the soul light does not shine here the upanishad shows that the only hell is absence of knowledge as long as man is overpowered 28 the upanishads by the darkness of ignorance he is the slave of nature and must accept whatever comes as the fruit of his thoughts and deeds when he strays into the path of unreality the sages declare that he destroys himself because he who clings to the perishable body and regards it as his true self must experience death many times iv hat one though motionless is swifter than the mind the senses can never overtake it for it ever goes before though immovable it travels faster than those who tun by it the allpervading air sustains all living beings his verse explains the character of the aiman or self a finite object can be taken from one place and put in another but it can only occupy one space at a time the atman however is present everywhere hence though one may run with the greatest swiftness to over take it already it is there before him even the allpervading air must be supported by this self since it is infinite and as nothing can live without breathing air all living things must draw their life from the cosmic self vv t moves and it moves not it is far and also it is near it is within and also it is without all this isau panishad 29 iz is near to those who have the power to understand it for it dwells in the heart of every one but it seems far to those whose mind is covered by the clouds of sensual ity and selfdelusion it is within because it is the inner most soul of all creatures and it is without as the essence of the whole external universe infilling it like the all pervading ether vi e who sees all beings in the self and the self in all beings he never turns away from it the self vil e who perceives all beings as the self for him how can there be delusion or grief when he sees this oneness every where he who perceives the self everywhere never shrinks from anything because through his higher conscious ness he feels united with ail life when a man sees god in all beings and all beings in god and also god dwelling in his own soul how can he hate any living thing grief and delusion rest upon a belief in diversity which leads to competition and all forms of selfishness with the realiza tion of oneness the sense of diversity vanishes and the cause of misery is removed 30 the upanishads viii e the self is allencircling resplendent bodiless spotless without sinews pure untouched by sin allseeing allknowing transcendent selfexistent he has disposed all things duly for eternal years ais text defines the real nature of the self when our mind is cleansed from the dross of matter then alone can we behold the vast radiant subtle everpure and spotless self the true basis of our existence ix hey enter into blind darkness who worship avidy ignorance and delu sion they fall as it were into greater dark ness who worship vidyd knowledge xx y vidy one end is attained by avidyd another thus we have heard from the wise men who taught this xi e who knows at the same time both vidyd and avidyd crosses over death by avidy and attains immortality through vidya isau panishad 31 ose who follow or worship the path of selfishness and pleasure avidy without knowing anything higher necessarily fall into darkness but those who worship or cherish vidy knowledge for mere intellectual pride and satisfaction fall into greater darkness because the opportunity which they misuse is greater in the subsequent verses vidy and avidy are used in something the same sense as faith and works in the christian bible neither alone can lead to the ultimate goal but when taken together they carry one to the highest work done with unselfish motive purifies the mind and enables man to perceive his undying nature from this he gains inevitably 2 knowledge of god because the soul and god are one and inseparable and when he knows himself to be one with the supreme and indestructible whole he realizes his immortality xii hey fall into blind darkness who wor ship the unmanifested and they fall into greater darkness who worship the manifested xti y the worship of the unmanifested one end is attained by the worship of the manifested another thus we have heard from the wise men who taught us this 32 the upanishads xiv e who knows at the same time both the unmanifested the cause of manifesta tion and the destructible or manifested he crosses over death through knowledge of the destructible and attains immortality through knowledge of the first cause unmani fested ts particular upanishad deals chiefly with the invisible cause and the visible manifestation and the whole trend of its teaching is to show that they are one and the same one being the outcome of the other hence no perfect knowledge is possible without simultane ous comprehension of both the wise men declare that he who worships in a onesided way whether the visible or the invisible does not reach the highest goal only he who has a coordinated understanding of both the visible and the invisible of matter and spirit of activity and that which is behind activity conquers nature and thus overcomes death by work by making the mind steady and by following the prescribed rules given in the scriptures a man gains wisdom by the light of that wisdom he is able to perceive the invisible cause in all visible forms therefore the wise man sees him in every manifested form they who have a true conception of god are never separated from him they exist in him and he in them isau panishad 33 xv he face of truth is hidden by a golden disk o pushan effulgent being uncover thy face that i the worshipper of truth may behold thee xvi pushan o sun sole traveller of the heavens controller of all son of prajapati withdraw thy rays and gather up thy burning effulgence now through thy grace i behold thy blessed and glorious form the purusha effulgent being who dwells within thee lam he heeze the sun who is the giver of all light is used as the symbol of the infinite giver of all wisdom the seeker after truth prays to the effulgent one to control his dazzling rays that his eyes no longer blinded by them may behold the truth having perceived it he proclaims now i see that that effulgent being and i are one and the same and my delusion is destroyed by the light of truth he is able to discriminate between the real and the unreal and the knowledge thus gained convinces him that he is one with the supreme that there is no difference between himself and the supreme truth or as christ said i and my father are one 34 the upanishads xvii ay my lifebreath go to the all pervading and immortal prna and let this body be burned to ashes om o mind remember thy deeds o mind re member remember thy deeds remember geek not fleeting results as the reward of thy actions o mind strive only for the imperishable this maniram or text is often chanted at the hour of death to remind one of the perishable nature of the body and the eternal nature of the soul when the clear vision of the distinction between the mortal body and the immortal soul dawns in the heart then all craving for physical pleasure or material possession drops away and one can say let the body be burned to ashes that the soul may attain its freedom for death is nothing more than the castingoff of a wornout garment xviii agni bright being lead us to blessedness by the good path o lord thou knowest all our deeds remove all evil and delusion from us to thee we offer our prostrations and supplications again and again here ends this upanishad isau panishad 35 his upanishad is called is4vasyaupanishad that which gives brahmavidy or knowledge of the all pervading deity the dominant thought running through it is that we cannot enjoy life or realize true happiness unless we consciously cover all with the omnipresent lord if we are not fully conscious of that which sustains our life how can we live wisely and perform our duties whatever we see movable or immovable good or bad it is all that we must not divide our conception of the universe for in dividing it we have only fragmentary knowledge and we thus limit ourselves he who sees all beings in his self and his self in all beings he never suffers because when he sees all creatures within his true self then jealousy grief and hatred van ish he alone can love that allpervading one is self effulgent birthless deathless pure untainted by sin and sorrow knowing this he becomes free from the bondage of matter and transcends death transcending death means realizing the difference between body and soul and identifying oneself with the soul when we actually behold the undecaying soul within us and realize our true nature we no longer identify ourself with the body which dies and we do not die with the body selfknowledge has always been the theme of the sages and the upanishads deal especially with the knowledge of the self and also with the knowledge of god because there is no difference between the self and god they are one andthe same that which comes out of the infinite whole must also be infinite hence the self is infinite that is 36 the upanishads the ocean we are the drops so long as the drop remains separate from the ocean it is small and weak but when it is one with the ocean then it has all the strength of the ocean similarly so long as man believes himself to be separate from the whole he is helpless but when he identifies himself with it then he transcends all weakness and partakes of its omnipotent qualities kathaupanishad the kathaupanishad is probably the most widely known of all the upanishads it was early translated into persian and through this rendering first made its way into europe later r0j rim mohkun roy brought out an english version it has since appeared in various lan guages ond english german and french writers are all agreed in pronouncing it one of the most perfect expressions of the religion and philosophy of the vedas sir edwin arnold popularized it by his metrical rendering under the name of the secret of death and ralph waldo emerson gives tts story in brief at the close of his essay on immor tality there is no consensus of opinion regarding the place of this upanishad in vedic literature some authorities declare it to belong to the yajurveda others to the sma veda while a large number put it down as a part of the athareaveda the story is first suggesied in the rig veda it is told more definitely in the vajurveda and in the kathaupanishad it appears fully elaboraied and inter woven with the loftiest vedic teaching there is nothing however to indicate the special place of this final version nor has any meaning been found for ike name katha the text presents a dialogue between an aspiring disciple nachiketas and the ruler of death regarding the great hereafter kathaupanishad peace chant ay he the supreme being protect us both teacher and taught may he be pleased with us may we acquire strength may our study bring us illumina tion may there be no enmity among us om peace peace peace part first i v aiasrava being desirous of heavenly rewards at the viswajit sacrifice made a gift of all that he possessed he had a son by the name of nachiketas it we the offerings were being dis tributed faith shraddh entered the heart ofnachiketas who though young yet reflected 40 the upanishads mm ihese cows have drunk water eaten grass and given milk for the last time and their senses have lost all vigor he who gives these undoubtedly goes to joyless realms jn inti the idea of sacrifice has always been to give freely for the joy of giving without asking anything in retum and the whole purpose and merit of the sacrifice is lost if the giver entertais the least thought of name fame or individual benefit the special viswajit sacrifice which vajasrava was making required of him to give away all that he possessed when however the gifts were brought forward to be offered his son nachiketas although probably a lad about twelve years of age observed how his heart at once became filled with shraddh there is no one english word which can convey the meaning of this sanskrit term it is more than mere faith it also implies selfreliance an independent sense of right and wrong and the courage of ones own conviction asa boy of tender age nachiketas had no right to question his fathers action yet impelled by the sudden awakening of his higher nature he could not but reflect by merely giving these useless cows my father cannot gain any merit if he has vowed to give all his possessions then he must also give me otherwise his sacrifice will not be complete and fruitful therefore anxious for his fathers welfare he approached him gently and reverently kathau panishad 41 iv e said to his father dear father to whom wilt thou give me he said it a second time then a third time the father replied i shall give thee unto death inachieketas being a dutiful son and eager to atone for his fathers inadequate sacrifice tried to remind him thus indirectly that he had not fulfilled his promise to give away all his possessions since he had not yet offered his own son who would be a worthier gift than useless cattle his father conscious that he was not making a true sacrifice tried to ignore the boys questions but irritated by his persistence he at last impatiently made answer ti give thee to yama the lord of death the fact that anger could so quickly rise in his heart proved that he had not the proper attitude of a sacrificer who must always be tranquil uplifted and free from egoism vv achiketas thought among many of my fathers pupils i stand first among many others i stand in the middle but never last what will be accomplished for my father by my going this day to yama t was not conceit which led nachiketas to consider his own standing and importance he was weighing his value as a son and pupil in order to be able to judge whether or not he had merit enough to prove a worthy gift al though he realized that his fathers harsh reply was only 42 the upanishads the expression of a momentary outburst of anger yet he believed that greater harm might befall his father if his word was not kept therefore he sought to strengthen his fathers resolution by reminding him of the transitory condition of life he said vi ook back to those who lived before and look to those who live now like grain the mortal decays and like grain again springs up is reborn at things perish truth alone remains why then fear to sacrifice me also thus nachiketas con vinced his father that he should remain true to his word and send him to yama the ruler of death then nachi ketas went to the abode of death but yama was absent and the boy waited without food or drink for three days on yamas return one of his household said to him vit l fire a brhmana guest enters into houses that fire is quenched by an offering therefore o vaivaswata bring water viii he foolish man in whose house a brhmana guest remains without food all his hopes and expectations all the merit kathau panishad 43 gained by his association with the holy by his good words and deeds all his sons and cattle are destroyed according to the ancient vedic ideal a guest is the representative of god and should be received with due reverence and honor especially is this the case with a brdkmane or a sannysin whose life is wholly consecrated to god any one who fails to give proper care to a holy guest brings misfortune on himself and his household when yama returned therefore one of the members of his household anxiously informed him of nachiketas presence and begged him to bring water to wash his feet this being always the first service to an arriving guest ix ama said o brhmana revered guest my salutations to thee as thou hast remained three nights in my house without food therefore choose three boons o brahmana x achiketas said may gautama my father be free from anxious thought about me may he lose all anger towards me and be pacified in heart may he know and welcome me when i am sent back by thee this o death is the first of the three boons i choose 44 the upanishads xi yam replied through my will aud dilaki aruni thy father will know thee and be again towards thee as before he will sleep in peace at night he will be free from wrath when he sees thee released from the mouth of death xii achiketas said in the realm of heaven there is no fear thou death art not there nor is there fear of old age having crossed beyond both hunger and thirst and being above grief they rejoice in heaven xiii hou knowest o death the fire sacrifice that leads to heaven tell this to me who am full of shraddh faith and yearning they who live in the realm of heaven enjoy freedom from death this i beg as my second boon kathau panishad 45 xiv ama replied i know well that fire which leads to the realm of heaven i shall tell it to thee listen to me know o nachiketas that this is the means of at taining endless worlds and their support it is hidden in the heart of all beings xv ama then told him that firesacrifice the beginning of all the worlds what bricks how many and how laid for the altar nachiketas repeated all as it was told to him then death being pleased with him again said xvi he greatsouled yama being well pleased said to him nachiketas i give thee now another boon this fire sacrifice shall be named after thee take also this garland of many colors xvii e who performs this nachiketa fire sacrifice three times being united with the three mother father and teacher 46 the upanishads and who fulfills the threefold duty study of the vedas sacrifice and almsgiving crosses over birth and death knowing this wor shipful shining fire born of brahman and realizing him he attains eternal peace xviii e who knows the threefold nachiketa fire and performs the nachiketa fire sacrifice with threefold knowledge having cast off the fetters of death and being beyond grief he rejoices in the realm of heaven xix nachiketas this is thy fire that leads to heaven which thou hast chosen as thy second boon people will call this fire after thy name ask the third boon nachiketas fire is regarded as the foundation of all the worlds because it is the revealer of creation if there were no fire or light no manifested form would be visible we read in the semitic scriptures in the beginning the lord said let there be light therefore that which stands in the external universe as one of the purest symbols of the divine also dwells in subtle form in the heart of every kathau panishad 47 living being as the vital energy the lifeforce or cause of existence yama now tells nachiketas how by performing sacri fice with the threefold knowledge he may transcend grief and death and reach heaven the threefold knowledge referred to is regarding the preparation of the altar and fire nachiketas being eager to learn listened with whole hearted attention and was able to repeat all that was told him this so pleased yama that he granted him the extra boon of naming the firesacrifice after him and gave him a garland set with precious stones verses xvixviii are regarded by many as an inter polation which would account for certain obscurities and repetitions in them xx achiketas said there is this doubt regarding what becomes of a man after death some say he exists others that he does not exist this knowledge i desire being instructed by thee of the boons this is the third boon xxi ama replied even the devas bright ones of old doubted regarding this it is not easy to know subtle indeed is this subject o nachiketas choose another boon do not press me ask not this boon of me 48 the upanishads xxii achiketas said o death thou sayest that even the devas had doubts about this and that it is not easy to know another teacher like unto thee is not to be found therefore no other boon can be equal to this one xxiii ama said ask for sons and grandsons who shall live a hundred years many cattle elephants gold and horses ask for lands of vast extent and live thyself as many autumns as thou desirest xxiv iw thou thinkest of any other boon equal to this ask for wealth and long life be ruler over the wide earth o nachiketas i shall make thee enjoyer of all desires xxv hatsoever objects of desire are difficult to obtain in the realm of mortals ask them all as thou desirest these lovely maidens with their chariots and kathaupanishad 49 musical instruments such as are not ob tainable by mortals be served by these whom i give to thee o nachiketas do not ask regarding death t third boon asked by nachiketas concerning the great hereafter was one which could be granted only to those who were freed from all mortal desires and limit ations therefore yama first tested nachiketas to see whether he was ready to receive such knowledge do not press me regarding this secret he said even wise men cannot understand it and thou art a mere lad take rather long life wealth whatever will give thee happiness on the mortal plane but the boy proved his strength and worthiness by remaining firm in his resolution to know the great secret of life and death xxvi achiketas said o death these are fleeting they weaken the vigor of all the senses in man even the longest life is short keep thou thy chariots dance and music xxvii an cannot be satisfied by wealth shall we possess wealth when we see thee death shall we continue to live as long as thou rulest therefore that boon alone is to be chosen by me 50 the upanishads xxviii ww man dwelling on the decaying mortal plane having approached the undecaying immortal one and having re flected upon the nature of enjoyment through beauty and sense pieasure would delight in long life xxix death that regarding which there is doubt of the great hereafter tell us nachiketas asks for no other boon than that which penetrates this hidden secret part second i ama said the good is one thing and the pleasant another these two having different ends bind a man it is well with him who chooses the good he who chooses the pleasant misses the true end ii he good and the pleasant approach man the wise examines both and dis criminates between them the wise prefers the good to the pleasant but the foolish man chooses the pleasant through love of bodily pleasure pan nachiketas after wise reflection thou hast renounced the pleasant and all pleasing forms thou hast not accepted this garland of great value for which many mortals perish 52 the upanishads iv ide apart are these two ignorance and what is known as wisdom leading in opposite directions i believe nachiketas to be one who longs for wisdom since many tempting objects have not turned thee aside this second part the ruler of death begins his instructions regarding the great hereafter there are two paths one leading godward the other leading to worldly pleasure he who follows one inevitably goes away from fhe other because like light and darkness they conflict one leads to the imperishable spiritual realm the other to the perishable physical realm both confront a man at every step of life the discerning man distinguishing between the two chooses the real and eternal and he alone attains the highest while the ignorant man preferring that which brings him immediate and tangible results misses the true purpose of his exist ence although yama put before nachiketas many temptations to test his sincerity and earnestness he judging them at their real value refused them all saying t have come from the mortal realm shall i ask for what is mortal i desire only that which is eternal then death said to him i now see that thou art a sincere desirer of truth i offered thee vast wealth long life and every form of pleasure which tempts and deludes men but thou hast proved thy worthiness by rejecting them all kathaupanishad 53 vv ools dwelling in ignorance yet imagin ing themselves wise and learned go round and round in crooked ways like the blind led by the blind vi he hereafter never rises before the thoughtless child the ignorant de luded by the glamour of wealth this worldalone is there is none other thinking thus he falls under my sway again and again there are many in the world who puffed up with intellectual conceit believe that they are capable of guiding others but although they may possess a certain amount of worldly wisdom they are devoid of deeper understanding therefore all that they say merely increases doubt and confusion in the minds of those who hear them hence they are likened to blind men leading the blind the hereafter does not shine before those who are lacking in the power of discrimination and are easily carried away therefore by the charm of fleeting objects as children are tempted by toys so they are tempted by pleasure power name and fame to them these seem the only realities being thus attached to perishable things they come many times under the dominion of death there is one part of us which must die there is 54 the upanishads another part which never dies when a man can identify himself with his undying nature which is one with god then he overcomes death vii e about whom many are not even able to hear whom many cannot compre hend even after hearing wonderful is the teacher wonderful is he who can receive when taught by an able teacher hhroughout the vedic scriptures it is declared that no one can impart spiritual knowledge unless he has realization what is meant by realization it means knowledge based on direct perception in india often the best teachers have no learning but their character is so shining that every one learns merely by coming in contact with them in one of the scriptures we read under a banyan tree sat a youthful teacher and beside him an aged disciple the mind of the disciple was full of doubts and questions but although the teacher continued silent gradually every doubt vanished from the disciples mind this signifies that the conveying of spiritual teach ing does not depend upon words only it is the life the illumination which counts such godenlightened men however cannot easily be found but even with such a teacher the knowledge of the self cannot be gained unless the heart of the disciple is open and ready for the truth hence yama says both teacher and taught must be wonderful kathau panishad 55 vil wen taught by a man of inferior understanding this atman cannot be truly known even though frequently thought upon there is no way to know it unless it is taught by another an il lumined teacher for it is subtler than the subtle and beyond argument ix dearest this atman cannot be attained by argument it is truly known only when taught by another a wise teacher o nachiketas thou hast attained it thou art fixedin truth may we ever find a questioner like thee knowledge of the atman or self cannot be attained when it is taught by those who themselves lack in real understanding of it and who therefore having no definite conviction of their own differ among themselves as to its nature and existence only he who has been able to perceive the self directly through the unfoldment of his higher nature can proclaim what it actually is and his words alone carry weight and bring illumination it is too subtle to be reached by argument this secret regarding the hereafter cannot be known through reason ing or mere intellectual gymnastics it is to be attained only in a state of consciousness which transcends the boundary line of reason 56 the upanishads x know that earthly treasure is transi tory for the eternal can never be attained by things which are noneternal hence the nachiketa fire sacrifice has been performed by me with perishable things and yet i have attained the eternal xi nachiketas thou hast seen the ful filment of all desires the basis of the universe the endless fruit of sacrificial rites the other shore where there is no fear that which is praiseworthy the great and wide support yet being wise thou hast rejected all with firm resolve he teacher saying that the imperishable cannot be attained by the perishable shows that no amount of observance of rituals and ceremonies can earn the im perishable and eternal although the nachiketa fire sacrifice may bring results which seem eternal to mortals because of their long duration yet they too must come to an end therefore this sacrifice cannot lead to the final goal yama praises nachiketas because when all heavenly and earthly pleasures 2s well as knowledge of all realms and their enjoyments were offered him yet he cast them aside and remained firm in his desire for truth alone kathau panishad 57 xii he wise who by means of the highest meditation on the self knows the ancient one difficult to perceive seated in the innermost recess hidden in the cave of the heart dwelling in the depth of inner being he who knows that one as god is liberated from the fetters of joy and sorrow xi mortal having heard and fully grasped this and having realized through discrimination the subtle self re joices because he has obtained that which is the source of all joy i think the abode of truth is open to nachiketas t scriptures give three stages in all spiritual attain ment the aspirant must first hear about the truth from an enlightened teacher next he must reflect upon what he has heard then by constant practice of discrimination and meditation he realizes it and with realization comes the fulfilment of every desire because it unites him with the source of all having beheld this a man learns that all sense pleasures are but fragmentary reflections of that one supreme joy which can be found in the true self alone yama assures nachiketas that there is no doubt of his realizing the truth because he has shown the highest discrimination as well as fixity of purpose 58 the upanishads xiv achiketas said that which thou seest which is neither virtue nor vice neither cause nor effect neither past nor future but beyond these tell me that xv ama replied that goal which all the vedas glorify which all austerities pro claim desiring which people practise brah macharya a life of continence and service that goal i tell thee briefly it is aum wer name can man give to god how can the infinite be bound by any finite word all that language can express must be finite since it is itself finite yet it is very difficult for mortals to think or speak of any thing without calling it by a definite name knowing this the sages gave to the supreme the name aum which stands as the root of all language the first letter ais the mothersound being the natural sound uttered by every creature when the throat is opened and no sound can be made without opening the throat the last letter m spoken by closing the lips terminates all articulation as one carries the sound from the throat to the lips it passes through the sound u these three sounds therefore cover the whole field of possible articulate sound their combination is called the akshera or the imperishable word the soundbrahman or the word kathaupanishad 59 god because it is the most universal name which can be given to the supreme hence it must be the word which was in the beginning and corresponds to the logos of christian theology it is because of the allembracing significance of this name that it is used so universally in the vedic scriptures to designate the absolute xvi his word is indeed brahman this word is indeed the supreme he who knows this word obtains whatever he desires xvii his is the best support this is the highest support he who knows this support is glorified in the world of brahman ts sacred word is the highest symbol of the abso lute he who through meditating on it grasps its full significance realizes the glory of god and at once has all his desires satisfied because god is the fulfilment of all desires xvhi his self is never born nor does it die it did not spring from anything nor did anything spring from it this ancient one is unborn eternal everlasting it is not slain even though the body is slain 60 the upanishads xix f the slayer thinks that he slays or if the slain thinks that he is slain both of these know not for it neither slays nor is it slain xx he self is subtler than the subtle greater than the great it dwells in the heart of each living being he who is free from desire and free from grief with mind and senses tranquil beholds the glory of the atman altoucs this aiman dwells in the heart of every living being yet it is not perceived by ordinary mortals because of its subtlety it cannot be perceived by the senses a finer spiritual sight is required the heart must be pure and freed from every unworthy selfish desire the thought must be indrawn from all external objects mind and body must be under control when the whole being thus becomes calm and serene then it is possible to perceive that effulgent atnan it is subtler than the subtle because it is the invisible essence of every thing and it is greater than the great because it is the boundless sustaining power of the whole universe that upon which all existence rests kathau panishad 61 xxt hough sitting it travels far though lying it goes everywhere who else save me is fit to know that god who is both joyful and joyless he self is allpervading hence it is that which sits still and that which travels that which is active and that which is inactive it is both stationary and moving and it is the basis of all forms of existence therefore whatever exists in the universe whether joy or joylessness pleasure or pain must spring from it who is better able to know god than i myself since he resides in my heart and is the very essence of my being such should be the attitude of one who is seeking xxii he wise who know the self bodiless seated within perishable bodies great and allpervading grieve not ween wise man through the practice of discrimi nation has seen clearly the distinction between body and soul he knows that his true self is not the body though it dwells in the body thus realizing the inde structible allpervading nature of his real self he sur mounts all fear of death or loss and is not moved even by the greatest sorrow 62 the upanishads xxii his self cannot be attained by study of the scriptures nor by intellectual perception nor by frequent hearing of it he whom the self chooses by him alone is it attained to him the self reveals its true nature we may imagine that by much study we can find out god but merely hearing about a thing and gaining an intellectual comprehension of it does not mean attain ing true knowledge of it knowledge only comes through direct perception and direct perception of god is possible for those alone who are pure in heart and spiritually awakened although he is alike to all beings and his mercy is on all yet the impure and worldyminded do not get the blessing because they do not know how to open their hearts to it he who longs for god him the lord chooses because to him alone can he reveal his true nature xxiv e who has not turned away from evil conduct whose senses are uncontrolled who is not tranquil whose mind is not at rest he can never attain this atman even by knowledge kathau panishad 63 yoma having first described what the atman is now tells us how to attain it a man must try to subdue his lower nature and gain control over the body and senses he must conquer the impure selfish desires which now disturb the serenity of his mind that it may grow calm and peaceful in other words he must live the life and develop all spiritual qualities in order to perceive the atman xxv ho then can know where is this mighty self he that self to whom the brhmanas and kshairiyas are but food and death itself a condiment t text proclaims the glory and majesty of the supreme the brhmonas stand for spiritual strength the ksheiriyas for physical strength yet both are overpowered by his mightiness life and death alike are food for him as the light of the great sun swallows up all the lesser lights of the universe similarly all worlds are lost in the effulgence of the eternal omnipresent being patt cpird i here are two who enjoy the fruits of their good deeds in the world having entered into the cave of the heart seated there on the highest summit the knowers of brahman call them shadow and light so also they are called by householders who perform five firesacrifices or three nachi keta firesacrifices hee the two signify the higher self and the lower self dwelling in the innermost cave of the heart the seers of truth as well as householders who follow the path of rituals and outer forms with the hope of enjoy ing the fruits of their good deeds both proclaim that the higher self is like a light and the lower self like a shadow when the truth shines clearly in the heart of the knower then he surmounts the apparent duality of his nature and becomes convinced that there is but one and that all outer manifestations are nothing but reflections or pro jections of that one it ay we be able to learn that nachi keta firesacrifice which is a bridge for those who perform sacrifice may we also know the one who is the highest im kathau panishad 65 perishable brahman for those who desire to cross over to the other shore which is beyond fear significance of this text is may we acquire the knowledge of brahman the supreme in both mani fested and unmanifested form he is manifested as the lord of sacrifice for those who follow the path of ritual he is the unmanifested eternal universal supreme being for those who follow the path of wisdom the other shore being the realm of immortality is said to be beyond fear because disease death and all that which mortals fear cease to exist there it is believed by many that these two opening verses were a later interpolation iii now the aiman self as the lord of the chariot and the body as the chariot know also the intellect to be the driver and mind the reins iv he senses are called the horses the sense objects are the roads when the atman is united with body senses and mind then the wise call him the enjoyer ix the third chapter yama defines what part of our being dies and what part is deathless what is mortal and what is immortal but the afman the higher self is so entirely beyond human conception that it is impossible to give a 66 the upanishads direct definition of it only through similies can some idea of it be conveyed that is the reason why all the great teachers of the world have so often taught in the form of parables so here the ruler of death represents the self as the lord of this chariot of the body the intellect or discriminative faculty is the driver who controls these wild horses of the senses by holding firmly the reins of the mind the roads over which these horses travel are made up of all the external objects which attract or repel the senses the sense of smelling follows the path of sweet odors the sense of seeing the way of beautiful sights thus each sense unless restrained by the discriminative faculty seeks to go out towards its special objects when the self is joined with body mind and senses it is called the intelligent enjoyer because it is the one who wills feels perceives and does everything vv e who is without discrimination and whose mind is always uncontrolled his senses are unmanageable like the vicious horses of a driver vi ut he who is full of discrimination and whose mind is always controlled his senses are manageable like the good horses of a driver 68 the upanishads a driver must possess first a thorough knowledge of the road next he must understand how to handle the reins and control his horses then will he drive safely to his destination similarly in this journey of life our mind and senses must be wholly under the control of our higher discriminative faculty for only when all our forces work in unison can we hope to reach the goal the abode of absolute truth x eyond the senses are the objects beyond the objects is the mind beyond the mind is the intellect beyond the intellect is the great atman xi eyond the great aiman is the un manifested beyond the unmanifested is the purusha the cosmic soul beyond the purusha there is nothing that is the end that is the final goal these two verses the teacher shows the process of discrimination by which one attains knowledge of the subtle self beginning with the senseorgans he leads up to the less and less gross until he reaches that which is subtiest of all the true self of man the senses are dependent on senseobjects because without these the senses would have no utility superior to senseobjects is the mind because unless these objects affect the mind they kathau panishad 69 cannot influence the senses over the mind the deter minative faculty exercises power this determinative faculty is governed by the individual self beyond this self is the undifferentiated creative energy kmown as avyakiam and above this is the puruska or supreme self than this there is nothing higher that is the goal the highest abode of peace and bliss xii ts atman self hidden in all beings does not shine forth but it is seen by subtle seers through keen and subtle under standing ef it dwells in ali living beings why do we not see it because the ordinary mans vision is too dull and dis tracted it is visible to those alone whose intellect has been purified by constant thought on the supreme and whose sight therefore has become refined and sharpened this keenness of vision comes only when all our forces have been made onepointed through steadfast practice of concentration and meditation xiii wise man should control speech by mind mind by intellect intellect by the great atman and that by the peaceful one the paramiman or supreme self 70 the upanishads h yama gives the practical method to be followed if one wishes to realize the supreme the word speech stands for all the senses first therefore a man must control his outgoing senses by the mind then the mind must be brought under the control of the dis criminative faculty that is it must be withdrawn from all senseobjects and cease to waste its energies on non essential things the discriminative faculty in turn must be controlled by the higher individual intelligence and this must be governed wholly by the supreme intelligence xiv rise awake having reached the great ones illumined teachers gain understanding the path is as sharp as a razor impassable and difficult to travel so the wise declare his is the eternal call of the wise awake from the slumber of ignorance arise and seek out those who know the truth because only those who have direct vision of truth are capable of teaching it invoke their blessing with a humble spirit and seek to be instructed by them the path is very difficult to tread no thoughtless or lethargic person can safely travel on it one must be strong wakeful and persevering xv nowing that which is soundless touchless formless undecaying also tasteless odorless and eternal beginningless kathau panishad au endless and immutable beyond the un manifested knowing that man escapes from the mouth of death he ruler of death defines here the innermost essence of our being because of its extreme subtlety it cannot be heard or felt or smelled or tasted like any ordi nary object it never dies it has no beginning or end it is unchangeable realizing this supreme reality man escapes from death and attains everlasting life thus the teacher has gradually led nachiketas to a point where he can reveal to him the secret of death the boy had thought that there was a place where he could stay and become immortal but yama shows him that immor tality is a state of consciousness and is not gained so long as man clings to name and form or to perishable objects what dies form therefore the formful man dies but not that which dwells within although inconceivably subtle the sages have always made an effort through similies and analogies to give some idea of this inner self or the god within they have described it as beyond mind and speech too subtle for ordinary perception but not beyond the range of purified vision xvi he intelligent man who has heard and repeated the ancient story of nachi ketas told by the ruler of death is glorified in the world of brahman 72 the upanishads xvit e who with devotion recites this highest secret of immortality before an as sembly of brkmanas pious men or at the time of shrddha funeral ceremonies gains everlasting reward he gains everlasting reward patt fourth i he selfexistent created the senses outgoing for this reason man sees the external but not the inner aiman self some wise man however desiring immor tality with eyes turned away from the external sees the atman within the last chapter the ruler of death instructed nachi ketas regarding the nature and glory of the self now he shows the reason why the self is not seen by the majority it is because mans mind is constantly drawn outward through the channels of his senses and this prevents his seeing the inner self pratyagimen but now and then a seeker wiser than others goes within and attains the vision of the undying self ii hildren the ignorant pursue ex ternal pleasures thus they fall into the widespread snare of death but the wise knowing the nature of immortality do not seek the permanent among fleeting things 74 the upanishads hose who are devoid of discrimination and fail to distinguish between real and unreal the fleeting and the permanent set their hearts on the changeable things of this world hence they entangle themselves in the net of insatiable desire which leads inevitably to disappoint ment and suffering to such death must seem a reality because they identify themselves with that which is born and which dies but the wise who see deeper into the nature of things are no longer deluded by the charm of the phenomenal world and do not seek for permanent happi ness among its passing enjoyments til hat by which one knows form taste smell sound touch and sense enjoy ments by that also one knows whatever remains to be known this verily is that which thou hast asked to know iv hat by which a mortal perceives both in dream and in waking by knowing that great allpervading atman the wise man grieves no more n these verses the teacher tries to make plain that all knowledge as well as all sense perception in every state of consciousness sleeping dreaming or waking is possible only because the self exists there can be no kathau panishad 75 knowledge or perception independent of the self wise men aware of this identify themselves with their higher self and thus transcend the realm of grief vv h who knows this atman the honey eater perceiver and enjoyer of ob jects ever near as the lord of the past and future fears no more this verily is that vi e who sees him seated in the five elements born of tapas fire of brahman born before water who having entered the cave of the heart abides therein this verily is that s verse indicates that he the great self is the cause of all created objects according to the vedas his first manifestation was erahm4 the personal god or creator born of the fire of wisdom he existed before the evolution of the five elements earth water fire air and ether hence he was born before water he is the self dwelling in the hearts of all creatures vii e who knows aditi who rises with prana the life principle existent in all the devas who having entered into the 96 the upanishads heart abides there and who was born from the elements this verily is that s verse is somewhat obscure and seems like an interpolated amplification of the preceding verse viii he allseeing fire which exists hidden in the two sticks as the foetus is well guarded in the womb by the mother that fire is to be worshipped day after day by wakeful seekers after wisdom as well as by sacrificers this verily is that tre is called allseeing because its light makes every thing visible in vedic sacrifices the altar fire was always kindled by rubbing together two sticks of a special kind of wood called arani because fire was regarded as one of the most perfect symbols of divine wisdom it was to be worshipped by all seekers after truth whether they followed the path of meditation or the path of rituals ix rom whence the sun rises and whither it goes at setting upon that all the devas depend no one goes beyond that this verily is that kathau panishad 77 x hat is here in the visible world that is there in the invisible he who sees difference between visible and invisible goes from death to death xi yy mind alone this is to be realized there is no difference whatever be tween visible and invisible he who sees difference here between these goes from death to death is the sight of true wisdom there is no difference between the creator and the created even physical science has come to recognize that cause and effect are but two aspects of one manifestation of energy he who fails to see this being engrossed in the visible only goes from death to death because he clings to external forms which are per ishable only the essence which dwells within is unchange able and imperishable this knowledge of the oneness of visible and invisible however cannot be acquired through senseperception it can only be attained by the purified mind xii he purusha self of the size of a thumb resides in the middle of the body as the lord of the past and the future 78 the upanishads he who knows him fears no more this verily is that th seat of the purusha is said to be the heart hence it resides in the middle of the body although it is limitless and allpervading yet in relation to its abiding place it is represented as limited in extension the size of athumb this refers really to the heart which in shape may be likened to a thumb as light is everywhere yet we see it focused in a lamp and believe it to be there only similarly although the lifecurrent flows everywhere in the body the heart is regarded as peculiarly its seat xt hat purusha of the size of a thumb is like a light without smoke lord of the past and the future he is the same today and tomorrow this verily is that ix this verse the teacher defines the effulgent nature of the soul whose light is pure like a flame without smoke he also answers the question put by nachiketas as to what happens after death by declaring that no real change takes place because the soul is ever the same xiv s rain water falling on the mountain top runs down over the rocks on all sides similarly he who sees difference kathau panishad 79 between visible forms runs after them in various directions xv gautama nachiketas as pure water poured into pure water becomes one so also is it with the self of an illumined knower he becomes one with the supreme part sittd i he city of the unborn whose knowl edge is unchanging has eleven gates thinking on him man grieves no more and being freed from ignorance he attains liberation this verily is that ts human body is called a city with eleven gates where the eternal unborn spirit dwells these gates are the two eyes two ears two nostrils the mouth the navel the two lower apertures and the imperceptible opening at the top of the head the self or atman holds the position of ruler in this city and being above the modifications of birth death and ail human imperfections it is not affected by the changes of the physical organism as the intelligent man through constant thought and meditation realizes the splendor of this supreme spirit he becomes free from that part of his nature which grieves and suffers and thus he attains liberation i e is the sun dwelling in the bright heaven he is the air dwelling in space he is the fire burning on the altar he is the guest dwelling in the house he dwells in man he dwells in those

what it enters so does the atman within all living beings though one become various according to what it enters it also exists outside by sing these similies of fre and air the teacher tries to show nachiketas the subtle quality of the great self who although one and formless like air and fire yet assumes different shapes according to the form in which it dwells but being allpervading and unlimited it cannot be confined to these forms therefore it is said that it also exists outside all forms xi s the sun the eye of the whole world is not defiled by external impurities seen by the eyes thus the one inner self of all living beings is not defiled by the misery of the world being outside it te sun is called the eye of the world because it reveals objects as the sun may shine on the most jmpure object yet remain uncontaminated by it so the 84 the upanishads divine self within is not touched by the impurity or suffering of the physical form in which it dwells the self being beyond all bodily limitations xii here is one ruler the self of all living beings who makes the one form mani fold the wise who perceive him seated within their self to them belongs eternal bliss not to others xiii ternal among the changing con sciousness of the conscious who though one fulfils the desires of many the wise who perceive him seated within their self to them belongs eternal peace not to

ancient aswattha tree has its root above and branches below that is pure that is brahman that alone is called the immortal all the worlds rest in that none goes beyond that this verily is that s verse indicates the origin of the tree of creation the samsravriksha which is rooted above in brahman the supreme and sends its branches downward into the phenomenal world heat and cold pleasure and pain birth and death and alt the shifting conditions of the mortal realm these are the branches but the origin of the tree the brahman is eternally pure unchanging free and deathless from the highest angelic form to the minutest atom all created things have their origin in him he is the foundation of the universe there is nothing beyond him ii hatever there is in the universe is evolved from prne

of all existence his position is like that of a king whom all must obey hence it is said that the gods of sun moon wind rain do his bidding he is likened to an upraised thunderbolt because of the impartial and inevitable nature of his law which all powers great or small must obey absolutely iv f a man is not able to know him before the dissolution of the body then he be comes embodied again in the created worlds as soon as a2 man acquires knowledge of the supreme he is liberated but if he fails to attain such knowledge before his soul is separated from the body then he must take other bodies and return again and again to this realm of birth and death until through varied experience he realizes the nature of the supreme and his relation to him 88 the upanishads vv s in a mirror so is he seen within oneself as in a dream so is he seen in the world of the fathers departed spirits as in water so is he seen in the world of gandharoas the angelic realm as light and shadow so is he seen in the world of brahma the creator ween by means of a purified understanding one beholds god within the image is distinct as in a polished mirror but one cannot have clear vision of the supreme by attaining to the various realms known as heavens where one reaps the fruit of his good deeds it is only by developing ones highest consciousness here in this life that perfect godvision can be attained vi nowing that the senses are distinct from the atman and their rising and setting separate from the atman a wise man grieves no more a wise man never confounds the aiman which is birthless and deathless with that which has beginning and end therefore when he sees his senses and his physical organism waxing and waning he knows that his real self within can never be affected by these outer changes so he remains unmoved kathau panishad 89 vii igher than the senses is the mind higher than the mind is the intellect higher than the intellect is the great atman higher than the aman is

with the eye he is per ceived by the heart by the intellect and by the mind they who know this become immortal th supreme being formless cannot be discerned by the senses hence all knowledge of him must be acquired by the subtler faculties of heart intellect and mind which are developed only through the purifying practice of meditation go the upanishads x wwe the five organs of perception become still together with the mind and the intellect ceases to be active that is called the highest state he teacher now shows nachiketas the process by which the transcendental vision can be attained the outgoing senses seeing hearing smelling touch ing tasting the restless mind and the intellect all must be indrawn and quieted the state of equilibrium thus attained is called the highest state because all the forces of ones being become united and focused and this in evitably leads to supersensuous vision xi his firm holding back of the senses is what is known as yoga then one should become watchful for yoga comes and goes yoca literally means to join or to unite the lower self with the higher self the object with the subject the worshipper with god in order to gain this union however one must first disunite oneself from all that scatters the physical mental and intellectual forces so the outgoing perceptions must be detached from the external world and indrawn when this is accomplished through constant practice of concentration and meditation the union takes place of its own accord but it may be lost again unless one is watchful kathau panishad 91 xii e cannot be attained by speech by mind or by the eye how can that be realized except by him who says he is xiii e should be realized as he is and also as the reality of both visible and invisible he who knows him as he is to him alone his real nature is revealed his supersensuous vision cannot be gained through mans ordinary faculties by mind eye or speech the manifested attributes of the divine can be apprehended but only one who has acquired the supersensuous sight can directly perceive gods existence and declare definitely that he is that he alone exists in both the visible and the invisible world xiv hen all desires dwelling in the heart cease then the mortal becomes immortal and attains brahman here xv when all the ties of the heart are cut asunder here then the mortal be comes immortal such is the teaching 92 the upanishads xvi here are a hundred and one nerves of the heart one of them penetrates the centre of the head going upward through it one attains immortality the other hundred nervecourses lead in departing to different worlds t nervous system of the body provides the channels through which the mind travels the direction in which it moves is determined by its desires and tendencies when the mind becomes pure and desireless it takes the upward course and at the time of departing passes out through the imperceptible opening at the crown of the head but as long as it remains full of desires its courseis downward towards the realms where those desires can be satisfied xvit he purusha the inner self of the size of a thumb is ever seated in the heart of all living beings with perseverance man should draw him out from his body as one draws the inner stalk from a blade of grass one should know him as pure and deathless as pure and deathless s has been explained in part fourth verse xii the inner self although unlimited is described as the size of a thumb because of its abidingplace in the heart kathau panishad 93 often likened to a lotusbud which is similar to a thumb in size and shape through the process of steadfast dis crimination one should learn to differentiate the soul from the body just as one separates the pith from a reed xviii hus nachiketas having acquired this wisdom taught by the ruler of death together with all the rules of yoga became free from impurity and death and attained brahman the supreme so also will it be with

no enmity among us omi peace peace peace here ends this upanishad kenaupanishad like the isdvdsya this upanishad derives its name from the opening word of the text kenaishitam by whom directed it is also known as the talavakrau pantshad because of its place as a chapter in the talavakdrabrlmana of the samaveda among the upanishads i is one of the most analytical and metaphysical its purpose being to lead the mind from the gross to the subtle from effect to cause by a series of profound questions and answers it seeks to locate the source of mans being and to expand his selfconsciousness until has become identical with godconsciousness kenaupanishad peace chant ay my limbs speech prna life force sight hearing strength and all my senses gain in vigor allis the brah man supreme lord of the upanishads may i never deny the brahman may the brahman never deny me may there be no denial of the brahman may there be no separation from the brahman may all the virtues declared in the sacred upanishads be manifest in me who am devoted to the atman higher self may they be manifest in me om peace peace peace part first i y whom commanded and directed does the mind go towards its objects com manded by whom does the lifeforce the first cause move at whose will do men utter speech what power directs the eye and the ear hus the disciple approached the master and inquired concerning the cause of life and human activity hav ing a sincere longing for truth he desired to know who really sees and hears who actuates the apparent physical man he perceived all about him the phenomenal world the existence of which he could prove by his senses but he sought to know the invisible causal world of which he was now only vaguely conscious is mind allpervading and allpowerful or is it impelled by some other force he asked who sends forth the vital energy without which nothing can exist the teacher replies ii t is the ear of the ear the mind of the mind the speech of the speech the life of the life the eye of the eye the wise freed from the senses and from mortal desires after leaving this world become immortal kenaupanishad 99 an ordinary man hears sees thinks but he is satisfied to know only as much as can be known through the senses he does not analyze and try to find that which stands behind the ear or eye or mind he is completely identified with his external nature his conception does not go beyond the little circle of his bodily life which con cerns the outer man only he has no consciousness of that which enables his senses and organs to perform their tasks there is a vast difference between the manifested form and that which is manifested through the form when we know that we shall not die with the body one who clings to the senses and to things that are ephemeral must die many deaths but that man who knows the eye of the eye the ear of the ear having severed himself from his physical nature becomes immortal immortality is attained when man transcends his apparent nature and finds that subtle eternal and inexhaustible essence which is within him tit here the eye does not go nor speech nor mind we do not know that we do not understand how it can be taught it is distinct from the known and also it is beyond the unknown thus we have heard from the ancient teachers who told us about it hese physical eyes are unable to perceive that subtle essence nor can it be expressed by finite language or known by finite intelligence because it is 100 the upanishads infinite our conception of knowing finite things is to know their name and form but knowledge of god must be distinct from such knowledge this is why some declare god to be unknown and unknowable because he is far more than eye or mind or speech can perceive com prehend or express the upanishad does not say that he cannot be known he is unknowable to mans finite nature how can a finite mortal apprehend the infinite whole but he can be known by mans godlike nature iv hat which speech does not illumine but which illumines speech know that alone to be the brahman the supreme being not this which people worship here vv hat which cannot be thought by mind but by which they say mind is able to think know that alone to be the brah man not this which people worship here vi hat which is not seen by the eye but by which the eye is able to see know that alone to be the brahman not this which people worship here kenau panishad 10l val hat which cannot be heard by the ear but by which the ear is able to hear know that alone to be brahman not this which people worship here vii hat which none breathes with the breath but by which breath is in breathed know that alone to be the brah man not this which people worship here odinarily we know three states of consciousness only waking dreaming and sleeping there is however a fourth state the superconscious which tran ascends these in the first three states the mind is not clear enough to save us from error but in the fourth state it gains such purity of vision that it can perceive the divine if god could be known by the limited mind and senses then godknowledge would be like any other knowledge and spiritual science like any physical science he can be known however by the purified mind only therefore to know god man must purify himself the mind described in the upanishads is the superconscious mind according to the vedic sages the mind in its ordinary state is only another sense organ this mind is limited but when it becomes illumined by the light of the coamic intelligence or the mind of the mind then it is able to apprehend the first cause or that which stands behind all external activities part second i f thou thinkest i know it well then it is certain that thou knowest but little of the brahman absolute truth or in what form he resideth in the devas minor aspects of deity therefore i think that what thou thinkest to be known is still to be sought after aving given the definition of the real self or brah man by which mortals are able to see hear feel and think the teacher was afraid that the disciple after merely hearing about it might conclude that he knew it so he said to him you have heard about it but that is not enough you must experience it mere intellectual recognition will not give you true knowledge of it neither can it be taught to you the teacher can only show the way you must find it for yourself knowledge means union between subject and object to gain this union one must practise theory cannot help us the previous chapter has shown that the knowledge of brahman is beyond senseperception there the eye does not go nor speech nor mind that is distinct from known and also it is beyond the unknown there fore it was necessary for the teacher to remind the disciple that knowledge based on senseperception or intellectual kenau panishad 103 apprehension should not be confounded with supersensuous knowledge although the disciple had listened to the teacher with unquestioning mind and was intellectually convinced of the truth of his words it was now necessary for him to prove by his own experience what he had heard guided by the teacher he sought within himself through meditation the meaning of brahman and having gained a new vision he approached the teacher once more i he disciple said i do not think i know tt well nor do i think that i do not know it he among us who knows it truly knows what is meant by i know and also what is meant by i know it not tas appears to be contradictory but it is not in the previous chapter we learned that brahman is dis tinct from the known and beyond the unknown the disciple realizing this says so far as mortal conception is concerned i do not think i know because i understand that it is beyond mind and speech yet from the higher point of view i cannot say that i do not know for the very fact that i exist that i can seek it shows that i know for it is the source of my being i do not know however in the sense of knowing the whole infinite ocean of exist ence the word knowledge is used ordinarily to signify acquaintance with phenomenz only but man must transcend this relative knowledge before he can have a clear con ception of god one who wishes to attain soulconscious ness must rise above matter 104 the upanishads the observation of material science being confined to the sense plane it ignores what is beyond therefore it must always be limited and subject to change it dis covered atoms then it went further and discovered elec trons and when it had found the one it had to drop the other so this kind of knowledge can never lead to the ultimate knowledge of the infinite because it is exclusive and not inclusive spiritual science is not merely a question of mind and brain it depends on the awakening of our latent higher consciousness tit e who thinks he knows it not knows it he who thinks he knows it knows it not the true knowers think they can never know it because of its infinitude while the ignorant think they know it y this text the teacher confirms the idea that brahman is unthinkable because unconditioned therefore he says he who considers it beyond thought beyond senseperception beyond mind and speech he alone has a true understanding of brahman they who judge a living being from his external form and sense faculties know him not because the real self of man is not manifested in his seeing hearing speaking his real self is that within by which he hears and speaks and sees in the same way he knows not brahman who thinks he knows it by name and form the arrogant and foolish man thinks he knows everything but the true knower is humble he says how can i know thee who art infinite and beyond mind kenaupanishad 105 and speech in the last portion of the text the teacher draws an impressive contrast between the attitude of the wise man who knows but thinks he does not know and that of the ignorant who does not know but thinks he knows iv t brahman is known when it is known in every state of consciousness through such knowledge one attains immortality by attaining this self man gains strength and by selfknowledge immortality is at tained e have learned from the previous text that the brahman is unknown to those whose knowledge is limited to sense experience but he is not unknown to those whose purified intelligence perceives him as the basis of all states of consciousness and the essence of all things by this higher knowledge a man attains im mortality because he knows that although his body may decay and die the subtle essence of his being remains untouched such an one also acquires unlimited strength because he identifies himself with the ultimate source the strength which comes from ones own muscle and brain or from ones individual power must be limited and mortal and therefore cannot lift one beyond death but through the strength which atmagndne or selfknowledge gives immortality is reached whenever knowledge is based on direct perception of this undying essence one transcends all fear of death and becomes immortal 106 the upanishads vv f one knows it here that is truth if one knows it not here then great is his loss the wise seeing the same self in all beings being liberated from this world become immortal part chird i he brahman once won a victory for the devas through that victory of the brahman the devas became elated they thought this victory is ours this glory is ours rahman here does not mean a personal deity there is a brahma the first person of the hindu trinity but brahman is the absolute the one without a second the essence of all there are different names and forms which represent certain personal aspects of divinity such as brahma the creator vishnu the preserver and siva the transformer but no one of these can fully represent the whole brahman is the vast ocean of being on which rise numberless ripples and waves of manifestation from the smallest atomic form to a deva or an angel all spring from that limitless ocean of brahman the inexhaustible source of life no manifested form of life can be inde pendent of its source just as no wave however mighty can be independent of the ocean nothing moves without that power he is the only doer but the devas thought this victory is ours this glory is ours it he brahman perceived this and ap peared before them they did not know what mysterious form it was 108 the upanishads m hey said to fire o jataveda all knowing find out what mysterious spirit this is he said yes iv e ran towards it and he brahman said to him who art thour ti am agni i am jataveda he the firegod replied vv rahman asked what power resides in thee agni replied i can burn up all whatsoever exists on earth vi rahman placed a straw before him and said burn this he agni rushed towards it with all speed but was not able to burn it so he returned from there and said to the devas i was not able to find out what this great mystery is kenau panishad 10g vii hen they said to vayu the airgod vayu find out what this mystery is he said yes viii e ran towards it and he brahman said to him who art thou i am vayu i am maatarisva traveller of heaven he vayu said ix hen the brahman said what power is in thee vayu replied i can blow away all whatsoever exists on earth x rahman placed a straw before him and said blow this away he vayu rushed towards it with all speed but was not able to blow it away so he returned from there and said to the devas i was not able to find out what this great mystery is 110 the upanishads xi hen they said to indra o mag havan worshipful one find out what this mystery is he said yes and ran towards it but it disappeared before him xii hen he saw in that very space a woman beautifully adorned um of golden hue daughter of haimavat himalaya he asked what is this great mystery ere we see how the absolute assumes concrete form to give knowledge of himself to the earnest seeker brahman the impenetrable mystery disappeared and in his place appeared a personal form to represent him this is a subtle way of showing the difference between the absolute and the personal aspects of deity the absolute is declared to be unknowable and unthinkable but he assumes deified personal aspects to make himself known to his devotees thus uma daughter of the himalaya rep resents that personal aspect as the offspring of the infinite being while the himalaya stands as the symbol of the eternal unchangeable one part fourth i he um4 said itis brahman it is through the victory of brahman that ye are victorious then from her words he indra knew that it that mysterious form was brahman uma replied to indra it is to brahman that you owe your victory it is through his power that you live and act he is the agent and you are all only instruments in his hands therefore your idea that this victory is ours this glory is ours is based on ignorance at once indra saw their mistake the devas being puffed up with vanity had thought they themselves had achieved the victory whereas it was brahman for not even a blade of grass can move without his command tl hherefore these devas agni vayu and indra excel other devas because they came nearer to brahman it was they who first knew this spirit as brah man 112 the upanishads ti hherefore indra excels all other devas because he came nearest to brahman and because he first before all others knew this spirit as brahman as vayu and indra were superior to the other devas because they gained a closer vision and they were able to do this because they were purer while indra stands as the head of the devas because he realized the truth directly he reached brahman the significance of this is that whoever comes in direct touch with brahman or the supreme is glorified iv thus the teaching of brahman is here illustrated in regard to the devas he flashed like lightning and appeared and disappeared just as the eye winks teaching as regards the devas was that brahman is the only doer he had appeared before them in mysterious form but the whole of the unfathomable brahman could not be seen in any definite form so at the moment of vanishing he manifested more of his immeasurable glory and fleetness ef action by a sudden dazzling flash of light kenau panishad 113 vv ext the teaching is regarding adhyt man the embodied soul the mind seems to approach him brahman by this mind the seeker again and again remembers and thinks about brahman oy by the mind can the seeker after knowledge approach brahman whose nature in glory and speed has been described as like unto a flash of lightning mind alone can picture the indescribable brahman and mind alone being swift in its nature can follow him it is through the help of this mind that we can think and meditate on brahman and when by constant thought of him the mind becomes purified then like a polished mirror it can reflect his divine glory vi hat brahman is called tadvanam object of adoration he is to be worshipped by the name tadvanam he who knows brahman thus is loved by all beings braeman is the object of adoration and the goal of all beings for this reason he should be worshipped and meditated upon as tadvanam whoever knows him in this aspect becomes one with him and serves as a clear channel through which the blessings of brahman flow out to others the knower of god partakes of all his lovable qualities and is therefore loved by all true devotees ii4 the upanishads vil he disciple asked o master teach me the upanishad the teacher replied the upanishad has been taught thee we have certainly taught thee the upanishad about brahman vill he upanishad is based on tapas prac tice of the control of body mind and senses dama subjugation of the senses karma right performance of prescribed actions the vedas are its limbs truth is its support ix e who knows this wisdom of the upan ishad having been cleansed of all sin becomes established in the blissful eternal and highest abode of brahman in the highest abode of brahman here ends this upanishad kenau panishad its tess upanishad is called kena because it begins with the inquiry by whom kena willed or directed does the mind go towards its object from whom comes life what enables man to speak to hear and see and the teacher in reply gives him the defi nition of brahman the source and basis of existence the spirit of the upanishads is always to show that no matter where we look or what we see or feel in the visible world it all proceeds from one source the prevailing note of all vedic teaching is this one tremendous whole becoming the world and again the world merging in that whole it also strives in various ways to define that source knowing which all else is known and without which no knowledge can be well es tablished so here the teacher replies that which is the eye of the eye the ear of the ear that is the inex haustible river of being which flows on eternally while bubbles of creation rise on the surface live for a time then burst the teacher however warns the disciple that this eye ear mind can never perceive it for it is that which illumines speech and mind which enables eye and ear and all sensefaculties to perform their tasks it is distinct from the known and also it is beyond the un known he who thinks he knows it knows it not because it is never known by those who believe that it can be grasped by the intellect or by the senses but it can be known by him who knows it as the basis of all consciousness the knower of truth says i know it not because he realizes the unbounded infinite nature of the supreme thou art this the visible thou art that the invisible and thou art all that is beyond he declares the ordi nary idea of knowledge is that which is based on sense 116 the upanishads preceptions but the knowledge of an illumined sage is not confined to his senses he has all the knowledge that comes from the senses and all that comes from spirit the special purpose of this upanishad is to give us the knowledge of the real that we may not come under the dominion of the ego by identifying ourselves with our body mind and senses mortals become mortals because they fall under the sway of ego and depend on their own limited physical and mental strength the lesson of the parable of the devas and brahman is that there is no real power no real doer except god he is the eye of the eye the ear of the ear and eyes ears and all our facul ties have no power independent of him when we thus realize him as the underlying reality of our being we transcend death and become immortal
