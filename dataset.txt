Response:
The Bhagavad Gita offers profound insights into various aspects of human experience, including love, fear, emotion, friendship, and stress. Here's a look at these concepts from the perspective of the Gita:

Key Verse:

“Perform your duty and abandon all attachment to success or failure. Such evenness of mind is called yoga.” (Bhagavad Gita 2.48)

Friendship in the Bhagavad Gita is portrayed as an important relationship that should be based on virtue, mutual respect, and spiritual goals.
